# Verbal Verdict

In [Verbal Verdict](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778780/Verbal_Verdict/), you're a novice investigator in 1950's Brooklyn, solving crimes and climbing the ranks by interrogating suspects and solving problems in a detective game powered by artificial intelligence.

Please check the walkthrough video on the [allthingsida channel](https://youtu.be/NQFn-hmmeLQ).

## Tech stack

Verbal Verdict is written using Unity and uses various supporting technologies.

### Whisper.cpp

[Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) ships with the game and uses the base (`ggml-base.en.bin`) and tiny (`ggml-tiny.en.bin`) models.

Whisper allows the player to speak instead of typing, then the audio gets transcribed and passed to the large language model.

### LLM

The [Mistral Instruct 7B v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) model was used as observed in the `gguf-1.gguf` that ships with the game.

In theory, it is possible to use any other model of your choice by simply running `llamafile` with a different model (see below).

### llamafile

[llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) has been used to provide the local web server to serve the game with the Mistral model from above.

To enable logging and prompt display in the game, just kill the llamafile process first then re-run it with the `-v` flag.

Example:
```
"C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Verbal Verdict Demo/Verbal Verdict_Data/StreamingAssets/llamafile-0.6\bin/llamafile"  --port 13333 -m C:/Program" "Files" "(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Verbal" "Verdict" "Demo/Verbal" "Verdict_Data/StreamingAssets/gguf-1.gguf -c 1024 -b 1024 -v --nobrowser -np 1 -ngl 35
```
### LLMUnity

[LLMUnity](https://github.com/undreamai/LLMUnity) is used from the game Unity project to talk to the local LLM server.
