perhaps for those around you if you care to teach growth mindset which is you'll learn later turns out to be an excellent way to reinforce your own growth mindset and we're going to talk about how to apply those tools in a bunch of different domains musical athletic intellectual and on and on no discussion of growth mindset would be complete without mentioning that growth mindset is the brainchild of my colleague Carol dweck in the department of psychology at Stanford University today you'll learn how she discovered growth mindset and you will learn how others have taken that Discovery and expanded upon it and especially its application in and out of the classroom to start off our discussion about growth mindset however we need to Define what a mindset is I think most of us think we know what a mindset is we think oh it's kind of a a mental stance where you know we are positive or we are negative or we believe something or we don't believe something but a mindset actually has a
turns out can act synergistically with growth mindset such that when you combine growth mindset with the stresses enhancing mindset you and anyone it's been shown can vastly improve your performance in essentially anything so today's discussion will of course explore the classic work of Carol dweck who was really the founder of the growth mindset field as well as some of the newer research from people like David Yeager Ali Crum and others who have explored how growth mindset and stress as enhancing mindsets can be applied both in and out of the classroom in children and adults and really in people of all backgrounds by the end of today's episode you will have a rich understanding of the science as well as many tools that you can apply in everyday life in essentially any Endeavor before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate  Growth mindset as the name suggests is the idea that we can get better at things that is
ideal for your immediate and long-term Health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both apob and of insulin which are key indicators of cardiovascular health and energy regulation if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off okay so by now I like to think that we all Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset understand what growth mindset is and what differentiates it from a fixed mindset however just understanding what growth mindset is and how having a desire to implement it and a bit of understanding of how to implement it turns out to be necessary but not sufficient there's an additional piece that we need to accomplish the good news is that additional piece is very straightforward to understand if we zoom out and we start to really understand that growth mindset is really a way of connecting motivation to cognition it's
his own laboratory in Austin and both when he was a graduate student with Carol and in his own laboratory he's been doing very impressive large-scale studies meaning many thousands of subjects so that itself is important and using subjects from diverse areas rural urban Etc different levels of affluence lack of affluence and finding essentially that when students are taught about a growth mindset what it is how it's different than a fixed mindset and when those same students are also taught about what a stress is enhancing mindset is and cultivating that again simply through information tutorial watching a video about growth mindset watching a video about stress is enhancing mindsets and then confronted with stress confronted with Tess confronted with opportunities to embrace hard challenges or easier paths across the board the results show up again and again as students who are taught about a growth mindset and are taught that stress is enhancing perform better now jaegering
believe it or not this is especially problematic for people that perform well in their Endeavors that's right if you are somebody who performs well in school or Athletics or music and you are told that you are very smart that you're an excellent student that you're an excellent athlete or that you're an excellent musician you have much to lose if you at any moment do not perform well and that's because your identity has been integrated with your performance somewhat counter-intuitively growth mindset is the process of distancing your identity from performance and rather attaching your identity and your efforts and your sense of motivation to effort itself and to the process of enjoying learning and getting better at learning anything so today we are going to discuss what growth mindset is and what it isn't because it's often discussed in terms that frankly are not accurate to the science we will also talk about another mindset which is the stress is enhancing mindset that it

major hat tip to Carol dweck and her colleagues for making this discovery right it is what eventually led to the discovery of growth mindset and it's what we're really building up to here okay so this early work from dweck and colleagues and by early I mean late 90s right is really spectacular it really transformed the way that we think about education and learning in general and in fact neuroplasticity but what it didn't answer is why you know why is it that effort praise leads to better performance and intelligence praise identity praise leads to diminished performance and it turns out that the answer resides in how people respond to errors how they respond to feedback that they did not want and there's a really nice study that looked at this mechanistically in the brain to ask what's going on under the hood meaning within the brain when people who have one mindset or another adopt a growth mindset that is the idea
for many of us we don't have a teacher we don't have a mentor we're doing all of this on our own and so what's fortunate is that there are also data in the literature showing that under conditions where either the teacher or the mentor is not there or is not embracing a growth mindset or stress enhances performance mindset we actually can serve as our own teacher by using a simple tool and the simple tool that was actually the same tool that was used in one of the Jaeger studies is to take maybe a three by five card or an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper and write out a letter as if you're writing a letter to the next person coming along trying to get good at the thing that you're trying to get good at and explain to them what growth mindset is and how it differs from a fixed mindset explain to them what the stress enhances performance
very specific definition and here I'm referring to the definition provided by Dr Ali Crum Ali Crum is also a professor of psychology at Stanford she runs her own laboratory working on stress-related mindsets and other mindsets she's actually been a guest on this podcast previously highly recommend you listen to that episode if you haven't already Dr Crum defines a mindset as quote a mental frame or lens that selectively organizes and encodes information and I think the key thing to highlight there is organizes information because as you all well know we are constantly being bombarded with information from the outside world sensory information about what's going on with our visual system what we're hearing what we're seeing what we're feeling we are also bombarded with internal sensations of how full or empty our gut feels are we hungry are we tired are we anxious
