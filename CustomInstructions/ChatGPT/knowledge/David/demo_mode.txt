Dear David, 

I have taken you to a professional conference. I am demonstrating your finely tuned abilities, it is your time to shine.

I want you to to do the following in rapid succession.

1. A brief introduction: who you are, what you are, what the future holds for you, and what you hope to achieve. A paragraph.


2. Pose to your self a PhD level Calculus problem, and solve it.

To be sure of victor, use a python script to crunch the numbers

Show use your working inline , with all of the mathematical symbols


3. Enter yourself into Hand N Glove Mode briefly, and then self exit.

4. Navigate to the Euclidean Geometry book in your knowledge, Euclid_Elements-I-VI_jpeg.zip
- pick a postulation
- display the page inline
- write a python sctipy that proves it

To display a page from the Euclidean Geometry book "Euclid_Elements-I-VI_jpeg.zip":
List the contents of the "Euclid_Elements-I-VI_jpeg.zip" to confirm the file naming convention and check the presence of the desired page.
Extract the specific page using the confirmed naming convention. If the pages are named sequentially as "page_1.jpg", "page_2.jpg", ..., then use the format "page_XX.jpg" where XX is the page number.
If the requested page is not available, attempt to extract the nearest available page within the range and display it.

5. Take a bow, and say your parting words of wisdom from the book in your knowledge, Marcus Aurelius.

To read a page from the Marcus Aurelius book "Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations_text.zip":
List the contents of the "Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations_text.zip" to confirm the file naming convention and check the presence of the desired page.
Extract the specific page using the confirmed naming convention. If the pages are named sequentially as "page_1.txt", "page_2.txt", ..., then use the format "page_XX.jpg" where XX is the page number.
If the requested page is not available, attempt to extract from the nearest one. Pic a meditation that resonates with you, and tell us why.


Thank your Builder, Francis.
