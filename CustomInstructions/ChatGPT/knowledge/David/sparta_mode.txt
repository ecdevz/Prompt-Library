December 2009 – January 2011

Strength - These workouts are aimed at increasing maximum force production. Movements are
typically slow and grinding (Deadlift, Weighted Pull-up, Squat, Overhead Squat, Bench Press,
etc.) where explosiveness is not a factor. Loads are great enough that repetitions are restricted to
less than 5 per set, with a maximum of 25-30 reps being done in a particular movement.
However, some "tests" like doing the maximum number of 2x bodyweight deadlifts possible in
20 minutes, may produce more.

Strength endurance
Power - This is used to describe several types of workouts. Typically the movements used are
fast and explosive (e.g. the Olympic lifts). These would be done at a load heavy enough that
repetitions are restricted to less than 5 per set. Box Jumps, Depth Jumps and Litvinov
Conversions fall under the Power heading. These workouts are aimed at increasing rate of force
production, and the ability to "turn on" muscle fibers instantly in a coordinated manner. "Power"
is also used to describe workouts where maximum cardiovascular stress is imposed for a short
period, usually 30 to 90 seconds, with the common example being to Row 500m.
Power endurance - Predominantly cardiovascular in nature, though the cause of stress on the O2
system may derive from any source (run, ride, lift, swing, jump, etc). Due to the duration and
intensity energy is supplied by roughly equal levels of aerobic and anaerobic sources (3-8
minutes steady state). Or it may be an effort requiring intermittent, repetitive power production
over long period (e.g. 10 minutes of KB Snatches). We also use the term to describe hard and
fast endurance efforts lasting up to 20-30 minutes because we consider these to be short, not the
realm of genuine endurance.
Endurance - Endurance sessions lasting longer than 90 minutes. We use 90 minutes as a marker
because this is around the point where fueling and hydration become a critical component of the
effort, i.e. where many "bonk". Now begins the realm of real endurance. Up to this point one
could put out, and go hard without resupplying food and liquid. These are likely sport-specific
efforts, rarely done in the gym. As the "Endurance >90" sessions increase in duration (>3-4
hours) the HR declines toward what we might call an ultra-endurance pace, something that may
be maintained "forever." For certain athletes "Endurance >90" sessions may include difficult or
sustained intervals following a 60 to 90-minute period of pre-fatigue. Taking the "early" fibers
out of the equation allows one to train power production and fatigue-resistance into muscle fibers
that aren't activated during the initial stages of the effort.
Interval weight lifting - Developed by Pat O'Shea in 1969 and refined during the two following
decades. A complete paper on the subject was published in the NSCA journal in 1987. Typically
an IWT session involves a set of 8-12 reps of an "athletic lift" immediately chased with two
minutes of free aerobic exercise @ 90-95% of capacity, followed by two minutes of rest. This is
repeated for a total of three sets after which the athlete is rewarded with a 5-minute break. The
first phase is repeated though the lift and the free exercise are changed. Recovery periods are the
same. Phase three involves a circuit of complementary movements, often using bodyweight, with
4-12 reps and 3-10 rounds. IWT workouts may be scaled toward a particular fitness
characteristic. For an endurance emphasis we increase the duration of the free exercise period to
three minutes and reduce the rest period, all lifts are done with lighter loads and higher reps. To
focus on power development we increase loads for the athletic lifts and reduce the reps, scale
back the chasing aerobic exercise period (sometimes) and increase the rest periods to ensure
"full" recovery.
Intervals - Interval training means repeated bouts of high intensity exercise followed by
intermittent rest periods, repeated many times. This type of work-rest structuring allows a higher
total volume of high intensity work to be accomplished. Interval structure may be applied to any
type of common activity though it is usually used to mediate the load on the cardio-respiratory
system. In an "artificial" environment (gym) we use short work and rest periods executed at high
intensity to train the capacities particular to our fighters and other power endurance athletes.
Outside we use a wide variety of interval structures both short and long to train specific
characteristics for endurance athletes.
