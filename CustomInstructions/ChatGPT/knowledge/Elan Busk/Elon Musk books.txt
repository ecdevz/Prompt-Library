ELON’S WORLD
DO YOU THINK I’M INSANE?”
This question came from Elon Musk near the very end of a long dinner
we shared at a high-end seafood restaurant in Silicon Valley. I’d gotten to
the restaurant first and settled down with a gin and tonic, knowing Musk
would—as ever—be late. After about fifteen minutes, Musk showed up
wearing leather shoes, designer jeans, and a plaid dress shirt. Musk stands
six foot one but ask anyone who knows him and they’ll confirm that he
seems much bigger than that. He’s absurdly broad-shouldered, sturdy, and
thick. You’d figure he would use this frame to his advantage and perform an
alpha-male strut when entering a room. Instead, he tends to be almost
sheepish. It’s head tilted slightly down while walking, a quick handshake
hello after reaching the table, and then butt in seat. From there, Musk needs
a few minutes before he warms up and looks at ease.
Musk asked me to dinner for a negotiation of sorts. Eighteen months
earlier, I’d informed him of my plans to write a book about him, and he’d
informed me of his plans not to cooperate. His rejection stung but thrust me
into dogged reporter mode. If I had to do this book without him, so be it.
Plenty of people had left Musk’s companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, and
would talk, and I already knew a lot of his friends. The interviews followed
one after another, month after month, and two hundred or so people into the
process, I heard from Musk once again. He called me at home and declared
that things could go one of two ways: he could make my life very difficult
or he could help with the project after all. He’d be willing to cooperate if he
could read the book before it went to publication, and could add footnotes
throughout it. He would not meddle with my text, but he wanted the chance
to set the record straight in spots that he deemed factually inaccurate. I
understood where this was coming from. Musk wanted a measure of control
over his life’s story. He’s also wired like a scientist and suffers mental
anguish at the sight of a factual error. A mistake on a printed page would
gnaw at his soul—forever. While I could understand his perspective, I could
not let him read the book, for professional, personal, and practical reasons.
Musk has his version of the truth, and it’s not always the version of the truth
that the rest of the world shares. He’s prone to verbose answers to even the
simplest of questions as well, and the thought of thirty-page footnotes
seemed all too real. Still, we agreed to have dinner, chat all this out, and see
where it left us.
Our conversation began with a discussion of public-relations people.
Musk burns through PR staffers notoriously fast, and Tesla was in the
process of hunting for a new communications chief. “Who is the best PR
person in the world?” he asked in a very Muskian fashion. Then we talked
about mutual acquaintances, Howard Hughes, and the Tesla factory. When
the waiter stopped by to take our order, Musk asked for suggestions that
would work with his low-carb diet. He settled on chunks of fried lobster
soaked in black squid ink. The negotiation hadn’t begun, and Musk was
already dishing. He opened up about the major fear keeping him up at night:
namely that Google’s cofounder and CEO Larry Page might well have been
building a fleet of artificial-intelligence-enhanced robots capable of
destroying mankind. “I’m really worried about this,” Musk said. It didn’t
make Musk feel any better that he and Page were very close friends and that
he felt Page was fundamentally a well-intentioned person and not Dr. Evil.
In fact, that was sort of the problem. Page’s nice-guy nature left him
assuming that the machines would forever do our bidding. “I’m not as
optimistic,” Musk said. “He could produce something evil by accident.” As
the food arrived, Musk consumed it. That is, he didn’t eat it as much as he
made it disappear rapidly with a few gargantuan bites. Desperate to keep
Musk happy and chatting, I handed him a big chunk of steak from my plate.
The plan worked . . . for all of ninety seconds. Meat. Hunk. Gone.
It took awhile to get Musk off the artificial intelligence doom-andgloom
talk and to the subject at hand. Then, as we drifted toward the book,
Musk started to feel me out, probing exactly why it was that I wanted to
write about him and calculating my intentions. When the moment presented
itself, I moved in and seized the conversation. Some adrenaline released and
mixed with the gin, and I launched into what was meant to be a forty-fiveminute
sermon about all the reasons Musk should let me burrow deep into
his life and do so while getting exactly none of the controls he wanted in
return. The speech revolved around the inherent limitations of footnotes,
Musk coming off like a control freak and my journalistic integrity being
compromised. To my great surprise, Musk cut me off after a couple of
minutes and simply said, “Okay.” One thing that Musk holds in the highest
regard is resolve, and he respects people who continue on after being told
no. Dozens of other journalists had asked him to help with a book before,
but I’d been the only annoying asshole who continued on after Musk’s
initial rejection, and he seemed to like that.
The dinner wound down with pleasant conversation and Musk laying
waste to the low-carb diet. A waiter showed up with a giant yellow cotton
candy desert sculpture, and Musk dug into it, ripping off handfuls of the
sugary fluff. It was settled. Musk granted me access to the executives at his
companies, his friends, and his family. He would meet me for dinner once a
month for as long as it took. For the first time, Musk would let a reporter
see the inner workings of his world. Two and a half hours after we started,
Musk put his hands on the table, made a move to get up, and then paused,
locked eyes with me, and busted out that incredible question: “Do you think
I’m insane?” The oddity of the moment left me speechless for a beat, while
my every synapse fired trying to figure out if this was some sort of riddle,
and, if so, how it should be answered artfully. It was only after I’d spent lots
of time with Musk that I realized the question was more for him than me.
Nothing I said would have mattered. Musk was stopping one last time and
wondering aloud if I could be trusted and then looking into my eyes to
make his judgment. A split second later, we shook hands and Musk drove
off in a red Tesla Model S sedan.
ANY STUDY OF ELON MUSK must begin at the headquarters of SpaceX,
in Hawthorne, California—a suburb of Los Angeles located a few miles
from Los Angeles International Airport. It’s there that visitors will find two
giant posters of Mars hanging side by side on the wall leading up to Musk’s
cubicle. The poster to the left depicts Mars as it is today—a cold, barren red
orb. The poster on the right shows a Mars with a humongous green
landmass surrounded by oceans. The planet has been heated up and
transformed to suit humans. Musk fully intends to try and make this happen.
Turning humans into space colonizers is his stated life’s purpose. “I would
like to die thinking that humanity has a bright future,” he said. “If we can
solve sustainable energy and be well on our way to becoming a
multiplanetary species with a self-sustaining civilization on another planet
—to cope with a worst-case scenario happening and extinguishing human
consciousness—then,” and here he paused for a moment, “I think that
would be really good.”
If some of the things that Musk says and does sound absurd, that’s
because on one level they very much are. On this occasion, for example,
Musk’s assistant had just handed him some cookies-and-cream ice cream
with sprinkles on top, and he then talked earnestly about saving humanity
while a blotch of the dessert hung from his lower lip.
Musk’s ready willingness to tackle impossible things has turned him
into a deity in Silicon Valley, where fellow CEOs like Page speak of him in
reverential awe, and budding entrepreneurs strive “to be like Elon” just as
they had been striving in years past to mimic Steve Jobs. Silicon Valley,
though, operates within a warped version of reality, and outside the confines
of its shared fantasy, Musk often comes off as a much more polarizing
figure. He’s the guy with the electric cars, solar panels, and rockets
peddling false hope. Forget Steve Jobs. Musk is a sci-fi version of P. T.
Barnum who has gotten extraordinarily rich by preying on people’s fear and
self-hatred. Buy a Tesla. Forget about the mess you’ve made of the planet
for a while.
I’d long been a subscriber to this latter camp. Musk had struck me as a
well-intentioned dreamer—a card-carrying member of Silicon Valley’s
techno-utopian club. This group tends to be a mix of Ayn Rand devotees
and engineer absolutists who see their hyperlogical worldviews as the
Answer for everyone. If we’d just get out of their way, they’d fix all our
problems. One day, soon enough, we’ll be able to download our brains to a
computer, relax, and let their algorithms take care of everything. Much of
their ambition proves inspiring and their works helpful. But the technoutopians
do get tiresome with their platitudes and their ability to prattle on
for hours without saying much of substance. More disconcerting is their
underlying message that humans are flawed and our humanity is an
annoying burden that needs to be dealt with in due course. When I’d caught
Musk at Silicon Valley events, his highfalutin talk often sounded straight
out of the techno-utopian playbook. And, most annoyingly, his worldsaving
companies didn’t even seem to be doing all that well.
Yet, in the early part of 2012, the cynics like me had to take notice of
what Musk was actually accomplishing. His once-beleaguered companies
were succeeding at unprecedented things. SpaceX flew a supply capsule to
the International Space Station and brought it safely back to Earth. Tesla
Motors delivered the Model S, a beautiful, all-electric sedan that took the
automotive industry’s breath away and slapped Detroit sober. These two
feats elevated Musk to the rarest heights among business titans. Only Steve
Jobs could claim similar achievements in two such different industries,
sometimes putting out a new Apple product and a blockbuster Pixar movie
in the same year. And yet, Musk was not done. He was also the chairman
and largest shareholder of SolarCity, a booming solar energy company
poised to file for an initial public offering. Musk had somehow delivered
the biggest advances the space, automotive, and energy industries had seen
in decades in what felt like one fell swoop.
It was in 2012 that I decided to see what Musk was like firsthand and to
write a cover story about him for Bloomberg Businessweek. At this point in
Musk’s life, everything ran through his assistant/loyal appendage Mary
Beth Brown. She invited me to visit what I’ve come to refer to as Musk
Land.
Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same
head-scratching experience. You’re told to park at One Rocket Road in
Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything
good could call Hawthorne home. It’s a bleak part of Los Angeles County
in which groupings of rundown houses, run-down shops, and run-down
eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built
during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon
Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck? Then, okay,
things start to make more sense when you see one 550,000-square-foot
rectangle painted an ostentatious hue of “Unity of Body, Soul, and Mind”
white. This is the main SpaceX building.
It was only after going through the front doors of SpaceX that the
grandeur of what this man had done became apparent. Musk had built an
honest-to-God rocket factory in the middle of Los Angeles. And this factory
was not making one rocket at a time. No. It was making many rockets—
from scratch. The factory was a giant, shared work area. Near the back were
massive delivery bays that allowed for the arrival of hunks of metal, which
were transported to two-story-high welding machines. Over to one side
were technicians in white coats making motherboards, radios, and other
electronics. Other people were in a special, airtight glass chamber, building
the capsules that rockets would take to the Space Station. Tattooed men in
bandanas were blasting Van Halen and threading wires around rocket
engines. There were completed bodies of rockets lined up one after the
other ready to be placed on trucks. Still more rockets, in another part of the
building, awaited coats of white paint. It was difficult to take in the entire
factory at once. There were hundreds of bodies in constant motion whirring
around a variety of bizarre machines.
This is just building number one of Musk Land. SpaceX had acquired
several buildings that used to be part of a Boeing factory, which made the
fuselages for 747s. One of these buildings has a curved roof and looks like
an airplane hangar. It serves as the research, development, and design studio
for Tesla. This is where the company came up with the look for the Model S
sedan and its follow-on, the Model X SUV. In the parking lot outside the
studio, Tesla has built one of its recharging stations where Los Angeles
drivers can top up with electricity for free. The charging center is easy
enough to spot because Musk has installed a white and red obelisk branded
with the Tesla logo that sits in the middle of an infinity pool.
It was in my first interview with Musk, which took place at the design
studio, that I began to get a sense of how he talked and operated. He’s a
confident guy, but does not always do a good job of displaying this. On
initial encounter, Musk can come off as shy and borderline awkward. His
South African accent remains present but fading, and the charm of it is not
enough to offset the halting nature of Musk’s speech pattern. Like many an
engineer or physicist, Musk will pause while fishing around for exact
phrasing, and he’ll often go rumbling down an esoteric, scientific rabbit
hole without providing any helping hands or simplified explanations along
the way. Musk expects you to keep up. None of this is off-putting. Musk, in
fact, will toss out plenty of jokes and can be downright charming. It’s just
that there’s a sense of purpose and pressure hanging over any conversation
with the man. Musk doesn’t really shoot the shit. (It would end up taking
about thirty hours of interviews for Musk to really loosen up and let me into
a different, deeper level of his psyche and personality.)
Most high-profile CEOs have handlers all around them. Musk mostly
moves about Musk Land on his own. This is not the guy who slinks into the
restaurant. It’s the guy who owns the joint and strides about with authority.
Musk and I talked, as he made his way around the design studio’s main
floor, inspecting prototype parts and vehicles. At each station, employees
rushed up to Musk and disgorged information. He listened intently,
processed it, and nodded when satisfied. The people moved away and Musk
moved to the next information dump. At one point, Tesla’s design chief,
Franz von Holzhausen, wanted Musk’s take on some new tires and rims that
had come in for the Model S and on the seating arrangements for the Model
X. They spoke, and then they went into a back room where executives from
a seller of high-end graphics software had prepared a presentation for Musk.
They wanted to show off new 3-D rendering technology that would allow
Tesla to tweak the finish of a virtual Model S and see in great detail how
things like shadows and streetlights played off the car’s body. Tesla’s
engineers really wanted the computing systems and needed Musk’s sign-off.
The men did their best to sell Musk on the idea while the sound of drills and
giant industrial fans drowned out their shtick. Musk, wearing leather shoes,
designer jeans, and a black T-shirt, which is essentially his work uniform,
had to don 3-D goggles for the demonstration and seemed unmoved. He
told them he’d think about it and then walked toward the source of the
loudest noise—a workshop deep in the design studio where Tesla engineers
were building the scaffolding for the thirty-foot decorative towers that go
outside the charging stations. “That thing looks like it could survive a
Category Five hurricane,” Musk said. “Let’s thin it up a bit.” Musk and I
eventually hop into his car—a black Model S—and zip back to the main
SpaceX building. “I think there are probably too many smart people
pursuing Internet stuff, finance, and law,” Musk said on the way. “That is
part of the reason why we haven’t seen as much innovation.”
MUSK LAND WAS A REVELATION.
I’d come to Silicon Valley in 2000 and ended up living in the Tenderloin
neighborhood of San Francisco. It’s the one part of the city that locals will
implore you to avoid. Without trying very hard, you can find someone
pulling down his pants and pooping in between parked cars or encounter
some deranged sort bashing his head into the side of a bus stop. At dive bars
near the local strip clubs, transvestites hit on curious businessmen and
drunks fall asleep on couches and soil themselves as part of their lazy
Sunday ritual. It’s the gritty, knife-stabby part of San Francisco and turned
out to be a great place to watch the dotcom dream die.
San Francisco has an enduring history with greed. It became a city on
the back of the gold rush, and not even a catastrophic earthquake could slow
San Francisco’s economic lust for long. Don’t let the granola vibes fool
you. Booms and busts are the rhythm of this place. And, in 2000, San
Francisco had been overtaken by the boom of all booms and consumed by
avarice. It was a wonderful time to be alive with just about the entire
populace giving in to a fantasy—a get-rich-quick, Internet madness. The
pulses of energy from this shared delusion were palpable, producing a
constant buzz that vibrated across the city. And here I was in the center of
the most depraved part of San Francisco, watching just how high and low
people get when consumed by excess.
Stories tracking the insanity of business in these times are well-known.
You no longer had to make something that other people wanted to buy in
order to start a booming company. You just had to have an idea for some
sort of Internet thing and announce it to the world in order for eager
investors to fund your thought experiment. The whole goal was to make as
much money as possible in the shortest amount of time because everyone
knew on at least a subconscious level that reality had to set in eventually.
Valley denizens took very literally the cliché of working as hard as you
play. People in their twenties, thirties, forties, and fifties were expected to
pull all-nighters. Cubicles were turned into temporary homes, and personal
hygiene was abandoned. Oddly enough, making Nothing appear to be
Something took a lot of work. But when the time to decompress arrived,
there were plenty of options for total debauchery. The hot companies and
media powers of the time seemed locked in a struggle to outdo each other
with ever-fancier parties. Old-line companies trying to look “with it” would
regularly buy space at a concert venue and then order up some dancers,
acrobats, open bars, and the Barenaked Ladies. Young technologists would
show up to pound their free Jack and Cokes and snort their cocaine in portapotties.
Greed and self-interest were the only things that made any sense
back then.
While the good times have been well chronicled, the subsequent bad
times have been—unsurprisingly—ignored. It’s more fun to reminiscence
on irrational exuberance than the mess that gets left behind.
Let it be said for the record, then, that the implosion of the get-richquick
Internet fantasy left San Francisco and Silicon Valley in a deep
depression. The endless parties ended. The prostitutes no longer roamed the
streets of the Tenderloin at 6 A.M. offering pre-commute love. (“Come on,
honey. It’s better than coffee!”) Instead of the Barenaked Ladies, you got
the occasional Neil Diamond tribute band at a trade show, some free Tshirts,
and a lump of shame.
The technology industry had no idea what to do with itself. The dumb
venture capitalists who had been taken during the bubble didn’t want to
look any dumber, so they stopped funding new ventures altogether.
Entrepreneurs’ big ideas were replaced by the smallest of notions. It was as
if Silicon Valley had entered rehab en masse. It sounds melodramatic, but
it’s true. A populace of millions of clever people came to believe that they
were inventing the future. Then . . . poof! Playing it safe suddenly became
the fashionable thing to do.
The evidence of this malaise is in the companies and ideas formed
during this period. Google had appeared and really started to thrive around
2002, but it was an outlier. Between Google and Apple’s introduction of the
iPhone in 2007, there’s a wasteland of ho-hum companies. And the hot new
things that were just starting out—Facebook and Twitter—certainly did not
look like their predecessors—Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Sun Microsystems—
that made physical products and employed tens of thousands of people in
the process. In the years that followed, the goal went from taking huge risks
to create new industries and grand new ideas, to chasing easier money by
entertaining consumers and pumping out simple apps and advertisements.
“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people
click ads,” Jeff Hammerbacher, an early Facebook engineer, told me. “That
sucks.” Silicon Valley began to look an awful lot like Hollywood.
Meanwhile, the consumers it served had turned inward, obsessed with their
virtual lives.
One of the first people to suggest that this lull in innovation could signal
a much larger problem was Jonathan Huebner, a physicist who works at the
Pentagon’s Naval Air Warfare Center in China Lake, California. Huebner is
the Leave It to Beaver version of a merchant of death. Middle-aged, thin,
and balding, he likes to wear a dirt-inspired ensemble of khaki pants, a
brown-striped shirt, and a canvas khaki jacket. He has designed weapons
systems since 1985, gaining direct insight into the latest and greatest
technology around materials, energy, and software. Following the dot-com
bust, he became miffed at the ho-hum nature of the supposed innovations
crossing his desk. In 2005, Huebner delivered a paper, “A Possible
Declining Trend in Worldwide Innovation,” which was either an indictment
of Silicon Valley or at least an ominous warning.
Huebner opted to use a tree metaphor to describe what he saw as the
state of innovation. Man has already climbed past the trunk of the tree and
gone out on its major limbs, mining most of the really big, game-changing
ideas—the wheel, electricity, the airplane, the telephone, the transistor. Now
we’re left dangling near the end of the branches at the top of the tree and
mostly just refining past inventions. To back up his point in the paper,
Huebner showed that the frequency of life-changing inventions had started
to slow. He also used data to prove that the number of patents filed per
person had declined over time. “I think the probability of us discovering
another top-one-hundred-type invention gets smaller and smaller,” Huebner
told me in an interview. “Innovation is a finite resource.”
Huebner predicted that it would take people about five years to catch on
to his thinking, and this forecast proved almost exactly right. Around 2010,
Peter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder and early Facebook investor, began
promoting the idea that the technology industry had let people down. “We
wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” became the tagline of his
venture capital firm Founders Fund. In an essay called “What Happened to
the Future,” Thiel and his cohorts described how Twitter, its 140-character
messages, and similar inventions have let the public down. He argued that
science fiction, which once celebrated the future, has turned dystopian
because people no longer have an optimistic view of technology’s ability to
change the world.
I’d subscribed to a lot of this type of thinking until that first visit to
Musk Land. While Musk had been anything but shy about what he was up
to, few people outside of his companies got to see the factories, the R&D
centers, the machine shops, and to witness the scope of what he was doing
firsthand. Here was a guy who had taken much of the Silicon Valley ethic
behind moving quickly and running organizations free of bureaucratic
hierarchies and applied it to improving big, fantastic machines and chasing
things that had the potential to be the real breakthroughs we’d been missing.
By rights, Musk should have been part of the malaise. He jumped right
into dot-com mania in 1995, when, fresh out of college, he founded a
company called Zip2—a primitive Google Maps meets Yelp. That first
venture ended up a big, quick hit. Compaq bought Zip2 in 1999 for $307
million. Musk made $22 million from the deal and poured almost all of it
into his next venture, a start-up that would morph into PayPal. As the
largest shareholder in PayPal, Musk became fantastically well-to-do when
eBay acquired the company for $1.5 billion in 2002.
Instead of hanging around Silicon Valley and falling into the same funk
as his peers, however, Musk decamped to Los Angeles. The conventional
wisdom of the time said to take a deep breath and wait for the next big thing
to arrive in due course. Musk rejected that logic by throwing $100 million
into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. Short
of building an actual money-crushing machine, Musk could not have picked
a faster way to destroy his fortune. He became a one-man, ultra-risk-taking
venture capital shop and doubled down on making super-complex physical
goods in two of the most expensive places in the world, Los Angeles and
Silicon Valley. Whenever possible, Musk’s companies would make things
from scratch and try to rethink much that the aerospace, automotive, and
solar industries had accepted as convention.
With SpaceX, Musk is battling the giants of the U.S. military-industrial
complex, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. He’s also battling nations
—most notably Russia and China. SpaceX has made a name for itself as the
low-cost supplier in the industry. But that, in and of itself, is not really good
enough to win. The space business requires dealing with a mess of politics,
back-scratching, and protectionism that undermines the fundamentals of
capitalism. Steve Jobs faced similar forces when he went up against the
recording industry to bring the iPod and iTunes to market. The crotchety
Luddites in the music industry were a pleasure to deal with compared to
Musk’s foes who build weapons and countries for a living. SpaceX has been
testing reusable rockets that can carry payloads to space and land back on
Earth, on their launchpads, with precision. If the company can perfect this
technology, it will deal a devastating blow to all of its competitors and
almost assuredly push some mainstays of the rocket industry out of business
while establishing the United States as the world leader for taking cargo and
humans to space. It’s a threat that Musk figures has earned him plenty of
fierce enemies. “The list of people that would not mind if I was gone is
growing,” Musk said. “My family fears that the Russians will assassinate
me.”
With Tesla Motors, Musk has tried to revamp the way cars are
manufactured and sold, while building out a worldwide fuel distribution
network at the same time. Instead of hybrids, which in Musk lingo are
suboptimal compromises, Tesla strives to make all-electric cars that people
lust after and that push the limits of technology. Tesla does not sell these
cars through dealers; it sells them on the Web and in Apple-like galleries
located in high-end shopping centers. Tesla also does not anticipate making
lots of money from servicing its vehicles, since electric cars do not require
the oil changes and other maintenance procedures of traditional cars. The
direct sales model embraced by Tesla stands as a major affront to car
dealers used to haggling with their customers and making their profits from
exorbitant maintenance fees. Tesla’s recharging stations now run alongside
many of the major highways in the United States, Europe, and Asia and can
add hundreds of miles of oomph back to a car in about twenty minutes.
These so-called supercharging stations are solar-powered, and Tesla owners
pay nothing to refuel. While much of America’s infrastructure decays,
Musk is building a futuristic end-to-end transportation system that would
allow the United States to leapfrog the rest of the world. Musk’s vision, and,
of late, execution seem to combine the best of Henry Ford and John D.
Rockefeller.
With SolarCity, Musk has funded the largest installer and financer of
solar panels for consumers and businesses. Musk helped come up with the
idea for SolarCity and serves as its chairman, while his cousins Lyndon and
Peter Rive run the company. SolarCity has managed to undercut dozens of
utilities and become a large utility in its own right. During a time in which
clean-tech businesses have gone bankrupt with alarming regularity, Musk
has built two of the most successful clean-tech companies in the world. The
Musk Co. empire of factories, tens of thousands of workers, and industrial
might has incumbents on the run and has turned Musk into one of the
richest men in the world, with a net worth around $10 billion.
The visit to Musk Land started to make a few things clear about how
Musk had pulled all this off. While the “putting man on Mars” talk can
strike some people as loopy, it gave Musk a unique rallying cry for his
companies. It’s the sweeping goal that forms a unifying principle over
everything he does. Employees at all three companies are well aware of this
and well aware that they’re trying to achieve the impossible day in and day
out. When Musk sets unrealistic goals, verbally abuses employees, and
works them to the bone, it’s understood to be—on some level—part of the
Mars agenda. Some employees love him for this. Others loathe him but
remain oddly loyal out of respect for his drive and mission. What Musk has
developed that so many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley lack is a
meaningful worldview. He’s the possessed genius on the grandest quest
anyone has ever concocted. He’s less a CEO chasing riches than a general
marshaling troops to secure victory. Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help
you share baby photos, Musk wants to . . . well . . . save the human race
from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.
The life that Musk has created to manage all of these endeavors is
preposterous. A typical week starts at his mansion in Bel Air. On Monday,
he works the entire day at SpaceX. On Tuesday, he begins at SpaceX, then
hops onto his jet and flies to Silicon Valley. He spends a couple of days
working at Tesla, which has its offices in Palo Alto and factory in Fremont.
Musk does not own a home in Northern California and ends up staying at
the luxe Rosewood hotel or at friends’ houses. To arrange the stays with
friends, Musk’s assistant will send an e-mail asking, “Room for one?” and if
the friend says, “Yes,” Musk turns up at the door late at night. Most often he
stays in a guest room, but he’s also been known to crash on the couch after
winding down with some video games. Then it’s back to Los Angeles and
SpaceX on Thursday. He shares custody of his five young boys—twins and
triplets—with his ex-wife, Justine, and has them four days a week. Each
year, Musk tabulates the amount of flight time he endures per week to help
him get a sense of just how out of hand things are getting. Asked how he
survives this schedule, Musk said, “I had a tough childhood, so maybe that
was helpful.”
During one visit to Musk Land, he had to squeeze our interview in
before heading off for a camping trip at Crater Lake National Park in
Oregon. It was almost 8 P.M. on a Friday, so Musk would soon be piling his
boys and nannies into his private jet and then meeting drivers who would
take him to his friends at the campsite; the friends would then help the
Musk clan unpack and complete their pitch-black arrival. There would be a
bit of hiking over the weekend. Then the relaxation would end. Musk would
fly with the boys back to Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. Then, he would
take off on his own that evening for New York. Sleep. Hit the morning talk
shows on Monday. Meetings. E-mail. Sleep. Fly back to Los Angeles
Tuesday morning. Work at SpaceX. Fly to San Jose Tuesday afternoon to
visit the Tesla Motors factory. Fly to Washington, D.C., that night and see
President Obama. Fly back to Los Angeles Wednesday night. Spend a
couple of days working at SpaceX. Then go to a weekend conference held
by Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, in Yellowstone. At this time, Musk
had just split from his second wife, the actress Talulah Riley, and was trying
to calculate if he could mix a personal life into all of this. “I think the time
allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,” Musk said. “I would
like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend.
That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even
another five to ten—how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe
ten hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”
Musk rarely finds time to decompress, but when he does, the festivities
are just as dramatic as the rest of his life. On his thirtieth birthday, Musk
rented out a castle in England for about twenty people. From 2 A.M. until 6
A.M., they played a variation of hide-and-seek called sardines in which one
person runs off and hides and everyone else looks for him. Another party
occurred in Paris. Musk, his brother, and cousins found themselves awake
at midnight and decided to bicycle through the city until 6 A.M. They slept
all day and then boarded the Orient Express in the evening. Once again,
they stayed up all night. The Lucent Dossier Experience—an avant-garde
group of performers—were on the luxurious train, performing palm
readings and acrobatics. When the train arrived in Venice the next day,
Musk’s family had dinner and then hung out on the patio of their hotel
overlooking the Grand Canal until 9 A.M. Musk loves costume parties as
well, and turned up at one dressed like a knight and using a parasol to duel a
midget wearing a Darth Vader costume.
For one of his most recent birthdays, Musk invited fifty people to a
castle—or at least the United States’ best approximation of a castle—in
Tarrytown, New York. This party had a Japanese steampunk theme, which
is sort of like a sci-fi lover’s wet dream—a mix of corsets, leather, and
machine worship. Musk dressed as a samurai.
The festivities included a performance of The Mikado, a Victorian
comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan set in Japan, at a small theater in the
heart of town. “I am not sure the Americans got it,” said Riley, whom Musk
remarried after his ten-hour-a-week dating plan failed. The Americans and
everyone else did enjoy what followed. Back at the castle, Musk donned a
blindfold, got pushed up against a wall, and held balloons in each hand and
another between his legs. The knife thrower then went to work. “I’d seen
him before, but did worry that maybe he could have an off day,” Musk said.
“Still, I thought, he would maybe hit one gonad but not both.” The
onlookers were stunned and frightened for Musk’s safety. “That was
bizarre,” said Bill Lee, a technology investor and one of Musk’s good
friends. “But Elon believes in the science of things.” One of the world’s top
sumo wrestlers showed up at the party along with some of his compatriots.
A ring had been set up at the castle, and Musk faced off against the
champion. “He was three hundred and fifty pounds, and they were not
jiggly pounds,” Musk said. “I went full adrenaline rush and managed to lift
the guy off the ground. He let me win that first round and then beat me. I
think my back is still screwed up.”
Riley turned planning these types of parties for Musk into an art. She
met Musk back in 2008, when his companies were collapsing. She watched
him lose his entire fortune and get ridiculed by the press. She knows that
the sting of these years remains and has combined with the other traumas in
Musk’s life—the tragic loss of an infant son and a brutal upbringing in
South Africa—to create a tortured soul. Riley has gone to great lengths to
make sure Musk’s escapes from work and this past leave him feeling
refreshed if not healed. “I try to think of fun things he has not done before
where he can relax,” Riley said. “We’re trying to make up for his miserable
childhood now.”
Genuine as Riley’s efforts might have been, they were not entirely
effective. Not long after the Sumo party, I found Musk back at work at the
Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto. It was a Saturday, and the parking lot was
full of cars. Inside of the Tesla offices, hundreds of young men were at
work—some of them designing car parts on computers and others
conducting experiments with electronics equipment on their desks. Musk’s
uproarious laugh would erupt every few minutes and carry through the
entire floor. When Musk came into the meeting room where I’d been
waiting, I noted how impressive it was for so many people to turn up on a
Saturday. Musk saw the situation in a different light, complaining that fewer
and fewer people had been working weekends of late. “We’ve grown
fucking soft,” Musk replied. “I was just going to send out an e-mail. We’re
fucking soft.” (A word of warning: There’s going to be a lot of “fuck” in
this book. Musk adores the word, and so do most of the people in his inner
circle.)
This kind of declaration seems to fit with our impressions of other
visionaries. It’s not hard to imagine Howard Hughes or Steve Jobs
chastising their workforce in a similar way. Building things—especially big
things—is a messy business. In the two decades Musk has spent creating
companies, he’s left behind a trail of people who either adore or despise
him. During the course of my reporting, these people lined up to give me
their take on Musk and the gory details of how he and his businesses
operate.
My dinners with Musk and periodic trips to Musk Land revealed a
different set of possible truths about the man. He’s set about building
something that has the potential to be much grander than anything Hughes
or Jobs produced. Musk has taken industries like aerospace and automotive
that America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new
and fantastic. At the heart of this transformation are Musk’s skills as a
software maker and his ability to apply them to machines. He’s merged
atoms and bits in ways that few people thought possible, and the results
have been spectacular. It’s true enough that Musk has yet to have a
consumer hit on the order of the iPhone or to touch more than one billion
people like Facebook. For the moment, he’s still making rich people’s toys,
and his budding empire could be an exploded rocket or massive Tesla recall
away from collapse. On the other hand, Musk’s companies have already
accomplished far more than his loudest detractors thought possible, and the
promise of what’s to come has to leave hardened types feeling optimistic
during their weaker moments. “To me, Elon is the shining example of how
Silicon Valley might be able to reinvent itself and be more relevant than
chasing these quick IPOs and focusing on getting incremental products
out,” said Edward Jung, a famed software engineer and inventor. “Those
things are important, but they are not enough. We need to look at different
models of how to do things that are longer term in nature and where the
technology is more integrated.” The integration mentioned by Jung—the
harmonious melding of software, electronics, advanced materials, and
computing horsepower—appears to be Musk’s gift. Squint ever so slightly,
and it looks like Musk could be using his skills to pave the way toward an
age of astonishing machines and science fiction dreams made manifest.
In that sense, Musk comes off much more like Thomas Edison than
Howard Hughes. He’s an inventor, celebrity businessman, and industrialist
able to take big ideas and turn them into big products. He’s employing
thousands of people to forge metal in American factories at a time when this
was thought to be impossible. Born in South Africa, Musk now looks like
America’s most innovative industrialist and outlandish thinker and the
person most likely to set Silicon Valley on a more ambitious course.
Because of Musk, Americans could wake up in ten years with the most
modern highway in the world: a transit system run by thousands of solarpowered
charging stations and traversed by electric cars. By that time,
SpaceX may well be sending up rockets every day, taking people and things
to dozens of habitats and making preparations for longer treks to Mars.
These advances are simultaneously difficult to fathom and seemingly
inevitable if Musk can simply buy enough time to make them work. As his
ex-wife, Justine, put it, “He does what he wants, and he is relentless about
it. It’s Elon’s world, and the rest of us live in it.”

AFRICA
THE PUBLIC FIRST MET ELON REEVE MUSK IN 1984. The South
African trade publication PC and Office Technology published the source
code to a video game Musk had designed. Called Blastar, the sciencefiction-
inspired space game required 167 lines of instructions to run. This
was back in the day when early computer users were required to type out
commands to make their machines do much of anything. In that context,
Musk’s game did not shine as a marvel of computer science but it certainly
surpassed what most twelve-year-olds were kicking out at the time. Its
coverage in the magazine netted Musk five hundred dollars and provided
some early hints about his character. The Blastar spread on page 69 of the
magazine shows that the young man wanted to go by the sci-fi-authorsounding
name E. R. Musk and that he already had visions of grand
conquests dancing in his head. The brief explainer states, “In this game you
have to destroy an alien space freighter, which is carrying deadly Hydrogen
Bombs and Status Beam Machines. This game makes good use of sprites
and animation, and in this sense makes the listing worth reading.” (As of
this writing, not even the Internet knows what “status beam machines” are.)
A boy fantasizing about space and battles between good and evil is
anything but amazing. A boy who takes these fantasies seriously is more
remarkable. Such was the case with the young Elon Musk. By the middle of
his teenage years, Musk had blended fantasy and reality to the point that
they were hard to separate in his mind. Musk came to see man’s fate in the
universe as a personal obligation. If that meant pursuing cleaner energy
technology or building spaceships to extend the human species’s reach, then
so be it. Musk would find a way to make these things happen. “Maybe I
read too many comics as a kid,” Musk said. “In the comics, it always seems
like they are trying to save the world. It seemed like one should try to make
the world a better place because the inverse makes no sense.”
At around age fourteen, Musk had a full-on existential crisis. He tried to
deal with it like many gifted adolescents do, turning to religious and
philosophical texts. Musk sampled a handful of ideologies and then ended
up more or less back where he had started, embracing the sci-fi lessons
found in one of the most influential books in his life: The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. “He points out that one of the
really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once
you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the
conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of
human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.”
The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The
only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective
enlightenment,” he said.
It’s easy enough to spot some of the underpinnings of Musk’s search for
purpose. Born in 1971, he grew up in Pretoria, a large city in the
northeastern part of South Africa, just an hour’s drive from Johannesburg.
The specter of apartheid was present throughout his childhood, as South
Africa frequently boiled over with tension and violence. Blacks and whites
clashed, as did blacks of different tribes. Musk turned four years old just
days after the Soweto Uprising, in which hundreds of black students died
while protesting decrees of the white government. For years South Africa
faced sanctions imposed by other nations due to its racist policies. Musk
had the luxury of traveling abroad during his childhood and would have
gotten a flavor for how outsiders viewed South Africa.
But what had even more of an impact on Musk’s personality was the
white Afrikaner culture so prevalent in Pretoria and the surrounding areas.
Hypermasculine behavior was celebrated and tough jocks were revered.
While Musk enjoyed a level of privilege, he lived as an outsider whose
reserved personality and geeky inclinations ran against the prevailing
attitudes of the time. His notion that something about the world had gone
awry received constant reinforcement, and Musk, almost from his earliest
days, plotted an escape from his surroundings and dreamed of a place that
would allow his personality and dreams to flourish. He saw America in its
most clichéd form, as the land of opportunity and the most likely stage for
making the realization of his dreams possible. This is how it came to pass
that a lonesome, gawky South African boy who talked with the utmost
sincerity about pursuing “collective enlightenment” ended up as America’s
most adventurous industrialist.
When Musk did finally reach the United States in his twenties, it
marked a return to his ancestral roots. Family trees suggest that ancestors
bearing the Swiss German surname of Haldeman on the maternal side of
Musk’s family left Europe for New York during the Revolutionary War.
From New York, they spread out to the prairies of the Midwest—Illinois
and Minnesota, in particular. “We had people that fought on both sides of
the Civil War apparently and were a family of farmers,” said Scott
Haldeman, Musk’s uncle and the unofficial family historian.
Throughout his childhood, boys teased Musk because of his unusual
name. He earned the first part of it from his great-grandfather John Elon
Haldeman, who was born in 18721 and grew up in Illinois before heading to
Minnesota. There he would meet his wife, Almeda Jane Norman, who was
five years younger. By 1902, the couple had settled down in a log cabin in
the central Minnesota town of Pequot and given birth to their son Joshua
Norman Haldeman, Musk’s grandfather. He would grow up to become an
eccentric and exceptional man and a model for Musk.*
Joshua Norman Haldeman is described as an athletic, self-reliant boy. In
1907, his family moved to the prairies of Saskatchewan, and his father died
shortly thereafter when Joshua was just seven, leaving the boy to help run
the house. He took to the wide-open land and picked up bronco horseback
riding, boxing, and wrestling. Haldeman would break in horses for local
farmers, often hurting himself in the process, and he organized one of
Canada’s first rodeos. Family pictures show Joshua dressed in a decorative
pair of chaps demonstrating his rope-spinning skills. As a teenager,
Haldeman left home to get a degree from the Palmer School of Chiropractic
in Iowa and then returned to Saskatchewan to become a farmer.
When the depression hit in the 1930s, Haldeman fell into a financial
crisis. He could not afford to keep up with bank loans on his equipment and
had five thousand acres of land seized. “From then on, Dad didn’t believe in
banks or holding on to money,” said Scott Haldeman, who would go on to
receive his chiropractic degree from the same school as his father and
become one of the world’s top spinal pain experts. After losing the farm
around 1934, Haldeman lived something of a nomadic existence that his
grandson would replicate in Canada decades later. Standing six feet, three
inches, he did odd jobs as a construction worker and rodeo performer before
settling down as a chiropractor.*
By 1948, Haldeman had married a Canadian dance studio instructor,
Winnifred Josephine Fletcher, or Wyn, and built a booming chiropractic
practice. That year, the family, which already included a son and a daughter,
welcomed twin daughters Kaye and Maye, Musk’s mother. The children
lived in a three-story, twenty-room house that included a dance studio to let
Wyn keep teaching students. Ever in search of something new to do,
Haldeman had picked up flying and bought his own plane. The family
gained some measure of notoriety as people heard about Haldeman and his
wife packing their kids into the back of the single-engine craft and heading
off on excursions all around North America. Haldeman would often show
up at political and chiropractic meetings in the plane and later wrote a book
with his wife called The Flying Haldemans: Pity the Poor Private Pilot.
Haldeman seemed to have everything going for him when, in 1950, he
decided to give it all away. The doctor-cum-politician had long railed
against government interference in the lives of individuals and had come to
see the Canadian bureaucracy as too meddlesome. A man who forbade
swearing, smoking, Coca-Cola, and refined flour at his house, Haldeman
contended that the moral character of Canada had started to decline.
Haldeman also possessed an enduring lust for adventure. And so, over the
course of a few months, the family sold their house and dance and
chiropractic practices and decided to move to South Africa—a place
Haldeman had never been. Scott Haldeman remembers helping his father
disassemble the family’s Bellanca Cruisair (1948) airplane and put it into
crates before shipping it to Africa. Once in South Africa, the family rebuilt
the plane and used it to scour the country for a nice place to live, ultimately
settling on Pretoria, where Haldeman set up a new chiropractic practice.
The family’s spirit for adventure seemed to know no bounds. In 1952,
Joshua and Wyn made a 22,000-mile round-trip journey in their plane,
flying up through Africa to Scotland and Norway. Wyn served as the
navigator and, though not a licensed pilot, would sometimes take over the
flying duties. The couple topped this effort in 1954, flying 30,000 miles to
Australia and back. Newspapers reported on the couple’s trip, and they’re
believed to be the only private pilots to get from Africa to Australia in a
single-engine plane.*
When not up in the air, the Haldemans were out in the bush going on
great, monthlong expeditions to find the Lost City of the Kalahari Desert, a
supposed abandoned city in southern Africa. A family photo from one of
these excursions shows the five children in the middle of the African bush.
They have gathered around a large metal pot being warmed by the embers
of a campfire. The children look relaxed as they sit in folding chairs, legs
crossed and reading books. Behind them is the ruby-red Bellanca plane, a
tent, and a car. The tranquility of the scene belies how dangerous these trips
were. During one incident, the family’s truck hit a tree stump and forced the
bumper through the radiator. Stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means
of communication, Joshua worked for three days to fix the truck, while the
family hunted for food. At other times, hyenas and leopards would circle
the campfire at night, and, one morning, the family woke to find a lion three
feet away from their main table. Joshua grabbed the first object he could
find—a lamp—waved it, and told the lion to go away. And it did.*
The Haldemans had a laissez-faire approach to raising their children,
which would extend over the generations to Musk. Their kids were never
punished, as Joshua believed they would intuit their way to proper behavior.
When mom and dad went off on their tremendous flights, the kids were left
at home. Scott Haldeman can’t remember his father setting foot at his
school a single time even though his son was captain of the rugby team and
a prefect. “To him, that was all just anticipated,” said Scott Haldeman. “We
were left with the impression that we were capable of anything. You just
have to make a decision and do it. In that sense, my father would be very
proud of Elon.”
Haldeman died in 1974 at the age of seventy-two. He’d been doing
practice landings in his plane and didn’t see a wire attached to a pair of
poles. The wire caught the plane’s wheels and flipped the craft, and
Haldeman broke his neck. Elon was a toddler at the time. But throughout
his childhood, Elon heard many stories about his grandfather’s exploits and
sat through countless slide shows that documented his travels and trips
through the bush. “My grandmother told these tales of how they almost died
several times along their journeys,” Musk said. “They were flying in a plane
with literally no instruments—not even a radio, and they had road maps
instead of aerial maps, and some of those weren’t even correct. My
grandfather had this desire for adventure, exploration doing crazy things.”
Elon buys into the idea that his unusual tolerance for risk may well have
been inherited directly from his grandfather. Many years after the last slide
show, Elon tried to find and purchase the red Bellanca plane but could not
locate it.
Maye Musk, Elon’s mother, grew up idolizing her parents. In her youth,
she was considered a nerd. She liked math and science and did well at the
coursework. By the age of fifteen, however, people had taken notice of
some of her other attributes. Maye was gorgeous. Tall with ash-blond hair,
Maye had the high cheekbones and angular features that would make her
stand out anywhere. A friend of the family ran a modeling school, and
Maye took some courses. On the weekends, she did runway shows,
magazine shoots, occasionally showed up at a senator’s or ambassador’s
home for an event, and ended up as a finalist for Miss South Africa. (Maye
has continued to model into her sixties, appearing on the covers of
magazines like New York and Elle and in Beyoncé’s music videos.)
Maye and Elon’s father, Errol Musk, grew up in the same neighborhood.
They met for the first time when Maye, born in 1948, was about eleven.
Errol was the cool kid to Maye’s nerd but had a crush on her for years. “He
fell in love with me because of my legs and my teeth,” said Maye. The two
would date on and off throughout their time at university. And, according to
Maye, Errol spent about seven years as a relentless suitor seeking her hand
in marriage and eventually breaking her will. “He just never stopped
proposing,” she said.
Their marriage was complicated from the start. Maye became pregnant
during the couple’s honeymoon and gave birth to Elon on June 28, 1971,
nine months and two days after her wedding day. While they may not have
enjoyed marital bliss, the couple carved out a decent life for themselves in
Pretoria. Errol worked as a mechanical and electrical engineer and handled
large projects such as office buildings, retail complexes, residential
subdivisions, and an air force base, while Maye set up a practice as a
dietician. A bit more than a year after Elon’s birth came his brother Kimbal,
and soon thereafter came their sister Tosca.
Elon exhibited all the traits of a curious, energetic tot. He picked things
up easily, and Maye, like many mothers do, pegged her son as brilliant and
precocious. “He seemed to understand things quicker than the other kids,”
she said. The perplexing thing was that Elon seemed to drift off into a
trance at times. People spoke to him, but nothing got through when he had a
certain, distant look in his eyes. This happened so often that Elon’s parents
and doctors thought he might be deaf. “Sometimes, he just didn’t hear you,”
said Maye. Doctors ran a series of tests on Elon, and elected to remove his
adenoid glands, which can improve hearing in children. “Well, it didn’t
change,” said Maye. Elon’s condition had far more to do with the wiring of
his mind than how his auditory system functioned. “He goes into his brain,
and then you just see he is in another world,” Maye said. “He still does that.
Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or
something.”
Other children did not respond well to these dreamlike states. You could
do jumping jacks right beside Musk or yell at him, and he would not even
notice. He kept right on thinking, and those around him judged that he was
either rude or really weird. “I do think Elon was always a little different but
in a nerdy way,” Maye said. “It didn’t endear him to his peers.”
For Musk, these pensive moments were wonderful. At five and six, he
had found a way to block out the world and dedicate all of his concentration
to a single task. Part of this ability stemmed from the very visual way in
which Musk’s mind worked. He could see images in his mind’s eye with a
clarity and detail that we might associate today with an engineering drawing
produced by computer software. “It seems as though the part of the brain
that’s usually reserved for visual processing—the part that is used to
process images coming in from my eyes—gets taken over by internal
thought processes,” Musk said. “I can’t do this as much now because there
are so many things demanding my attention but, as a kid, it happened a lot.
That large part of your brain that’s used to handle incoming images gets
used for internal thinking.” Computers split their hardest jobs between two
types of chips. There are graphics chips that deal with processing the
images produced by a television show stream or video game and
computational chips that handle general purpose tasks and mathematical
operations. Over time, Musk has ended up thinking that his brain has the
equivalent of a graphics chip. It allows him to see things out in the world,
replicate them in his mind, and imagine how they might change or behave
when interacting with other objects. “For images and numbers, I can
process their interrelationships and algorithmic relationships,” Musk said.
“Acceleration, momentum, kinetic energy—how those sorts of things will
be affected by objects comes through very vividly.”
The most striking part of Elon’s character as a young boy was his
compulsion to read. From a very young age, he seemed to have a book in
his hands at all times. “It was not unusual for him to read ten hours a day,”
said Kimbal. “If it was the weekend, he could go through two books in a
day.” The family went on numerous shopping excursions in which they
realized mid-trip that Elon had gone missing. Maye or Kimbal would pop
into the nearest bookstore and find Elon somewhere near the back sitting on
the floor and reading in one of his trancelike states.
As Elon got older, he would take himself to the bookstore when school
ended at 2 P.M. and stay there until about 6 P.M., when his parents returned
home from work. He plowed through fiction books and then comics and
then nonfiction titles. “Sometimes they kicked me out of the store, but
usually not,” Elon said. He listed The Lord of the Rings, Isaac Asimov’s
Foundation series, and Robert Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress as
some of his favorites, alongside The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. “At
one point, I ran out of books to read at the school library and the
neighborhood library,” Musk said. “This is maybe the third or fourth grade.
I tried to convince the librarian to order books for me. So then, I started to
read the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That was so helpful. You don’t know
what you don’t know. You realize there are all these things out there.”
Elon, in fact, churned through two sets of encyclopedias—a feat that did
little to help him make friends. The boy had a photographic memory, and
the encyclopedias turned him into a fact factory. He came off as a classic
know-it-all. At the dinner table, Tosca would wonder aloud about the
distance from Earth to the Moon. Elon would spit out the exact
measurement at perigee and apogee. “If we had a question, Tosca would
always say, ‘Just ask genius boy,’” Maye said. “We could ask him about
anything. He just remembered it.” Elon cemented his bookworm reputation
through his clumsy ways. “He’s not very sporty,” said Maye.
Maye tells the story of Elon playing outside one night with his siblings
and cousins. When one of them complained of being frightened by the dark,
Elon pointed out that “dark is merely the absence of light,” which did little
to reassure the scared child. As a youngster, Elon’s constant yearning to
correct people and his abrasive manner put off other kids and added to his
feelings of isolation. Elon genuinely thought that people would be happy to
hear about the flaws in their thinking. “Kids don’t like answers like that,”
said Maye. “They would say, ‘Elon, we are not playing with you anymore.’
I felt very sad as a mother because I think he wanted friends. Kimbal and
Tosca would bring home friends, and Elon wouldn’t, and he would want to
play with them. But he was awkward, you know.” Maye urged Kimbal and
Tosca to include Elon. They responded as kids will. “But Mom, he’s not
fun.” As he got older, however, Elon would have strong, affectionate
attachments to his siblings and cousins—his mother’s sister’s sons. Though
he kept to himself at school, Elon had an outgoing nature with members of
his family and eventually took on the role of elder and chief instigator
among them.
For a while, life inside the Musk household was quite good. The family
owned one of the biggest houses in Pretoria thanks to the success of Errol’s
engineering business. There’s a portrait of the three Musk children taken
when Elon was about eight years old that shows three blond, fit children
sitting next to each other on a brick porch with Pretoria’s famous purple
jacaranda trees in the background. Elon has large, rounded cheeks and a
broad smile.
Then, not long after the photo was taken, the family fell apart. His
parents separated and divorced within the year. Maye moved with the kids
to the family’s holiday home in Durban, on South Africa’s eastern coast.
After a couple of years of this arrangement, Elon decided he wanted to live
with his father. “My father seemed sort of sad and lonely, and my mom had
three kids, and he didn’t have any,” Musk said. “It seemed unfair.” Some
members of Musk’s family have bought into this idea that Elon’s logical
nature propelled him, while others claim that his father’s mother, Cora,
exerted a lot of pressure on the boy. “I could not understand why he would
leave this happy home I made for him—this really happy home,” said
Maye. “But Elon is his own person.” Justine Musk, Elon’s ex-wife and the
mother of his five boys, theorized that Elon identified more with the alpha
male of the house and wasn’t bothered by the emotional aspect of the
decision. “I don’t think he was particularly close with either parent,” Justine
said, while describing the Musk clan overall as being cool and the opposite
of doting. Kimbal later opted to live with Errol as well, saying simply that
by nature a son wants to live with his father.
Whenever the topic of Errol arrives, members of Elon’s family clam up.
They’re in agreement that he is not a pleasant man to be around but have
declined to elaborate. Errol has since been remarried, and Elon has two,
younger half sisters of whom he’s quite protective. Elon and his siblings
seem determined not to bad-mouth Errol publicly, so as not to upset the
sisters.
The basics are as follows: Errol’s side of the family has deep South
African roots. The Musk clan can trace its presence in the country back
about two hundred years and claim an entry in Pretoria’s first phone book.
Errol’s father, Walter Henry James Musk, was an army sergeant. “I
remember him almost never talking,” Elon said. “He would just drink
whiskey and be grumpy and was very good at doing crossword puzzles.”
Cora Amelia Musk, Errol’s mother, was born in England to a family famed
for its intellectual genes. She embraced both the spotlight and her
grandchildren. “Our grandmother had this very dominant personality and
was quite an enterprising woman,” said Kimbal. “She was a very big
influence in our lives.” Elon considered his relationship with Cora—or
Nana, as he called her—particularly tight. “After the divorce, she took care
of me quite a lot,” he said. “She would pick me up from school, and I would
hang out with her playing Scrabble and that type of thing.”
On the surface, life at Errol’s house seemed grand. He had plenty of
books for Elon to read from cover to cover and money to buy a computer
and other objects that Elon desired. Errol took his children on numerous
trips overseas. “It was an amazingly fun time,” said Kimbal. “I have a lot of
fun memories from that.” Errol also impressed the kids with his intellect
and dealt out some practical lessons. “He was a talented engineer,” Elon
said. “He knew how every physical object worked.” Both Elon and Kimbal
were required to go to the sites of Errol’s engineering jobs and learn how to
lay bricks, install plumbing, fit windows, and put in electrical wiring.
“There were fun moments,” Elon said.
Errol was what Kimbal described as “ultra-present and very intense.”
He would sit Elon and Kimbal down and lecture at them for three to four
hours without the boys being able to respond. He seemed to delight in being
hard on the boys and sucked the fun out of common childhood diversions.
From time to time, Elon tried to convince his dad to move to America and
often talked about his intentions to live in the United States later in life.
Errol countered such dreams by trying to teach Elon a lesson. He sent the
housekeepers away and had Elon do all the chores to let him know what it
was like “to play American.”
While Elon and Kimbal declined to provide an exact recounting, they
clearly experienced something awful and profound during those years with
their father. They both talk about having to endure some form of
psychological torture. “He definitely has serious chemical stuff,” said
Kimbal. “Which I am sure Elon and I have inherited. It was a very
emotionally challenging upbringing, but it made us who we are today.”
Maye bristled when the subject of Errol came up. “Nobody gets along with
him,” she said. “He is not nice to anyone. I don’t want to tell stories because
they are horrendous. You know, you just don’t talk about it. There are kids
and grandkids involved.”
When asked to chat about Elon, Errol responded via e-mail: “Elon was a
very independent and focused child at home with me. He loved computer
science before anyone even knew what it was in South Africa and his
ability was widely recognized by the time he was 12 years old. Elon and his
brother Kimbal’s activities as children and young men were so many and
varied that it’s difficult to name just one, as they travelled together with me
extensively in S. Africa and the world at large, visiting all the continents
regularly from the age of six onwards. Elon and his brother and sister were
and continue to be exemplary, in every way a father could want. I’m very
proud of what Elon’s accomplished.”
Errol copied Elon on this e-mail, and Elon warned me off corresponding
with his father, insisting that his father’s take on past events could not be
trusted. “He is an odd duck,” Musk said. But, when pressed for more
information, Musk dodged. “It would certainly be accurate to say that I did
not have a good childhood,” he said. “It may sound good. It was not absent
of good, but it was not a happy childhood. It was like misery. He’s good at
making life miserable—that’s for sure. He can take any situation no matter
how good it is and make it bad. He’s not a happy man. I don’t know . . .
fuck . . . I don’t know how someone becomes like he is. It would just cause
too much trouble to tell you any more.” Elon and Justine have vowed that
their children will not be allowed to meet Errol.
When Elon was nearly ten years old, he saw a computer for the first
time, at the Sandton City Mall in Johannesburg. “There was an electronics
store that mostly did hi-fi-type stuff, but then, in one corner, they started
stocking a few computers,” Musk said. He felt awed right away—“It was
like, ‘Whoa. Holy shit!’”—by this machine that could be programmed to do
a person’s bidding. “I had to have that and then hounded my father to get
the computer,” Musk said. Soon he owned a Commodore VIC-20, a popular
home machine that went on sale in 1980. Elon’s computer arrived with five
kilobytes of memory and a workbook on the BASIC programming
language. “It was supposed to take like six months to get through all the
lessons,” Elon said. “I just got super OCD on it and stayed up for three days
with no sleep and did the entire thing. It seemed like the most supercompelling
thing I had ever seen.” Despite being an engineer, Musk’s father
was something of a Luddite and dismissive of the machine. Elon recounted
that “he said it was just for games and that you’d never be able to do real
engineering on it. I just said, ‘Whatever.’”
While bookish and into his new computer, Elon quite often led Kimbal
and his cousins (Kaye’s children) Russ, Lyndon, and Peter Rive on
adventures. They dabbled one year in selling Easter eggs door-to-door in
the neighborhood. The eggs were not well decorated, but the boys still
marked them up a few hundred percent for their wealthy neighbors. Elon
also spearheaded their work with homemade explosives and rockets. South
Africa did not have the Estes rocket kits popular among hobbyists, so Elon
would create his own chemical compounds and put them inside of canisters.
“It is remarkable how many things you can get to explode,” Elon said.
“Saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal are the basic ingredients for gunpowder, and
then if you combine a strong acid with a strong alkaline, that will generally
release a lot of energy. Granulated chlorine with brake fluid—that’s quite
impressive. I’m lucky I have all my fingers.” When not handling
explosives, the boys put on layers of clothing and goggles and shot each
other with pellet guns. Elon and Kimbal raced dirt bikes against each other
in sandlots until Kimbal flew off his bike one day and hurtled into a barbed
wire fence.
As the years went on, the cousins took their entrepreneurial pursuits
more seriously, even attempting at one point to start a video arcade. Without
any parents knowing, the boys picked out a spot for their arcade, got a
lease, and started navigating the permit process for their business.
Eventually, they had to get someone over eighteen to sign a legal document,
and neither the Rives’ father nor Errol would oblige. It would take a couple
of decades, but Elon and the Rives would eventually go into business
together.
The boys’ most audacious exploits may have been their trips between
Pretoria and Johannesburg. During the 1980s, South Africa could be a
terribly violent place, and the thirty-five-mile train trip linking Pretoria and
Johannesburg stood out as one of the world’s more dangerous rides. Kimbal
counted the train journeys as formative experiences for him and Elon.
“South Africa was not a happy-go-lucky place, and that has an impact on
you. We saw some really rough stuff. It was part of an atypical upbringing
—just this insane set of experiences that changes how you view risk. You
don’t grow up thinking getting a job is the hard part. That’s not interesting
enough.”
The boys ranged in age from about thirteen to sixteen and chased a mix
of parties and geeky exploits in Johannesburg. During one jaunt, they went
to a Dungeons & Dragons tournament. “That was us being nerd master
supremes,” Musk said. All of the boys were into the role-playing game,
which requires someone to help set the mood for a contest by imagining and
then describing a scene. “You have entered a room, and there is a chest in
the corner. What will you do? . . . You open the chest. You’ve sprung a trap.
Dozens of goblins are on the loose.” Elon excelled at this Dungeon Master
role and had memorized the texts detailing the powers of monsters and
other characters. “Under Elon’s leadership, we played the role so well and
won the tournament,” said Peter Rive. “Winning requires this incredible
imagination, and Elon really set the tone for keeping people captivated and
inspired.”
The Elon that his peers encountered at school was far less inspirational.
Throughout middle and high school, Elon bounced around a couple of
institutions. He spent the equivalent of eighth and ninth grades at Bryanston
High School. One afternoon Elon and Kimbal were sitting at the top of a
flight of concrete stairs eating when a boy decided to go after Elon. “I was
basically hiding from this gang that was fucking hunting me down for God
knows fucking why. I think I accidentally bumped this guy at assembly that
morning and he’d taken some huge offense at that.” The boy crept up
behind Musk, kicked him in the head, and then shoved him down the stairs.
Musk tumbled down the entire flight, and a handful of boys pounced on
him, some of them kicking Musk in the side and the ringleader bashing his
head against the ground. “They were a bunch of fucking psychos,” Musk
said. “I blacked out.” Kimbal watched in horror and feared for Elon’s life.
He rushed down the stairs to find Elon’s face bloodied and swollen. “He
looked like someone who had just been in the boxing ring,” Kimbal said.
Elon then went to the hospital. “It was about a week before I could get back
to school,” Musk said. (During a news conference in 2013, Elon disclosed
that he’d had a nose job to deal with the lingering effects of this beating.)
For three or four years, Musk endured relentless hounding at the hands
of these bullies. They went so far as to beat up a boy that Musk considered
his best friend until the child agreed to stop hanging out with Musk.
“Moreover, they got him—they got my best fucking friend—to lure me out
of hiding so they could beat me up,” Musk said. “And that fucking hurt.”
While telling this part of the story, Musk’s eyes welled up and his voice
quivered. “For some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were going
to go after me nonstop. That’s what made growing up difficult. For a
number of years, there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at
school who tried to beat the shit out of me, and then I’d come home, and it
would just be awful there as well. It was just like nonstop horrible.”
Musk spent the latter stages of his high school career at Pretoria Boys
High School, where a growth spurt and the generally better behavior of the
students made life more bearable. While a public school by definition,
Pretoria Boys has functioned more like a private school for the last hundred
years. It’s the place you send a young man to get him ready to attend
Oxford or Cambridge.
The boys from Musk’s class remember him as a likable, quiet,
unspectacular student. “There were four or five boys that were considered
the very brightest,” said Deon Prinsloo, who sat behind Elon in some
classes. “Elon was not one of them.” Such comments were echoed by a half
dozen boys who also noted that Musk’s lack of interest in sports left him
isolated in the midst of an athletics-obsessed culture. “Honestly, there were
just no signs that he was going to be a billionaire,” said Gideon Fourie,
another classmate. “He was never in a leadership position at school. I was
rather surprised to see what has happened to him.”
While Musk didn’t have any close friends at school, his eccentric
interests did leave an impression. One boy—Ted Wood—remembered
Musk bringing model rockets to school and blasting them off during breaks.
This was not the only hint of his aspirations. During a science-class debate,
Elon gained attention for railing against fossil fuels in favor of solar power
—an almost sacrilegious stance in a country devoted to mining the earth’s
natural resources. “He always had firm views on things,” said Wood.
Terency Beney, a classmate who stayed in touch with Elon over the years,
claimed that Musk had started fantasizing about colonizing other planets in
high school as well.
In another nod to the future, Elon and Kimbal were chatting during a
class break outdoors when Wood interrupted them and asked what they
were going on about. “They said, ‘We are talking about whether there is a
need for branch banking in the financial industry and whether we will move
to paperless banking.’ I remember thinking that was such an absurd
comment to make. I said, ‘Yeah, that’s great.’”*
While Musk might not have been among the academic elite in his class,
he was among a handful of students with the grades and self-professed
interest to be selected for an experimental computer program. Students were
plucked out of a number of schools and brought together to learn the
BASIC, COBOL, and Pascal programming languages. Musk continued to
augment these technological leanings with his love of science fiction and
fantasy and tried his hand at writing stories that involved dragons and
supernatural beings. “I wanted to write something like Lord of the Rings,”
he said.
Maye viewed these high school years through a mother’s eyes and
recounted plenty of tales of Musk performing spectacular academic feats.
The video game he wrote, she said, impressed much older, more
experienced techies. He aced math exams well beyond his years. And he
had that incredible memory. The only reason he did not outrank the other
boys was a lack of interest in the work prescribed by the school.
As Musk saw it, “I just look at it as ‘What grades do I need to get where
I want to go?’ There were compulsory subjects like Afrikaans, and I just
didn’t see the point of learning that. It seemed ridiculous. I’d get a passing
grade and that was fine. Things like physics and computers—I got the
highest grade you can get in those. There needs to be a reason for a grade.
I’d rather play video games, write software, and read books than try and get
an A if there’s no point in getting an A. I can remember failing subjects in
like fourth and fifth grade. Then, my mother’s boyfriend told me I’d be held
back if I didn’t pass. I didn’t actually know you had to pass the subjects to
move to the next grade. I got the best grades in class after that.”
At seventeen, Musk left South Africa for Canada. He has recounted this
journey quite often in the press and typically leans on two descriptions of
the motivation for his flight. The short version is that Musk wanted to get to
the United States as quickly as possible and could use Canada as a pit stop
via his Canadian ancestry. The second go-to story that Musk relies on has
more of a social conscience. South Africa required military service at the
time. Musk wanted to avoid joining the military, he has said, because it
would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime.
What rarely gets mentioned is that Musk attended the University of
Pretoria for five months before heading off on his grand adventure. He
began pursuing physics and engineering but put lackluster effort into the
work and soon dropped out of school. Musk characterized the time at
university as just something to do while he awaited his Canadian
documentation. In addition to being an inconsequential part of his life,
Musk lazing through school to avoid South Africa’s required military
service rather undermines the tale of a brooding, adventurous youth that he
likes to tell, which is likely why the stint at the University of Pretoria never
seems to come up.
There’s no question, though, that Musk had been pining to get to the
United States on a visceral level for a long time. Musk’s early inclination
toward computers and technology had fostered an intense interest in Silicon
Valley, and his trips overseas had reinforced the idea that America was the
place to get things done. South Africa, by contrast, presented far less
opportunity for an entrepreneurial soul. As Kimbal put it, “South Africa
was like a prison for someone like Elon.”
Musk’s opportunity to flee arrived with a change in the law that allowed
Maye to pass her Canadian citizenship to her children. Musk immediately
began researching how to complete the paperwork for this process. It took
about a year to receive the approvals from the Canadian government and to
secure a Canadian passport. “That’s when Elon said, ‘I’m leaving for
Canada,’” Maye said. In these pre-Internet days, Musk had to wait three
agonizing weeks to get a plane ticket. Once it arrived, and without
flinching, he left home for good.

CANADA
MUSK’S GREAT ESCAPE TO CANADA WAS NOT WELL
THOUGHT OUT. He knew of a great-uncle in Montreal, hopped on a flight
and hoped for the best. Upon landing in June 1988, Musk found a pay
phone and tried to use directory assistance to find his uncle. When that
didn’t work, he called his mother collect. She had bad news. Maye had sent
a letter to the uncle before Musk left and received a reply while her son was
in transit. The uncle had gone to Minnesota, meaning Musk had nowhere to
stay. Bags in hand, Musk headed for a youth hostel.
After spending a few days in Montreal exploring the city, Musk tried to
come up with a long-term plan. Maye had family scattered all across
Canada, and Musk began reaching out to them. He bought a countrywide
bus ticket that let him hop on and off as he pleased for one hundred dollars,
and opted to head to Saskatchewan, the former home of his grandfather.
After a 1,900-mile bus ride, he ended up in Swift Current, a town of fifteen
thousand people. Musk called a second cousin out of the blue from the bus
station and hitched a ride to his house.
Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada.
He tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin’s farm located
in the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there,
sharing a cake with the family he’d just met and a few strangers from the
neighborhood. After that, he learned to cut logs with a chain saw in
Vancouver, British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after a visit
to the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the best wage,
which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill for
eighteen dollars an hour. “You have to put on this hazmat suit and then
shimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in,” Musk said.
“Then, you have a shovel and you take the sand and goop and other residue,
which is still steaming hot, and you have to shovel it through the same hole
you came through. There is no escape. Someone else on the other side has
to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you stay in there for more than thirty
minutes, you get too hot and die.” Thirty people started out at the beginning
of the week. By the third day, five people were left. At the end of the week,
it was just Musk and two other men doing the work.
As Musk made his way around Canada, his brother, sister, and mother
were figuring out how to get there as well.* When Kimbal and Elon
eventually reunited in Canada, their headstrong, playful natures bloomed.
Elon ended up enrolling at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, in
1989. (He picked Queen’s over the University of Waterloo because he felt
there were more good-looking women at Queen’s.)2 Outside of his studies,
Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal, and the two of them
would identify interesting people they would like to meet. They then took
turns cold-calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch.
Among the harassed was the head of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays
baseball team, a business writer for the Globe and Mail, and a top executive
at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Peter Nicholson. Nicholson remembered the
boys’ call well. “I was not in the habit of getting out-of-the-blue requests,”
he said. “I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that
had that kind of gumption.” It took six months to get on Nicholson’s
calendar, but, sure enough, the Musk brothers made a three-hour train ride
and showed up on time.
Nicholson’s first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an
impression many would share. Both presented themselves well and were
polite. Elon, though, clearly came off as the geekier, more awkward
counterpoint to the charismatic, personable Kimbal. “I became more
impressed and fascinated as I talked to them,” Nicholson said. “They were
so determined.” Nicholson ended up offering Elon a summer internship at
the bank and became his trusted advisor.
Not long after their initial meeting, Elon invited Peter Nicholson’s
daughter Christie to his birthday party. Christie showed up at Maye’s
Toronto apartment with a jar of homemade lemon curd in hand and was
greeted by Elon and about fifteen other people. Elon had never met Christie
before, but he went right up to her and led her to a couch. “Then, I believe
the second sentence out of his mouth was ‘I think a lot about electric cars,’”
Christie said. “And then he turned to me and said, ‘Do you think about
electric cars?’” The conversation left Christie, who is now a science writer,
with the distinct impression that Musk was handsome, affable, and a
tremendous nerd. “For whatever reason, I was so struck by that moment on
the sofa,” she said. “You could tell that this person was very different. He
captivated me in that way.”
With her angular features and blond hair, Christie fit Musk’s type, and
the two stayed in touch during Musk’s time in Canada. They never really
dated, but Christie found Musk interesting enough to have lengthy
conversations with him on the phone. “One night he told me, ‘If there was a
way that I could not eat, so I could work more, I would not eat. I wish there
was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.’ The enormity
of his work ethic at that age and his intensity jumped out. It seemed like one
of the more unusual things I had ever heard.”
A deeper relationship during this stint in Canada arose between Musk
and Justine Wilson, a fellow student at Queen’s. Leggy with long, brown
hair, Wilson radiated romance and sexual energy. Justine had already fallen
in love with an older man and then ditched him to go to college. Her next
conquest was meant to wear a leather jacket and be a damaged, James Dean
sort. As fortune would have it, however, the clean-cut, posh-sounding Musk
spotted Wilson on campus and went right to work trying to date her. “She
looked pretty great,” Musk said. “She was also smart and this intellectual
with sort of an edge. She had a black belt in tae kwon do and was semibohemian
and, you know, like the hot chick on campus.” He made his first
move just outside of her dorm, where he pretended to have bumped into her
by accident and then reminded her that they had met previously at a party.
Justine, only one week into school, agreed to Musk’s proposal of an ice
cream date. When he arrived to pick up Wilson, Musk found a note on the
dorm room door, notifying him that he’d been stood up. “It said that she had
to go study for an exam and couldn’t make it and that she was sorry,” Musk
said. Musk then hunted down Justine’s best friend and did some research,
asking where Justine usually studied and what her favorite flavor of ice
cream was. Later, as Justine hid in the student center studying Spanish,
Musk appeared behind her with a couple of melting chocolate chip ice
cream cones in hand.
Wilson had dreamed of having a torrid romance with a writer. “I wanted
to be Sylvia and Ted,” she said. What she fell for instead was a relentless,
ambitious geek. The pair attended the same abnormal-psychology class and
compared their grades following an exam. Justine notched a 97, Musk a 98.
“He went back to the professor, and talked his way into the two points he
lost and got a hundred,” Justine said. “It felt like we were always
competing.” Musk had a romantic side as well. One time he sent Wilson a
dozen roses, each with its own note, and he also gifted Wilson a copy of
The Prophet filled with handwritten romantic musings. “He can sweep you
off your feet,” Justine said.
During their university years, the two youngsters were off and on, with
Musk having to work hard to keep the relationship going. “She was hip and
dated the coolest guys and wasn’t interested in Elon at all,” Maye said. “So
that was hard on him.” Musk pursued a couple of other girls, but kept
returning to Justine. Any time she acted cool toward him, Musk responded
with his usual show of force. “He would call very insistently,” she said.
“You always knew it was Elon because the phone would never stop ringing.
The man does not take no for an answer. You can’t blow him off. I do think
of him as the Terminator. He locks his gaze on to something and says, ‘It
shall be mine.’ Bit by bit, he won me over.”
College suited Musk. He worked on being less of a know-it-all, while
also finding a group of people who respected his intellectual abilities. The
university students were less inclined to laugh off or deride his opinionated
takes on energy, space, and whatever else was captivating him at the
moment. Musk had found people who responded to his ambition rather than
mocking it, and he fed on this environment.
Navaid Farooq, a Canadian who grew up in Geneva, ended up in
Musk’s freshman-year dormitory in the fall of 1990. Both men were placed
in the international section where a Canadian student would get paired with
a student from overseas. Musk sort of broke the system, since he technically
counted as a Canadian but knew almost nothing about his surroundings. “I
had a roommate from Hong Kong, and he was a really nice guy,” Musk
said. “He religiously attended every lecture, which was helpful, since I went
to the least number of classes possible.” For a time, Musk sold computer
parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. “I could build
something to suit their needs like a tricked-out gaming machine or a simple
word processor that cost less than what they could get in a store,” Musk
said. “Or if their computer didn’t boot properly or had a virus, I’d fix it. I
could pretty much solve any problem.” Farooq and Musk bonded over their
backgrounds living abroad and a shared interest in strategy board games. “I
don’t think he makes friends easily, but he is very loyal to those he has,”
Farooq said. When the video game Civilization was released, the college
chums spent hours building their empire, much to the dismay of Farooq’s
girlfriend, who was forgotten in another room. “Elon could lose himself for
hours on end,” Farooq said. The students also relished their loner lifestyles.
“We are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not feel
awkward,” Farooq said. “We can think to ourselves and not feel socially
weird about it.”
Musk was more ambitious in college than he’d been in high school. He
studied business, competed in public speaking contests, and began to
display the brand of intensity and competitiveness that marks his behavior
today. After one economics exam, Musk, Farooq, and some other students
in class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to
ascertain how well they did on the test. It soon became clear that Musk had
a firmer grasp on the material than anyone else. “This was a group of fairly
high achievers, and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve,” Farooq said.
Musk’s intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship.
“When Elon gets into something, he develops just this different level of
interest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon from the rest
of humanity.”
In 1992, having spent two years at Queen’s, Musk transferred to the
University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship. Musk saw the Ivy League
school as possibly opening some additional doors and went off in pursuit of
dual degrees—first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then
a bachelor’s degree in physics. Justine stayed at Queen’s, pursuing her
dream of becoming a writer, and maintained a long-distance relationship
with Musk. Now and again, she would visit him, and the two would
sometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend.
Musk blossomed even more at Penn, and really started to feel
comfortable while hanging out with his fellow physics students. “At Penn,
he met people that thought like him,” Maye said. “There were some nerds
there. He so enjoyed them. I remember going for lunch with them, and they
were talking physics things. They were saying, ‘A plus B equals pi squared’
or whatever. They would laugh out loud. It was cool to see him so happy.”
Once again, however, Musk did not make many friends among the broader
school body. It’s difficult to find former students who remember him being
there at all. But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi, who
would go on to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur in his own right and is to
this day as tight with Elon as anyone.
Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air.
He was the artistic, colorful foil to the studious, more buttoned-up Musk.
Both of the young men were transfer students and ended up being placed in
the funky freshman dorm. The lackluster social scene did not live up to
Ressi’s expectations, and he talked Musk into renting a large house off
campus. They got the ten-bedroom home relatively cheap, since it was a frat
house that had gone unrented. During the week, Musk and Ressi would
study, but as the weekend approached, Ressi, in particular, would transform
the house into a nightclub. He covered the windows with trash bags to make
it pitch black inside and decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever
objects he could find. “It was a full-out, unlicensed speakeasy,” Ressi said.
“We would have as many as five hundred people. We would charge five
dollars, and it would be pretty much all you could drink—beer and Jell-O
shots and other things.”
Come Friday night, the ground around the house would shake from the
intensity of the bass being pumped out by Ressi’s speakers. Maye visited
one of the parties and discovered that Ressi had hammered objects into the
walls and lacquered them with glow-in-the-dark paint. She ended up
working the door as the coat check/money taker and grabbed a pair of
scissors for protection as the cash piled up in a shoe box.
A second house had fourteen rooms. Musk, Ressi, and one other person
lived there. They fashioned tables by laying plywood on top of used kegs
and came up with other makeshift furniture ideas. Musk returned home one
day to find that Ressi had nailed his desk to the wall and then painted it in
Day-Glo colors. Musk retaliated by pulling his desk down, painting it black,
and studying. “I’m like, ‘Dude, that’s installation art in our party house,’”
said Ressi. Remind Musk of this incident and he’ll respond matter-of-factly,
“It was a desk.”
Musk will have the occasional vodka and Diet Coke, but he’s not a big
drinker and does not really care for the taste of alcohol. “Somebody had to
stay sober during these parties,” Musk said. “I was paying my own way
through college and could make an entire month’s rent in one night. Adeo
was in charge of doing cool shit around the house, and I would run the
party.” As Ressi put it, “Elon was the most straight-laced dude you have
ever met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally nothing.”
The only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk’s behavior came
during video game binges that could go on for days.
Musk’s longtime interest in solar power and in finding other new ways
to harness energy expanded at Penn. In December 1994, he had to come up
with a business plan for one of his classes and ended up writing a paper
titled “The Importance of Being Solar.” The document started with a bit of
Musk’s wry sense of humor. At the top of the page, he wrote: “The sun will
come out tomorrow. . . .”—Little Orphan Annie on the subject of renewable
energy. The paper went on to predict a rise in solar power technology based
on materials improvements and the construction of large-scale solar plants.
Musk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds
that can make them more efficient. He concluded the paper with a drawing
of the “power station of the future.” It depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in
space—each four kilometers in width—sending their juice down to Earth
via microwave beams to a receiving antenna with a seven-kilometer
diameter. Musk received a 98 on what his professor deemed a “very
interesting and well written paper.”
A second paper talked about taking research documents and books and
electronically scanning them, performing optical character recognition, and
putting all of the information in a single database—much like a mix
between today’s Google Books and Google Scholar. And a third paper
dwelled on another of Musk’s favorite topics—ultracapacitors. In the fortyfour-
page document, Musk is plainly jubilant over the idea of a new form of
energy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars, planes, and
rockets. Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley,
he wrote: “The end result represents the first new means of storing
significant amounts of electrical energy since the development of the
battery and fuel cell. Furthermore, because the Ultracapacitor retains the
basic properties of a capacitor, it can deliver its energy over one hundred
times faster than a battery of equivalent weight, and be recharged just as
quickly.” Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise for “a very thorough
analysis” with “excellent financials!”
The remarks from the professor were spot-on. Musk’s clear, concise
writing is the work of a logician, moving from one point to the next with
precision. What truly stood out, though, was Musk’s ability to master
difficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans. Even then,
he showed an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a
scientific advance to a for-profit enterprise.
As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after
college, he briefly considered getting into the videogame business. He’d
been obsessed with video games since his childhood and had held a gaming
internship. But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a pursuit. “I
really like computer games, but then if I made really great computer games,
how much effect would that have on the world,” he said. “It wouldn’t have
a big effect. Even though I have an intrinsic love of video games, I couldn’t
bring myself to do that as a career.”
In interviews, Musk often makes sure that people know he had some
truly big ideas on his mind during this period of his life. As he tells it, he
would daydream at Queen’s and Penn and usually end up with the same
conclusion: he viewed the Internet, renewable energy, and space as the three
areas that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the
markets where he could make a big impact. He vowed to pursue projects in
all three. “I told all my ex-girlfriends and my ex-wife about these ideas,” he
said. “It probably sounded like super-crazy talk.”
Musk’s insistence on explaining the early origins of his passion for
electric cars, solar energy, and rockets can come off as insecure. It feels as if
Musk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way. But for Musk, the
distinction between stumbling into something and having intent is
important. Musk has long wanted the world to know that he’s different from
the run-of-the-mill entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. He wasn’t just sniffing
out trends, and he wasn’t consumed by the idea of getting rich. He’s been in
pursuit of a master plan all along. “I really was thinking about this stuff in
college,” he said. “It is not some invented story after the fact. I don’t want
to seem like a Johnny-come-lately or that I’m chasing a fad or just being
opportunistic. I’m not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I
think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way.”

ELON’S FIRST START-UP
IN THE SUMMER OF 1994, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, took their
first steps toward becoming honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a
road trip across the country.
Kimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and
done well for himself, running what amounted to a small business. He sold
off his part of the franchise and pooled the money with what Musk had on
hand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near
San Francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part
of the drive took them down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There
they experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree weather in a car with no
air-conditioning and learned to love pit stops at Carl’s Jr. burger joints,
where they spent hours recuperating in the cold.
The trip provided plenty of time for your typical twenty-something
hijinks and raging capitalist daydreaming. The Web had just started to
become accessible to the public thanks to the rise of directory sites like
Yahoo! and tools like Netscape’s browser. The brothers were tuned in to the
Internet and thought they might like to start a company together doing
something on the Web. From California to Colorado, Wyoming, South
Dakota, and Illinois, they took turns driving, brainstorming, and talking shit
before heading back east to get Musk to school that fall. The best idea to
arise from the journey was an online network for doctors. This wasn’t
meant to be something as ambitious as electronic health records but more of
a system for physicians to exchange information and collaborate. “It
seemed like the medical industry was one that could be disrupted,” Kimbal
said. “I went to work on a business plan and the sales and marketing side of
it later, but it didn’t fly. We didn’t love it.”
Musk had spent the earlier part of that summer in Silicon Valley,
holding down a pair of internships. By day, he worked at Pinnacle Research
Institute. Based in Los Gatos, Pinnacle was a much-ballyhooed start-up
with a team of scientists exploring ways in which ultracapacitors could be
used as a revolutionary fuel source in electric and hybrid vehicles. The
work also veered—at least conceptually—into more bizarre territory. Musk
could talk at length about how ultracapacitors might be used to build laserbased
sidearms in the tradition of Star Wars and just about any other
futuristic film. The laser guns would release rounds of enormous energy,
and then the shooter would replace an ultracapacitor at the base of the gun,
much like swapping out a clip of bullets, and start blasting away again.
Ultracapacitors also looked promising as the power supplies for missiles.
They were more resilient than batteries under the mechanical stresses of a
launch and would hold a more consistent charge over long periods of time.
Musk fell in love with the work at Pinnacle and began using it as the basis
for some of his business plan experiments at Penn and for his industrialist
fantasies.
In the evenings, Musk headed to Rocket Science Games, a start-up
based in Palo Alto that wanted to create the most advanced video games
ever made by moving them off cartridges and onto CDs that could hold
more information. The CDs would in theory allow them to bring
Hollywood-style storytelling and production quality to the games. A team
of budding all-stars who were a mix of engineers and film people was
assembled to pull off the work. Tony Fadell, who would later drive much of
the development of both the iPod and iPhone at Apple, worked at Rocket
Science, as did the guys who developed the QuickTime multimedia
software for Apple. They also had people who worked on the original Star
Wars effects at Industrial Light & Magic and some who did games at
LucasArts Entertainment. Rocket Science gave Musk a flavor for what
Silicon Valley had to offer both from a talent and culture perspective. There
were people working at the office twenty-four hours a day, and they didn’t
think it at all odd that Musk would turn up around 5 P.M. every evening to
start his second job. “We brought him in to write some very menial lowlevel
code,” said Peter Barrett, an Australian engineer who helped start the
company. “He was completely unflappable. After a short while, I don’t
think anyone was giving him any direction, and he ended up making what
he wanted to make.”
Specifically, Musk had been asked to write the drivers that would let
joysticks and mice communicate with various computers and games.
Drivers are the same types of annoying files that you have to install to get a
printer or camera working with a home computer—true grunt work. A selftaught
programmer, Musk fancied himself quite good at coding and
assigned himself to more ambitious jobs. “I was basically trying to figure
out how you could multitask stuff, so you could read video from a CD,
while running a game at the same time,” Musk said. “At the time, you could
do one or the other. It was this complicated bit of assembly programming.”
Complicated indeed. Musk had to issue commands that spoke directly to a
computer’s main microprocessor and fiddled with the most basic functions
that made the machine work. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind
Apple’s QuickTime, had overseen the hiring of Musk and marveled at his
ability to pull all-nighters. “He had boundless energy,” Leak said. “Kids
these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC
hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.”
Musk found in Silicon Valley a wealth of the opportunity he’d been
seeking and a place equal to his ambitions. He would return two summers in
a row and then bolt west permanently after graduating with dual degrees
from Penn. He initially intended to pursue a doctorate in materials science
and physics at Stanford and to advance the work he’d done at Pinnacle on
ultracapacitors. As the story goes, Musk dropped out of Stanford after two
days, finding the Internet’s call irresistible. He talked Kimbal into moving
to Silicon Valley as well, so they could conquer the Web together.
The first inklings of a viable Internet business had come to Musk during
his internships. A salesperson from the Yellow Pages had come into one of
the start-up offices. He tried to sell the idea of an online listing to
complement the regular listing a company would have in the big, fat Yellow
Pages book. The salesman struggled with his pitch and clearly had little
grasp of what the Internet actually was or how someone would find a
business on it. The flimsy pitch got Musk thinking, and he reached out to
Kimbal, talking up the idea of helping businesses get online for the first
time.
“Elon said, ‘These guys don’t know what they are talking about. Maybe
this is something we can do,’” Kimbal said. This was 1995, and the brothers
were about to form Global Link Information Network, a start-up that would
eventually be renamed Zip2. (For details on the controversy surrounding
Zip2’s founding and Musk’s academic record, see Appendix 1.)
The Zip2 idea was ingenious. Few small businesses in 1995 understood
the ramifications of the Internet. They had little idea how to get on it and
didn’t really see the value in creating a website for their business or even in
having a Yellow Pages–like listing online. Musk and his brother hoped to
convince restaurants, clothing shops, hairdressers, and the like that the time
had come for them to make their presence known to the Web-surfing public.
Zip2 would create a searchable directory of businesses and tie this into
maps. Musk often explained the concept through pizza, saying that
everyone deserved the right to know the location of their closest pizza
parlor and the turn-by-turn directions to get there. This may seem obvious
today—think Yelp meets Google Maps—but back then, not even stoners
had dreamed up such a service.
The Musk brothers brought Zip2 to life at 430 Sherman Avenue in Palo
Alto. They rented a studio-apartment-sized office—twenty feet by thirty
feet—and acquired some basic furniture. The three-story building had its
quirks. There were no elevators, and the toilets often backed up. “It was
literally a shitty place to work,” said an early employee. To get a fast
Internet connection, Musk struck a deal with Ray Girouard, an entrepreneur
who ran an Internet service provider operation from the floor below the
Zip2 offices. According to Girouard, Musk drilled a hole in the drywall near
the Zip2 door and then strung an Ethernet cable down the stairwell to the
ISP. “They were slow to pay a couple of times but never stiffed me on the
bill,” Girouard said.
Musk did all of the original coding behind the service himself, while the
more amiable Kimbal looked to ramp up the door-to-door sales operation.
Musk had acquired a cheap license to a database of business listings in the
Bay Area that would give a business’s name and its address. He then
contacted Navteq, a company that had spent hundreds of millions of dollars
to create digital maps and directions that could be used in early GPS
navigation-style devices, and struck a masterful bargain. “We called them
up, and they gave us the technology for free,” said Kimbal. Musk merged
the two databases together to get a rudimentary system up and running.
Over time, Zip2’s engineers had to augment this initial data haul with more
maps to cover areas outside of major metropolitan areas and to build custom
turn-by-turn directions that would look good and work well on a home
computer.
Errol Musk gave his sons $28,000 to help them through this period, but
they were more or less broke after getting the office space, licensing
software, and buying some equipment. For the first three months of Zip2’s
life, Musk and his brother lived at the office. They had a small closet where
they kept their clothes and would shower at the YMCA. “Sometimes we ate
four meals a day at Jack in the Box,” Kimbal said. “It was open twenty-four
hours, which suited our work schedule. I got a smoothie one time, and there
was something in it. I just pulled it out and kept drinking. I haven’t been
able to eat there since, but I can still recite their menu.”
Next, the brothers rented a two-bedroom apartment. They didn’t have
the money or the inclination to get furniture. So there were just a couple of
mattresses on the floor. Musk somehow managed to convince a young
South Korean engineer to come work at Zip2 as an intern in exchange for
room and board. “This poor kid thought he was coming over for a job at a
big company,” Kimbal said. “He ended up living with us and had no idea
what he was getting into.” One day, the intern drove the Musks’ battered
BMW 320i to work, and a wheel came off en route. The axle dug into the
street at the intersection of Page Mill Road and El Camino Real, and the
groove it carved out remained visible for years.
Zip2 may have been a go-go Internet enterprise aimed at the
Information Age, but getting it off the ground required old-fashioned doorto-
door salesmanship. Businesses needed to be persuaded of the Web’s
benefits and charmed into paying for the unknown. In late 1995, the Musk
brothers began making their first hires and assembling a motley sales team.
Jeff Heilman, a free-spirited twenty-year-old trying to figure out what to do
with his life, arrived as one of Zip2’s first recruits. He’d been watching TV
late one night with his dad and seen a Web address printed at the bottom of
the screen during a commercial. “It was for something dot-com,” Heilman
said. “I remember sitting there and asking my dad what we were looking at.
He said he didn’t know, either. That’s when I realized I had to go find me
some Internet.” Heilman spent a couple of weeks trying to chat up people
who could explain the Internet to him and then stumbled on a two-by-twoinch
Zip2 job listing in the San Jose Mercury News. “Internet Sales Apply
Here!” it read, and Heilman got the gig. A handful of other salespeople
joined him and worked for commissions.
Musk never seemed to leave the office. He slept, not unlike a dog, on a
beanbag next to his desk. “Almost every day, I’d come in at seven thirty or
eight A.M., and he’d be asleep right there on that bag,” Heilman said.
“Maybe he showered on the weekends. I don’t know.” Musk asked those
first employees of Zip2 to give him a kick when they arrived, and he’d
wake up and get back to work. While Musk did his possessed coder thing,
Kimbal became the rah-rah sales leader. “Kimbal was the eternal optimist,
and he was very, very uplifting,” Heilman said. “I had never met anyone
quite like him.” Kimbal sent Heilman to the high-end Stanford shopping
mall and to University Avenue, the main drag in Palo Alto, to coax retailers
into signing up with Zip2, explaining that a sponsored listing would send a
company to the top of search results. The big problem, of course, was that
no one was buying. Week after week, Heilman knocked on doors and
returned to the office with very little to report in the way of good news. The
nicest responses came from the people who told Heilman that advertising
on the Internet sounded like the dumbest thing they had ever heard of. Most
often, the shop owners just told Heilman to leave and stop bothering them.
When lunchtime came around, the Musks would reach into a cigar box
where they kept some cash, take Heilman out, and get the depressing status
reports on the sales.
Craig Mohr, another early employee, gave up his job selling real estate
to hawk Zip2’s service. He decided to court auto dealerships because they
usually spent lots of money on advertising. He told them about Zip2’s main
website—www.totalinfo.com—and tried to convince them that demand was
high to get a listing like www.totalinfo.com/toyotaofsiliconvalley. The
service did not always work when Mohr demonstrated it or it would load
very slowly, as was common back then. This forced him to talk the
customers into imagining Zip2’s potential. “One day I came back with
about nine hundred dollars in checks,” Mohr said. “I walked into the office
and asked the guys what they wanted me to do with the money. Elon
stopped pounding his keyboard, leaned out from behind his monitor, and
said, ‘No way, you’ve got money.’”
What kept the employees’ spirits up were the continuous improvements
Musk made with the Zip2 software. The service had morphed from a proofof-
concept to an actual product that could be used and demoed. Ever
marketing savvy, the Musk brothers tried to make their Web service seem
more important by giving it an imposing physical body. Musk built a huge
case around a standard PC and lugged the unit onto a base with wheels.
When prospective investors would come by, Musk would put on a show and
roll this massive machine out so that it appeared like Zip2 ran inside of a
mini-supercomputer. “The investors thought that was impressive,” Kimbal
said. Heilman also noticed that the investors bought into Musk’s slavish
devotion to the company. “Even then, as essentially a college kid with zits,
Elon had this drive that this thing—whatever it was—had to get done and
that if he didn’t do it, he’d miss his shot,” Heilman said. “I think that’s what
the VCs saw—that he was willing to stake his existence on building out this
platform.” Musk actually said as much to one venture capitalist, informing
him, “My mentality is that of a samurai. I would rather commit seppuku
than fail.”
Early on in the Zip2 venture, Musk acquired an important confidant,
who tempered some of these more dramatic impulses. Greg Kouri, a
Canadian businessman in his mid-thirties, had met the Musks in Toronto
and bought into the early Zip2 brainstorming. The boys had showed up at
his door one morning to inform Kouri that they intended to head to
California to give the business a shot. Still in his red bathrobe, Kouri went
back into the house, dug around for a couple of minutes, and came back
with a wad of $6,000. In early 1996, he moved to California and joined
Zip2 as a cofounder.
Kouri, who had done a number of real estate deals in the past and had
actual business experience and skills at reading people, served as the adult
supervision at Zip2. The Canadian had a knack for calming Musk and
ended up becoming something of a mentor. “Really smart people sometimes
don’t understand that not everyone can keep up with them or go as fast,”
said Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist who would become Zip2’s chief
executive officer. “Greg is one of the few people that Elon would listen to
and had a way of putting things in context for him.” Kouri also used to
referee fistfights between Elon and Kimbal, in the middle of the office.
“I don’t get in fights with anyone else, but Elon and I don’t have the
ability to reconcile a vision other than our own,” Kimbal said. During a
particularly nasty scrap over a business decision, Elon ripped some skin off
his fist and had to go get a tetanus shot. Kouri put an end to the fights after
that. (Kouri died of a heart attack in 2012 at the age of fifty-one, having
made a fortune investing in Musk’s companies. Musk attended his funeral.
“We owe him a lot,” said Kimbal.)
In early 1996, Zip2 underwent a massive change. The venture capital
firm Mohr Davidow Ventures had caught wind of a couple of South African
boys trying to make a Yellow Pages for the Internet and met with the
brothers. Musk, while raw in his presentation skills, pitched the company
well enough, and the investors came away impressed with his energy. Mohr
Davidow invested $3 million into the company.* With these funds in hand,
the company officially changed its name from Global Link to Zip2—the
idea being zip to here, zip to there—moved to a larger office at 390
Cambridge Avenue in Palo Alto, and began hiring talented engineers. Zip2
also shifted its business strategy. At the time, the company had built one of
the best direction systems on the Web. Zip2 would advance this technology
and take it from focusing just on the Bay Area to having a national scope.
The company’s main focus, however, would be an altogether new play.
Instead of selling its service door-to-door, Zip2 would create a software
package that could be sold to newspapers, which would in turn build their
own directories for real estate, auto dealers, and classifieds. The newspapers
were late understanding how the Internet would impact their businesses,
and Zip2’s software would give them a quick way of getting online without
needing to develop all their own technology from scratch. For its part, Zip2
could chase bigger prey and get a cut of a nationwide network of listings.
This transition of the business model and the company’s makeup would
be a seminal moment in Musk’s life. The venture capitalists pushed Musk
into the role of chief technology officer and hired Rich Sorkin as the
company’s CEO. Sorkin had worked at Creative Labs, a maker of audio
equipment, and run the business development group at the company, where
he steered a number of investments in Internet start-ups. Zip2’s investors
saw him as experienced and clued in to the Web. While Musk agreed to the
arrangement, he came to resent giving up control of Zip2. “Probably the
biggest regret the whole time I worked with him was that he had made a
deal with the devil with Mohr Davidow,” said Jim Ambras, the vice
president of engineering at Zip2. “Elon didn’t have any operational
responsibilities, and he wanted to be CEO.”
Ambras had worked at Hewlett-Packard Labs and Silicon Graphics Inc.
and exemplified the high-caliber talent Zip2 brought on after the first wave
of money arrived. Silicon Graphics, a maker of high-end computers beloved
by Hollywood, was the flashiest company of its day and had hoarded the
elite geeks of Silicon Valley. And yet Ambras used the promise of Internet
riches to poach a team of SGI’s smartest engineers over to Zip2. “Our
attorneys got a letter from SGI saying that we were cherry-picking the very
best guys,” Ambras said. “Elon thought that was fantastic.”
While Musk had exceled as a self-taught coder, his skills weren’t nearly
as polished as those of the new hires. They took one look at Zip2’s code and
began rewriting the vast majority of the software. Musk bristled at some of
their changes, but the computer scientists needed just a fraction of the lines
of code that Musk used to get their jobs done. They had a knack for
dividing software projects into chunks that could be altered and refined
whereas Musk fell into the classic self-taught coder trap of writing what
developers call hairballs—big, monolithic hunks of code that could go
berserk for mysterious reasons. The engineers also brought a more refined
working structure and realistic deadlines to the engineering group. This was
a welcome change from Musk’s approach, which had been to set overly
optimistic deadlines and then try to get engineers to work nonstop for days
on end to meet the goals. “If you asked Elon how long it would take to do
something, there was never anything in his mind that would take more than
an hour,” Ambras said. “We came to interpret an hour as really taking a day
or two and if Elon ever did say something would take a day, we allowed for
a week or two weeks.”
Starting Zip2 and watching it grow imbued Musk with self-confidence.
Terence Beney, one of Musk’s high school friends, came to California for a
visit and noticed the change in Musk’s character right away. He watched
Musk confront a nasty landlord who had been giving his mother, who was
renting an apartment in town, a hard time. “He said, ‘If you’re going to
bully someone, bully me.’ It was startling to see him take over the situation.
The last time I had seen him he was this geeky, awkward kid who would
sometimes lose his temper. He was the kid you would pick on to get a
response. Now he was confident and in control.” Musk also began
consciously trying to manage his criticism of others. “Elon is not someone
who would say, ‘I feel you. I see your point of view,’” said Justine.
“Because he doesn’t have that ‘I feel you’ dimension there were things that
seemed obvious to other people that weren’t that obvious to him. He had to
learn that a twenty-something-year-old shouldn’t really shoot down the
plans of older, senior people and point out everything wrong with them. He
learned to modify his behavior in certain ways. I just think he comes at the
world through strategy and intellect.” The personality tweaks worked with
varying degrees of success. Musk still tended to drive the young engineers
mad with his work demands and blunt criticism. “I remember being in a
meeting once brainstorming about a new product—a new-car site,” said
Doris Downes, the creative director at Zip2. “Someone complained about a
technical change that we wanted being impossible. Elon turned and said, ‘I
don’t really give a damn what you think,’ and walked out of the meeting.
For Elon, the word no does not exist, and he expects that attitude from
everyone around him.” Periodically, Musk let loose on the more senior
executives as well. “You would see people come out of the meetings with
this disgusted look on their face,” Mohr, the salesman, said. “You don’t get
to where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was just so driven
and sure of himself.”
As Musk tried to come to terms with the changes the investors had
inflicted on Zip2, he did enjoy some of the perks of having big-money
backing. The financiers helped the Musk brothers with their visas. They
also gave them $30,000 each to buy cars. Musk and Kimbal had traded in
their dilapidated BMW for a dilapidated sedan that they spray-painted with
polka dots. Kimbal upgraded from that to a BMW 3 Series, and Musk
bought a Jaguar E-Type. “It kept breaking down, and would arrive at the
office on a flatbed,” Kimbal said. “But Elon always thought big.”*
As a bonding exercise one weekend, Musk, Ambras, a few other
employees and friends took off for a bike ride through the Saratoga Gap
trail in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the riders had been training and
were accustomed to strenuous sessions and the summer’s heat. They set up
the mountains at a furious pace. After an hour, Russ Rive, Musk’s cousin,
reached the top and proceeded to vomit. Right behind him were the rest of
the cyclists. Then, fifteen minutes later, Musk became visible to the group.
His face had turned purple, and sweat poured out of him, and he made it to
the top. “I always think back to that ride. He wasn’t close to being in the
condition needed for it,” Ambras said. “Anyone else would have quit or
walked up their bike. As I watched him climb that final hundred feet with
suffering all over his face, I thought, That’s Elon. Do or die but don’t give
up.”
Musk continued to be a ball of energy around the office as well. Ahead
of visits by venture capitalists and other investors, Musk would rally the
troops and instruct them all to get on the phone to create a buzzy
atmosphere. He also formed a video-game team to participate in
competitions around Quake, a first-person-shooter game. “We competed in
one of the first nationwide tournaments,” Musk said. “We came in second,
and we would have come in first, but one of our top players’ machine
crashed because he had pushed his graphics card too hard. We won a few
thousand dollars.”
Zip2 had remarkable success courting newspapers. The New York Times,
Knight Ridder, Hearst Corporation, and other media properties signed up to
its service. Some of these companies contributed $50 million in additional
funding for Zip2. Services like Craigslist with its free online classifieds had
just started to appear, and the newspapers needed some course of action.
“The newspapers knew they were in trouble with the Internet, and the idea
was to sign up as many of them as possible,” Ambras said. “They wanted
classifieds and listings for real estate, automotive, and entertainment and
could use us as a platform for all these online services.” Zip2 acquired a
trademark for its “We Power the Press” slogan and the influx of cash kept
Zip2 growing fast. Company headquarters were soon so crowded that one
desk ended up directly in front of the women’s bathroom. In 1997, Zip2
moved into flashier, more spacious digs at 444 Castro Street in Mountain
View.
It irritated Musk that Zip2 had become a behind-the-scenes player to the
newspapers. He believed the company could offer interesting services
directly to consumers and encouraged the purchase of the domain name
city.com with the hopes of turning it into a consumer destination. But the
lure of the media companies’ money kept Sorkin and the board on a
conservative path, and they decided to worry about a consumer push down
the road.
In April 1998, Zip2 announced a blockbuster move to double down on
its strategy. It would merge with its main competitor CitySearch in a deal
valued at around $300 million. The new company would retain the
CitySearch name, while Sorkin would head up the venture. On paper, the
union looked very much like a merger of equals. CitySearch had built up an
extensive set of directories for cities around the country. It also appeared to
have strong sales and marketing teams that would complement the talented
engineers at Zip2. The merger had been announced in the press and seemed
inevitable.
The opinions on what happened next vary greatly. The logistics of the
situation required the two companies to go over each other’s books and to
figure out which employees would be fired to avoid a duplication of roles.
This process raised some questions about how frank CitySearch had been
with its financials and rankled some executives at Zip2 who could see their
positions being diminished or erased altogether at the new company. One
faction inside Zip2 argued that the deal should be abandoned, while Sorkin
demanded that it go through. Musk, who had been an early advocate of the
deal, turned against it. In May 1998, the two companies canceled the
merger, and the press pounced, making a big deal of the chaotic bust-up.
Musk urged Zip2’s board to oust Sorkin and reinstate him as CEO of Zip2.
The board declined. Instead, Musk lost his chairman title, and Sorkin was
replaced by Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist with Mohr Davidow.
Sorkin considered Musk’s behavior through the whole affair atrocious and
later pointed to the board’s reaction and Musk’s demotion as evidence that
they felt the same way. “There was a lot of backlash and finger-pointing,”
Proudian said. “Elon wanted to be CEO, but I said, ‘This is your first
company. Let’s find an acquirer and make some money, so you can do your
second, third, and fourth company.’”
With the deal busted, Zip2 found itself in a predicament. It was losing
money. Musk still wanted to go the consumer route, but Proudian feared
that would take too much capital. Microsoft had mounted a charge into the
same market, and start-ups with mapping, real estate, and automotive ideas
multiplied. The Zip2 engineers were deflated and worried that they might
not be able to outrun the competition. Then, in February 1999, the PC
maker Compaq Computer suddenly offered to pay $307 million in cash for
Zip2. “It was like pennies from heaven,” said Ed Ho, a former Zip2
executive. Zip2’s board accepted the offer, and the company rented out a
restaurant in Palo Alto and threw a huge party. Mohr Davidow had made
back twenty times its original investment, and Musk and Kimbal had come
away with $22 million and $15 million, respectively. Musk never
entertained the idea of sticking around at Compaq. “As soon as it was clear
the company would be sold, Elon was on to his next project,” Proudian said.
From that point on, Musk would fight to maintain control of his companies
and stay CEO. “We were overwhelmed and just thought these guys must
know what they’re doing,” Kimbal said. “But they’ didn’t. There was no
vision once they took over. They were investors, and we got on well with
them, but the vision had just disappeared from the company.”
Years later, after he had time to reflect on the Zip2 situation, Musk
realized that he could have handled some of the situations with employees
better. “I had never really run a team of any sort before,” Musk said. “I’d
never been a sports captain or a captain of anything or managed a single
person. I had to think, Okay, what are the things that affect how a team
functions. The first obvious assumption would be that other people will
behave like you. But that’s not true. Even if they would like to behave like
you, they don’t necessarily have all the assumptions or information that you
have in your mind. So, if I know a certain set of things, and I talk to a
replica of myself but only communicate half the information, you can’t
expect that the replica would come to the same conclusion. You have to put
yourself in a position where you say, ‘Well, how would this sound to them,
knowing what they know?’”
Employees at Zip2 would go home at night, come back, and find that
Musk had changed their work without talking to them, and Musk’s
confrontational style did more harm than good. “Yeah, we had some very
good software engineers at Zip2, but I mean, I could code way better than
them. And I’d just go in and fix their fucking code,” Musk said. “I would be
frustrated waiting for their stuff, so I’m going to go and fix your code and
now it runs five times faster, you idiot. There was one guy who wrote a
quantum mechanics equation, a quantum probability on the board, and he
got it wrong. I’m like, ‘How can you write that?’ Then I corrected it for
him. He hated me after that. Eventually, I realized, Okay, I might have fixed
that thing but now I’ve made the person unproductive. It just wasn’t a good
way to go about things.”
Musk, the dot-com striver, had been both lucky and good. He had a
decent idea, turned it into a real service, and came out of the dot-com tumult
with cash in his pockets, which was better than what many of his
compatriots could say. The process had been painful. Musk had yearned to
be a leader, but the people around him struggled to see how Musk as the
CEO could work. As far as Musk was concerned, they were all wrong, and
he set out to prove his point with what would end up being even more
dramatic results.

PAYPAL MAFIA BOSS
THE SALE OF ZIP2 INFUSED ELON MUSK WITH A NEW BRAND
OF CONFIDENCE. Much like the video-game characters he adored, Musk
had leveled up. He had solved Silicon Valley and become what everyone at
the time wanted to be—a dot-com millionaire. His next venture would need
to live up to his rapidly inflating ambition. This left Musk searching for an
industry that had tons of money and inefficiencies that he and the Internet
could exploit. Musk began thinking back to his time as an intern at the Bank
of Nova Scotia. His big takeaway from that job, that bankers are rich and
dumb, now had the feel of a massive opportunity.
During his time working for the head of strategy at the bank in the early
1990s, Musk had been asked to take a look at the company’s third-world
debt portfolio. This pool of money went by the depressing name of “lessdeveloped
country debt,” and Bank of Nova Scotia had billions of dollars of
it. Countries throughout South America and elsewhere had defaulted in the
years prior, forcing the bank to write down some of its debt value. Musk’s
boss wanted him to dig into the bank’s holdings as a learning experiment
and try to determine how much the debt was actually worth.
While pursuing this project, Musk stumbled upon what seemed like an
obvious business opportunity. The United States had tried to help reduce the
debt burden of a number of developing countries through so-called Brady
bonds, in which the U.S. government basically backstopped the debt of
countries like Brazil and Argentina. Musk noticed an arbitrage play. “I
calculated the backstop value, and it was something like fifty cents on the
dollar, while the actual debt was trading at twenty-five cents,” Musk said.
“This was like the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize
it.” Musk tried to remain cool and calm as he rang Goldman Sachs, one of
the main traders in this market, and probed around about what he had seen.
He inquired as to how much Brazilian debt might be available at the 25-
cents price. “The guy said, ‘How much do you want?’ and I came up with
some ridiculous number like ten billion dollars,” Musk said. When the
trader confirmed that was doable, Musk hung up the phone. “I was thinking
that they had to be fucking crazy because you could double your money.
Everything was backed by Uncle Sam. It was a no-brainer.”
Musk had spent the summer earning about fourteen dollars an hour and
getting chewed out for using the executive coffee machine, among other
status infractions, and figured his moment to shine and make a big bonus
had arrived. He sprinted up to his boss’s office and pitched the opportunity
of a lifetime. “You can make billions of dollars for free,” he said. His boss
told Musk to write up a report, which soon got passed up to the bank’s
CEO, who promptly rejected the proposal, saying the bank had been burned
on Brazilian and Argentinian debt before and didn’t want to mess with it
again. “I tried to tell them that’s not the point,” Musk said. “The point is
that it’s fucking backed by Uncle Sam. It doesn’t matter what the South
Americans do. You cannot lose unless you think the U.S. Treasury is going
to default. But they still didn’t do it, and I was stunned. Later in life, as I
competed against the banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave
me confidence. All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did. If
everyone else ran off a bloody cliff, they’d run right off a cliff with them. If
there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody
was picking it up, they wouldn’t pick it up, either.”
In the years that followed, Musk considered starting an Internet bank
and discussed it openly during his internship at Pinnacle Research in 1995.
The youthful Musk lectured the scientists about the inevitable transition
coming in finance toward online systems, but they tried to talk him down,
saying that it would takes ages for Web security to be good enough to win
over consumers. Musk, though, remained convinced that the finance
industry could do with a major upgrade and that he could have a big
influence on banking with a relatively small investment. “Money is low
bandwidth,” he said, during a speech at Stanford University in 2003, to
describe his thinking. “You don’t need some sort of big infrastructure
improvement to do things with it. It’s really just an entry in a database.”
The actual plan that Musk concocted was beyond grandiose. As the
researchers at Pinnacle had pointed out, people were barely comfortable
buying books online. They might take their chances entering a credit card
number but exposing just their bank accounts to the Web was out of the
question to many. Pah. So what? Musk wanted to build a full-service
financial institution online: a company that would have savings and
checking accounts as well as brokerage services and insurance. The
technology to build such a service was possible, but navigating the
regulatory hell of creating an online bank from scratch looked like an
intractable problem to optimists and an impossibility to more level heads.
This was not dishing out directions to a pizzeria or putting up a house
listing. It was dealing with people’s finances, and there would be real
repercussions if the service did not work as billed.
Undaunted, Musk kicked this new plan into action before Zip2 had even
been sold. He chatted up some of the best engineers at the company to get a
feel for who might be willing to join him in another venture. Musk also
bounced his ideas off some contacts he’d made at the bank in Canada. In
January 1999, with Zip2’s board seeking a buyer, Musk began to formalize
his banking plan. The deal with Compaq was announced the next month.
And in March, Musk incorporated X.com, a finance start-up with a
pornographic-sounding name.
It had taken Musk less than a decade to go from being a Canadian
backpacker to becoming a multimillionaire at the age of twenty-seven. With
his $22 million, he moved from sharing an apartment with three roommates
to buying an 1,800-square-foot condo and renovating it. He also bought a
$1 million McLaren F1 sports car and a small prop plane and learned to fly.
Musk embraced the newfound celebrity that he’d earned as part of the dotcom
millionaire set. He let CNN show up at his apartment at 7 A.M. to film
the delivery of the car. A black eighteen-wheeler pulled up in front of
Musk’s place and then lowered the sleek, sliver vehicle onto the street,
while Musk stood slack-jawed with his arms folded. “There are sixty-two
McLarens in the world, and I will own one of them,” he told CNN. “Wow, I
can’t believe it’s actually here. That’s pretty wild, man.”
CNN interspersed video of the car delivery with interviews with Musk.
The whole time he looked like a caricature of an engineer who had made it
big. Musk’s hair had started thinning, and he had a closely cropped cut that
accentuated his boyish face. He wore an all-too-big brown sport coat and
checked his cell phone from his lavish car, sitting next to his gorgeous
girlfriend, Justine, and he seemed spellbound by his life. Musk rolled out
one laughable rich-guy line after another, talking first about the Zip2 deal
—“Receiving cash is cash. I mean, those are just a large number of Ben
Franklins”—next about the awesomeness of his life—“There it is,
gentlemen, the fastest car in the world”—and then about his prodigious
ambition—“I could go and buy one of the islands in the Bahamas and turn it
into my personal fiefdom, but I am much more interested in trying to build
and create a new company.” The camera crew followed Musk to the X.com
offices, where his cocksure delivery led to another round of cringe-worthy
statements: “I do not fit the picture of a banker,” “Raising fifty million
dollars is a matter of making a series of phone calls, and the money is
there,” “I think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza.”
Musk purchased the McLaren from a seller in Florida, snatching the car
away from Ralph Lauren, who had also inquired about buying it. Even very
wealthy people like Lauren would tend to reserve something like a
McLaren for special events or the occasional Sunday drive. Not Musk. He
drove it all around Silicon Valley and parked it on the street by the X.com
offices. His friends were horrified to see such a work of art covered with
bird droppings or in the parking lot of a Safeway. One day, Musk e-mailed
fellow McLaren owner Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of the
software maker Oracle, out of the blue to see if he wanted to go race cars
around a track for fun. Jim Clark, another billionaire who liked fast things,
caught wind of the proposal and told a friend that he needed to rush over to
the local Ferrari dealership to buy something that could compete. Musk had
joined the big boys’ club. “Elon was super-excited about all of this,” said
George Zachary, a venture capitalist and close friend of Musk’s. “He
showed me the correspondence with Larry.” The next year, while driving
down Sand Hill Road to meet with an investor, Musk turned to a friend in
the car and said, “Watch this.” He floored the car, did a lane change, spun
out, and hit an embankment, which started the car spinning in midair like a
Frisbee. The windows and wheels were blown to smithereens, and the body
of the car damaged. Musk again turned to his companion and said, “The
funny part is it wasn’t insured.” The two of them then thumbed a ride to the
venture capitalist’s office.
To his credit, Musk did not fully buy in to this playboy persona. He
actually plowed the majority of the money he made from Zip2 into X.com.
There were practical reasons for this decision. Investors catch a break under
the tax law if they roll a windfall into a new venture within a couple of
months. But even by Silicon Valley’s high-risk standards, it was shocking to
put so much of one’s newfound wealth into something as iffy as an online
bank. All told, Musk invested about $12 million into X.com, leaving him,
after taxes, with $4 million or so for personal use. “That’s part of what
separates Elon from mere mortals,” said Ed Ho, the former Zip2 executive,
who went on to cofound X.com. “He’s willing to take an insane amount of
personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays off or you end up
in a bus shelter somewhere.”
Musk’s decision to invest so much money in X.com looks even more
unusual in hindsight. Much of the point of being a dot-com success in 1999
was to prove yourself once, stash away your millions, and then use your
credentials to talk other people into betting their money on your next
venture. Musk would certainly go on to rely on outside investors, but he put
major skin in the game as well. So while Musk could be found on television
talking like the rest of the self-absorbed dot-com schmucks, he behaved
more like a throwback to Silicon Valley’s earlier days, when the founders of
companies like Intel were willing to take huge gambles on themselves.
Where Zip2 had been a neat, useful idea, X.com held the promise of
fomenting a major revolution. Musk, for the first time, would be
confronting a deep-pocketed, entrenched industry head-on with the hopes of
upending all of the incumbents. Musk also began to hone his trademark
style of entering an ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he
knew very little about the industry’s nuances bother him in the slightest. He
had an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he
could run the business better than everyone else. Musk’s ego and
confidence had started heading toward the levels that would inspire some
and leave others thinking of him as pompous and unscrupulous. The
creation of X.com would ultimately reveal a great deal about Musk’s
creativity, relentless drive, confrontational style, and foibles as a leader.
Musk would also get another taste of being pushed aside at his own
company and the pain that accompanies a grand vision left unfulfilled.
Musk assembled what looked like an all-star crew to start X.com. Ho
had worked at SGI and Zip2 as an engineer, and his peers marveled at his
coding and team-management skills. They were joined by a pair of
Canadians with finance experience—Harris Fricker and Christopher Payne.
Musk had met Fricker during his time as an intern at the Bank of Nova
Scotia, and the two really hit it off. A Rhodes scholar, Fricker brought the
knowledge of the banking world’s mechanics that X.com would need.
Payne was Fricker’s friend from the Canadian finance community. All four
men were considered cofounders of the company, while Musk emerged as
the largest shareholder thanks to his hefty up-front investment. X.com
began, like so many Silicon Valley operations, at a house where the
cofounders began brainstorming, and then moved to more formal offices at
394 University Avenue in Palo Alto.
The cofounders were aligned philosophically around the idea that the
banking industry had fallen behind the times. Visiting a branch bank to
speak with a teller seemed pretty archaic now that the Internet had arrived.
The rhetoric sounded good, and the four men were enthused. The only thing
stopping them was reality. Musk had a modicum of banking experience and
had resorted to buying a book on the industry to help understand its inner
workings. The more the cofounders thought about their plan of attack, the
more they realized the regulatory issues blocking the creation of an online
bank were insurmountable. “As four and five months went by, the onion
just kept unwrapping,” said Ho.*
From the outset, there were personality clashes as well. Musk had
become a budding superstar in Silicon Valley and had the press fawning
over him. This didn’t sit that well with Fricker, who’d moved from Canada
and pegged X.com as his chance to make a mark on the world as a banking
whiz. Fricker, according to numerous people, wanted to run X.com and do
so in a more conventional manner. He found Musk’s visionary statements to
the press about rethinking the entire banking industry silly since the
company was struggling to build much of anything. “We were out
promising the sun, moon, and the stars to the media,” Fricker said. “Elon
would say that this is not a normal business environment, and you have to
suspend normal business thinking. He said, ‘There is a happy-gas factory up
on the hill, and it’s pumping stuff into the Valley.’” Fricker would not be the
last person to accuse Musk of overhyping products and playing the public,
although whether this is a flaw or one of Musk’s great talents as a
businessman is up for debate.
The squabble between Fricker and Musk came to a quick, nasty end.
Just five months after X.com had started, Fricker initiated a coup. “He said
either he takes over as CEO or he’s just going to take everyone from the
company and create his own company,” Musk said. “I don’t do well with
blackmail. I said, ‘You should go do that.’ So he did.” Musk tried to talk Ho
and some of the other key engineers into staying, but they sided with
Fricker and left. Musk ended up with a shell of a company and a handful of
loyal employees. “After all that went down, I remember sitting with Elon in
his office,” said Julie Ankenbrandt, an early X.com employee who stayed.
“There were a million laws in place to block something like X.com from
happening, but Elon didn’t care. He just looked at me and said, ‘I guess we
should hire some more people.’”*
Musk had been trying to raise funding for X.com and had been forced to
go to venture capitalists and confess that there wasn’t much in the way of a
company left. Mike Moritz, a famed investor from Sequoia Capital, backed
the company nonetheless, making a bet on Musk and little else. Musk hit
the streets of Silicon Valley once again and managed to attract engineers
with his rah-rah speeches about the future of Internet banking. Scott
Anderson, a young computer scientist, started on August 1, 1999, just a few
days after the exodus, and bought right into the vision. “You look back, and
it was total insanity,” Anderson said. “We had what amounted to a
Hollywood movie set of a website. It barely got past the VCs.”
Week by week, more engineers arrived and the vision became more real.
The company secured a banking license and a mutual fund license and
formed a partnership with Barclays. By November, X.com’s small software
team had created one of the world’s first online banks complete with FDIC
insurance to back the bank accounts and three mutual funds for investors to
choose. Musk gave the engineers $100,000 of his own money to conduct
their testing. On the night before Thanksgiving in 1999, X.com went live to
the public. “I was there until two A.M.,” Anderson said. “Then, I went home
to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Elon called me a few hours later and asked
me to come into the office to relieve some of the other engineers. Elon
stayed there forty-eight straight hours, making sure things worked.”
Under Musk’s direction, X.com tried out some radical banking
concepts. Customers received a $20 cash card just for signing up to use the
service and a $10 card for every person they referred. Musk did away with
niggling fees and overdraft penalties. In a very modern twist, X.com also
built a person-to-person payment system in which you could send someone
money just by plugging their e-mail address into the site. The whole idea
was to shift away from slow-moving banks with their mainframes taking
days to process payments and to create a kind of agile bank account where
you could move money around with a couple of clicks on a mouse or an email.
This was revolutionary stuff, and more than 200,000 people bought
into it and signed up for X.com within the first couple of months of
operation.
Soon enough, X.com had a major competitor. A couple of brainy kids
named Max Levchin and Peter Thiel had been working on a payment
system of their own at their start-up called Confinity. The duo actually
rented their office space—a glorified broom closet—from X.com and were
trying to make it possible for owners of Palm Pilot handhelds to swap
money via the infrared ports on the devices. Between X.com and Confinity,
the small office on University Avenue had turned into the frenzied epicenter
of the Internet finance revolution. “It was this mass of adolescent men that
worked so hard,” Ankenbrandt said. “It stunk so badly in there. I can still
smell it—leftover pizza, body odor, and sweat.”
The pleasantries between X.com and Confinity came to an abrupt end.
The Confinity founders moved to an office down the street and, like X.com,
began focusing their attention on Web and e-mail-based payments with their
service known as PayPal. The companies became locked in a heated battle
to match each other’s features and attract more users, knowing that whoever
got bigger faster would win. Tens of millions of dollars were spent on
promotions, while millions more were lost battling hackers who had seized
upon the services as new playgrounds for fraud. “It was like the Internet
version of making it rain at a strip club,” said Jeremy Stoppelman, an
X.com engineer who went on to become the CEO of Yelp. “You gave away
money as fast as you could.”
The race to win Internet payments gave Musk a chance to show off his
quick thinking and work ethic. He kept devising plans to counter the
advantage PayPal had established on auction sites like eBay. And he rallied
the X.com employees to implement the tactics as fast as possible using
brute-force appeals to their competitive natures. “There really wasn’t
anything suave about him,” Ankenbrandt said. “We all worked twenty hours
a day, and he worked twenty-three hours.”
In March 2000, X.com and Confinity finally decided to stop trying to
spend each other into oblivion and to join forces. Confinity had what looked
like the hottest product in PayPal but was paying out $100,000 a day in
awards to new customers and didn’t have the cash reserves to keep going.
X.com, by contrast, still had plenty of cash reserves and the more
sophisticated banking products. It took the lead in setting the merger terms,
leaving Musk as the largest shareholder of the combined company, which
would be called X.com. Shortly after the deal closed, X.com raised $100
million from backers including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs and
boasted that it had more than one million customers.*
The two companies tried hard to mesh their cultures, with modest
success. Groups of employees from X.com tied their computer monitors to
their desk chairs with power cords and rolled them down the street to the
Confinity offices to work alongside their new colleagues. But the teams
could never quite see eye to eye. Musk kept championing the X.com brand,
while most everyone else favored PayPal. More fights broke out over the
design of the company’s technology infrastructure. The Confinity team led
by Levchin favored moving toward open-source software like Linux, while
Musk championed Microsoft’s data-center software as being more likely to
keep productivity high. This squabble may sound silly to outsiders, but it
was the equivalent of a religious war to the engineers, many of whom
viewed Microsoft as a dated evil empire and Linux as the modern software
of the people. Two months after the merger, Thiel resigned and Levchin
threatened to walk out over the technology rift. Musk was left to run a
fractured company.
The technology issues X.com had been facing worsened as the
computing systems failed to keep up with an exploding customer base.
Once a week, the company’s website collapsed. Most of the engineers were
ordered to start work designing a new system, which distracted key
technical personnel and left X.com vulnerable to fraud. “We were losing
money hand over fist,” said Stoppelman. As X.com became more popular
and its transaction volume exploded, all of its problems worsened. There
was more fraud. There were more fees from banks and credit card
companies. There was more competition from start-ups. X.com lacked a
cohesive business model to offset the losses and turn a profit from the
money it managed. Roelof Botha, the start-up’s chief financial officer and
now a prominent venture capitalist at Sequoia, did not think Musk provided
the board with a true picture of X.com’s issues. A growing number of other
people at the company questioned Musk’s decision-making in the face of all
the crises.
What followed was one of the nastiest coups in Silicon Valley’s long,
illustrious history of nasty coups. A small group of X.com employees
gathered one night at Fanny & Alexander, a now-defunct bar in Palo Alto,
and brainstormed about how to push out Musk. They decided to sell the
board on the idea of Thiel returning as CEO. Instead of confronting Musk
directly with this plan, the conspirators decided to take action behind
Musk’s back.
Musk and Justine had been married in January 2000 but had been too
busy for a honeymoon. Nine months later, in September, they planned to
mix business and pleasure by going on a fund-raising trip and ending it with
a honeymoon in Sydney to catch the Olympics. As they boarded their flight
one night, X.com executives delivered letters of no confidence to X.com’s
board. Some of the people loyal to Musk had sensed something was wrong,
but it was too late. “I went to the office at ten thirty that night, and everyone
was there,” Ankenbrandt said. “I could not believe it. I am frantically trying
to call Elon, but he’s on a plane.” By the time he landed, Musk had been
replaced by Thiel.
When Musk finally heard what had happened, he hopped on the next
plane back to Palo Alto. “It was shocking, but I will give Elon this—I
thought he handled it pretty well,” Justine said. For a brief period, Musk
tried to fight back. He urged the board to reconsider its decision. But when
it became clear that the company had already moved on, Musk relented. “I
talked to Moritz and a few others,” Musk said. “It wasn’t so much that I
wanted to be CEO but more like, ‘Hey, I think there are some pretty
important things that need to happen, and if I’m not CEO, I’m not sure they
are going to happen.’ But then I talked to Max and Peter, and it seemed like
they would make these things happen. So then, I mean, it’s not the end of
the world.”
Many of the X.com employees who had been with Musk since early on
were less than impressed by what had happened. “I was floored by it and
angry,” said Stoppelman. “Elon was sort of a rock star in my view. I was
very vocal about how I thought it was bullshit. But I knew fundamentally
that the company was doing well. It was a rocket ship, and I wasn’t going to
leave.” Stoppelman, then twenty-three, went into a conference room and
tore into Thiel and Levchin. “They let me vent it all out, and their reaction
was part of the reason I stayed.” Others remained embittered. “It was
backhanded and cowardly,” said Branden Spikes, a Zip2 and X.com
engineer. “I would have been more behind it if Elon had been in the room.”
By June 2001, Musk’s influence on the company was fading quickly.
That month, Thiel rebranded X.com as PayPal. Musk rarely lets a slight go
unpunished. Throughout this ordeal, however, he showed incredible
restraint. He embraced the role of being an advisor to the company and kept
investing in it, increasing his stake as PayPal’s largest shareholder. “You
would expect someone in Elon’s position to be bitter and vindictive, but he
wasn’t,” said Botha. “He supported Peter. He was a prince.”
The next few months would end up being key for Musk’s future. The
dot-com joyride was coming to a quick end, and people wanted to try to
cash out in any way possible. When executives from eBay began
approaching PayPal about an acquisition, the inclination for most people
was to sell and sell fast. Musk and Moritz, though, urged the board to reject
a number of offers and hold out for more money. PayPal had revenue of
about $240 million per year, and looked like it might make it as an
independent company and go public. Musk and Moritz’s resistance paid off
and then some. In July 2002, eBay offered $1.5 billion for PayPal, and
Musk and the rest of the board accepted the deal. Musk netted about $250
million from the sale to eBay, or $180 million after taxes—enough to make
what would turn out to be his very wild dreams possible.
The PayPal episode was a mixed bag for Musk. His reputation as a
leader suffered in the aftermath of the deal, and the media turned on him in
earnest for the first time. Eric Jackson, an early Confinity employee, wrote
The PayPal Wars: Battles with eBay, the Media, the Mafia, and the Rest of
Planet Earth in 2004 and recounted the company’s tumultuous journey. The
book painted Musk as an egomaniacal, stubborn jerk, making wrong
decisions at every turn, and portrayed Thiel and Levchin as heroic geniuses.
Valleywag, the technology industry gossip site, piled on as well and turned
bashing Musk into one of its pet projects. The criticisms grew to the point
that people started wondering aloud whether or not Musk counted as a true
cofounder of PayPal or had just ridden Thiel’s coattails to a magical payday.
The tone of the book along with the blog posts goaded Musk in 2007 into
writing a 2,200-word e-mail to Valleywag meant to set the record straight
with his version of events.
In the e-mail, Musk let his literary flair loose and gave the public a
direct look at his combative side. He described Jackson as “a sycophantic
jackass” and “one notch above an intern,” who had little insight into the
high-level goings-on at the company. “Since Eric worships Peter, the
outcome was obvious—Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my
role is somewhere between negligible and a bad seed,” Musk wrote. Musk
then detailed seven reasons why he deserved cofounder status of PayPal,
including his role as its largest shareholder, the hiring of a lot of the top
talent, the creation of a number of the company’s most successful business
ideas, and his time as CEO when the company went from sixty to several
hundred employees.
Almost everyone I interviewed from the PayPal days leaned toward
agreeing with Musk’s overall assessment. They said that Jackson’s account
bordered on fantasy when it came to celebrating the Confinity team over
Musk and the X.com team. “There are a lot of PayPal people that suffer
from warped memories,” said Botha.
But these same people reached another consensus, saying that Musk had
mishandled the branding, technology infrastructure, and fraud situations. “I
think it would have killed the company if Elon had stayed on as CEO for
six more months,” said Botha. “The mistakes Elon was making at the time
were amplifying the risk of the business.” (For more on Musk’s take on the
PayPal years, see Appendix 2.)
The suggestions that Musk did not count as a “true” cofounder of
PayPal seem asinine in retrospect. Thiel, Levchin, and other PayPal
executives have said as much in the years since the eBay deal closed. The
only useful thing such criticisms produced were the bombastic
counteroffensives from Musk, which revealed touches of insecurity and the
seriousness with which Musk insists that the historical record reflect his
take on events. “He comes from the school of thought in the public relations
world that you let no inaccuracy go uncorrected,” said Vince Sollitto, the
former communications chief at PayPal. “It sets a precedent, and you
should fight every out-of-place comma tooth and nail. He takes things very
personally and usually seeks war.”
The stronger critique of Musk during this period of his life was that he
had succeeded to a large degree despite himself. Musk’s traits as a
confrontational know-it-all and his abundant ego created deep, lasting
fractures within his companies. While Musk consciously tried to temper his
behavior, these efforts were not enough to win over investors and more
experienced executives. At both Zip2 and PayPal, the companies’ boards
came to the conclusion that Musk was not yet CEO material. It can also be
argued that Musk had become a hyperbolic huckster, who overreached and
oversold his companies’ technology. Musk’s biggest detractors have made
all of these arguments either in public or private and a half dozen or so of
them said far worse things to me about his character and actions, describing
Musk as unethical in business and vicious with his personal attacks. Almost
universally, these people were unwilling to go on the record with their
comments, claiming to be afraid Musk would pursue litigation against them
or ruin their ability to do business.
These criticisms must be weighed against Musk’s track record. He
demonstrated an innate ability to read people and technology trends at the
inception of the consumer Web. While others tried to wrap their heads
around the Internet’s implications, Musk had already set off on a purposeful
plan of attack. He envisioned many of the early pieces of technology—
directories, maps, sites that focused on vertical markets—that would
become mainstays on the Web. Then, just as people became comfortable
with buying things from Amazon.com and eBay, Musk made the great leap
forward to full-fledged Internet banking. He would bring standard financial
instruments online and then modernize the industry with a host of new
concepts. He exhibited a deep insight into human nature that helped his
companies pull off exceptional marketing, technology, and financial feats.
Musk was already playing the entrepreneur game at the highest level and
working the press and investors like few others could. Did he hype things
up and rub people the wrong way? Absolutely—and with spectacular
results.
Based in large part on Musk’s guidance, PayPal survived the bursting of
the dot-com bubble, became the first blockbuster IPO after the 9/11 attacks,
and then sold to eBay for an astronomical sum while the rest of the
technology industry was mired in a dramatic downturn. It was nearly
impossible to survive let alone emerge as a winner in the midst of such a
mess.
PayPal also came to represent one of the greatest assemblages of
business and engineering talent in Silicon Valley history. Both Musk and
Thiel had a keen eye for young, brilliant engineers. The founders of startups
as varied as YouTube, Palantir Technologies, and Yelp all worked at
PayPal. Another set of people—including Reid Hoffman, Thiel, and Botha
—emerged as some of the technology industry’s top investors. PayPal staff
pioneered techniques in fighting online fraud that have formed the basis of
software used by the CIA and FBI to track terrorists and of software used
by the world’s largest banks to combat crime. This collection of superbright
employees has become known as the PayPal Mafia—more or less the
current ruling class of Silicon Valley—and Musk is its most famous and
successful member.
Hindsight also continues to favor Musk’s unbridled vision over the more
cautious pragmatism of executives at Zip2 and PayPal. Had it chased
consumers as Musk urged, Zip2 may have ended up as a blockbuster
mapping and review service. As for PayPal, an argument can still be made
that the investors sold out too early and should have listened more to
Musk’s demands to remain independent. By 2014, PayPal had amassed 153
million users and was valued at close to $32 billion as a stand-alone
company. A flood of payment and banking start-ups have appeared as well
—Square, Stripe, and Simple, to name three among the S’s—that have
looked to fulfill much of the original X.com vision.
If X.com’s board had been a bit more patient with Musk, there’s good
reason to believe he would have succeeded with delivery of the “online
bank to rule them all” that he had set out to create. History has
demonstrated that while Musk’s goals can sound absurd in the moment, he
certainly believes in them and, when given enough time, tends to achieve
them. “He always works from a different understanding of reality than the
rest of us,” Ankenbrandt said. “He is just different than the rest of us.”
While navigating the business tumult of Zip2 and PayPal, Musk found a
moment of peace in his personal life. He’d spent years courting Justine
Wilson from afar, flying her out for visits on the weekends. For a long time,
his oppressive hours and his roommates put a crimp on the relationship. But
the Zip2 sale let Musk buy a place of his own and pay a bit more attention
to Justine. Like any couple, they had their ups and downs, but that passion
of young love remained. “We fought a lot, but when we weren’t fighting,
there was a deep sense of compassion—a bond,” Justine said. The couple
had been sparring for a few days about phone calls Justine kept getting from
an ex-boyfriend—“Elon didn’t like that”—and had a major spat while
walking near the X.com offices. “I remember thinking it was a lot of drama,
and that if I was going to put up with it, we might as well be married. I told
him he should just propose to me,” Justine said. It took Musk a few minutes
to cool down and then he did just that, proposing on the spot. A few days
later, a more chivalrous Musk returned to the sidewalk, got down on bended
knee, and presented Justine with a ring.
Justine knew all about Musk’s grim childhood and the intense range of
emotions he could exhibit. Her romantic sensibilities overrode any
trepidation she might have had about these parts of Musk’s history and
character and centered instead on his strength. Musk often talked fondly
about Alexander the Great, and Justine saw him as her own conquering
hero. “He wasn’t afraid of responsibility,” she said. “He didn’t run from
things. He wanted to get married and have kids early on.” Musk also
exuded a confidence and passion that made Justine think life with him
would always be okay. “Money is not his motivation, and, quite frankly, I
think it just happens for him,” Justine said. “It’s just there. He knows he can
generate it.”
At their wedding reception, Justine encountered the other side of the
conquering hero. Musk pulled Justine close while they danced, and
informed her, “I am the alpha in this relationship.”3 Two months later,
Justine signed a postnuptial financial agreement that would come back to
haunt her and entered into an enduring power struggle. She described the
situation years later in an article for Marie Claire, writing, “He was
constantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. ‘I am your wife,’ I
told him repeatedly, ‘not your employee.’ ‘If you were my employee,’ he
said just as often, ‘I would fire you.’”
The newlyweds were not helped by the drama at X.com. They’d put off
their honeymoon and then had it derailed by the coup. It took until late
December 2000 for things to calm down enough for Musk to take his first
vacation in years. He arranged a two-week trip, with the first part taking
place in Brazil and the second in South Africa at a game reserve near the
Mozambique border. While in Africa, Musk contracted the most virulent
version of malaria—falciparum malaria—which accounts for the vast
majority of malaria deaths.
Musk returned to California in January, which is when the illness took
hold. He started to get sick and was bedridden for a few days before Justine
took him to a doctor who then ordered that Musk be rushed in an ambulance
to Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City.* Doctors there misdiagnosed and
mistreated his condition to the point that Musk was near death. “Then, there
happened to be a guy visiting from another hospital who had seen a lot
more malaria cases,” Musk said. He spied Musk’s blood work in the lab and
ordered an immediate maximum dosage of doxycycline, an antibiotic. The
doctor told Musk that if he had turned up a day later, the medicine likely
would no longer have been effective.
Musk spent ten agonizing days in the intensive care unit. The
experience shocked Justine. “He’s built like a tank,” she said. “He has a
level of stamina and an ability to deal with levels of stress that I’ve never
seen in anyone else. To see him laid low like that in total misery was like a
visit to an alternate universe.” It took Musk six months to recover. He lost
forty-five pounds over the course of the illness and had a closet full of
clothes that no longer fit. “I came very close to dying,” Musk said. “That’s
my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.”

MICE IN SPACE
ELON MUSK TURNED THIRTY IN JUNE 2001, and the birthday hit
him hard. “I’m no longer a child prodigy,” he told Justine, only half joking.
That same month X.com officially changed its name to PayPal, providing a
harsh reminder that the company had been ripped away from Musk and
given to someone else to run. The start-up life, which Musk described as
akin to “eating glass and staring into the abyss,”4 had gotten old and so had
Silicon Valley. It felt like Musk was living inside a trade show where
everyone worked in the technology industry and talked all the time about
funding, IPOs, and chasing big paydays. People liked to brag about the
crazy hours they worked, and Justine would just laugh, knowing Musk had
lived a more extreme version of the Silicon Valley lifestyle than they could
imagine. “I had friends who complained that their husbands came home at
seven or eight,” she said. “Elon would come home at eleven and work some
more. People didn’t always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where
he was.”
The idea of escaping this incredibly lucrative rat race started to grow
more and more appealing. Musk’s entire life had been about chasing a
bigger stage, and Palo Alto seemed more like a stepping-stone than a final
destination. The couple decided to move south and begin their family and
the next chapter of their lives in Los Angeles.
“There’s an element to him that likes the style and the excitement and
color of a place like L.A.,” said Justine. “Elon likes to be where the action
is.” A small group of Musk’s friends who felt similarly had also decamped
to Los Angeles for what would be a wild couple of years.
It wasn’t just Los Angeles’s glitz and grandeur that attracted Musk. It
was also the call of space. After being pushed out of PayPal, Musk had
started to revisit his childhood fantasies around rocket ships and space
travel and to think that he might have a greater calling than creating Internet
services. The changes in his attitude and thinking soon became obvious to
his friends, including a group of PayPal executives who had gathered in Las
Vegas one weekend to celebrate the company’s success. “We’re all hanging
out in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some
obscure Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been
bought on eBay,” said Kevin Hartz, an early PayPal investor. “He was
studying it and talking openly about space travel and changing the world.”
Musk had picked Los Angeles with intent. It gave him access to space
or at least the space industry. Southern California’s mild, consistent weather
had made it a favored city of the aeronautics industry since the 1920s, when
the Lockheed Aircraft Company set up shop in Hollywood. Howard
Hughes, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, Boeing, and myriad other people and
organizations have performed much of their manufacturing and cuttingedge
experimentation in and around Los Angeles. Today the city remains a
major hub for the military’s aeronautics work and commercial activity.
While Musk didn’t know exactly what he wanted to do in space, he realized
that just by being in Los Angeles he would be surrounded by the world’s
top aeronautics thinkers. They could help him refine any ideas, and there
would be plenty of recruits to join his next venture.
Musk’s first interactions with the aeronautics community were with an
eclectic collection of space enthusiasts, members of a nonprofit group
called the Mars Society. Dedicated to exploring and settling the Red Planet,
the Mars Society planned to hold a fund-raiser in mid-2001. The $500-perplate
event was to take place at the house of one of the well-off Mars
Society members, and invitations to the usual characters had been mailed
out. What stunned Robert Zubrin, the head of the group, was the reply from
someone named Elon Musk, whom no one could remember inviting. “He
gave us a check for five thousand dollars,” Zubrin said. “That made
everyone take notice.” Zubrin began researching Musk, determined he was
rich, and invited him for coffee ahead of the dinner. “I wanted to make sure
he knew the projects we had under way,” Zubrin said. He proceeded to
regale Musk with tales of the research center the society had built in the
Arctic to mimic the tough conditions of Mars and the experiments they had
been running for something called the Translife Mission, in which there
would be a spinning capsule orbiting Earth that was piloted by a crew of
mice. “It would spin to give them one-third gravity—the same you would
have on Mars—and they would live there and reproduce,” Zubrin told
Musk.
When it was time for dinner, Zubrin placed Musk at the VIP table next
to himself, the director and space buff James Cameron, and Carol Stoker, a
planetary scientist for NASA with a deep interest in Mars. “Elon is so
youthful-looking and at that time he looked like a little boy,” Stoker said.
“Cameron was chatting him up right away to invest in his next movie, and
Zubrin was trying to get him to make a big donation to the Mars Society.”
In return for being hounded for cash, Musk probed about for ideas and
contacts. Stoker’s husband was an aerospace engineer at NASA working on
a concept for an airplane that would glide over Mars looking for water.
Musk loved that. “He was much more intense than some of the other
millionaires,” Zubrin said. “He didn’t know a lot about space, but he had a
scientific mind. He wanted to know exactly what was being planned in
regards to Mars and what the significance would be.” Musk took to the
Mars Society right away and joined its board of directors. He donated
another $100,000 to fund a research station in the desert as well.
Musk’s friends were not entirely sure what to make of his mental state.
He’d lost a tremendous amount of weight fighting off malaria and looked
almost skeletal. With little prompting, Musk would start expounding on his
desire to do something meaningful with his life—something lasting. His
next move had to be either in solar or in space. “He said, ‘The logical thing
to happen next is solar, but I can’t figure out how to make any money out of
it,’” said George Zachary, the investor and close friend of Musk’s, recalling
a lunch date at the time. “Then he started talking about space, and I thought
he meant office space like a real estate play.” Musk had actually started
thinking bigger than the Mars Society. Rather than send a few mice into
Earth’s orbit, Musk wanted to send them to Mars. Some very rough
calculations done at the time suggested that the journey would cost $15
million. “He asked if I thought that was crazy,” Zachary said. “I asked, ‘Do
the mice come back? Because, if they don’t, yeah, most people will think
that’s crazy.’” As it turned out, the mice were not only meant to go to Mars
and come back but were also meant to procreate along the way, during a
journey that would take months. Jeff Skoll, another one of Musk’s friends
who made a fortune at eBay, pointed out that the fornicating mice would
need a hell of a lot of cheese and bought Musk a giant wheel of Le Brouère,
a type of Gruyère.
Musk did not mind becoming the butt of cheese jokes. The more he
thought about space, the more important its exploration seemed to him. He
felt as if the public had lost some of its ambition and hope for the future.
The average person might see space exploration as a waste of time and
effort and rib him for talking about the subject, but Musk thought about
interplanetary travel in a very earnest way. He wanted to inspire the masses
and reinvigorate their passion for science, conquest, and the promise of
technology.
His fears that mankind had lost much of its will to push the boundaries
were reinforced one day when Musk went to the NASA website. He’d
expected to find a detailed plan for exploring Mars and instead found
bupkis. “At first I thought, jeez, maybe I’m just looking in the wrong
place,” Musk once told Wired. “Why was there no plan, no schedule? There
was nothing. It seemed crazy.” Musk believed that the very idea of America
was intertwined with humanity’s desire to explore. He found it sad that the
American agency tasked with doing audacious things in space and
exploring new frontiers as its mission seemed to have no serious interest in
investigating Mars at all. The spirit of Manifest Destiny had been deflated
or maybe even come to a depressing end, and hardly anyone seemed to
care. Like so many quests to revitalize America’s soul and bring hope to all
of mankind, Musk’s journey began in a hotel conference room. By this
time, Musk had built up a decent network of contacts in the space industry,
and he brought the best of them together at a series of salons—sometimes at
the Renaissance hotel at the Los Angeles airport and sometimes at the
Sheraton hotel in Palo Alto. Musk had no formal business plan for these
people to debate. He mostly wanted them to help him develop the mice-to-
Mars idea or at least to come up with something comparable. Musk hoped
to hit on a grand gesture for mankind—some type of event that would
capture the world’s attention, get people thinking about Mars again, and
have them reflect on man’s potential. The scientists and luminaries at the
meetings were to figure out a spectacle that would be technically feasible at
a price tag of approximately $20 million. Musk resigned from his position
as a director of the Mars Society and announced his own organization—the
Life to Mars Foundation.
The collection of talent attending these sessions in 2001 was impressive.
Scientists showed up from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL.
James Cameron appeared, lending some celebrity to the affair. Also
attending was Michael Griffin, whose academic credentials were
spectacular and included degrees in aerospace engineering, electrical
engineering, civil engineering, and applied physics. Griffin had worked for
the CIA’s venture capital arm called In-Q-Tel, at NASA, and at JPL and was
just in the process of leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of
satellites and spacecraft, where he had been chief technical officer and the
general manager of the space systems group. It could be argued that no one
on the planet knew more about the realities of getting things into space than
Griffin, and he was working for Musk as space thinker in chief. (Four years
later, in 2005, Griffin took over as head of NASA.)
The experts were thrilled to have another rich guy appear who was
willing to fund something interesting in space. They happily debated the
merits and feasibility of sending up rodents and watching them hump. But,
as the discussion wore on, a consensus started to build around pursuing a
different project—something called “Mars Oasis.” Under this plan, Musk
would buy a rocket and use it to shoot what amounted to a robotic
greenhouse to Mars. A group of researchers had already been working on a
space-ready growth chamber for plants. The idea was to modify their
structure, so that it could open up briefly and suck in some of the Martian
regolith, or soil, and then use it to grow a plant, which would in turn
produce the first oxygen on Mars. Much to Musk’s liking, this new plan
seemed both ostentatious and feasible.
Musk wanted the structure to have a window and a way to send a video
feedback to Earth, so that people could watch the plant grow. The group
also talked about sending out kits to students around the country who would
grow their own plants simultaneously and take notice, for example, that the
Martian plant could grow twice as high as its Earth-bound counterpart in the
same amount of time. “This concept had been floating around in various
forms for a while,” said Dave Bearden, a space industry veteran who
attended the meetings. “It would be, yes, there is life on Mars, and we put it
there. The hope was that it might turn on a light for thousands of kids that
this place is not that hostile. Then they might start thinking, Maybe we
should go there.” Musk’s enthusiasm for the idea started to inspire the
group, many of whom had grown cynical about anything novel happening
in space again. “He’s a very smart, very driven guy with a huge ego,”
Bearden said. “At one point someone mentioned that he might become Time
magazine’s Man of the Year, and you could see him light up. He has this
belief that he is the guy who can change the world.”
The main thing troubling the space experts was Musk’s budget.
Following the salons, it seemed like Musk wanted to spend somewhere
between $20 million and $30 million on the stunt, and everyone knew that
the cost of a rocket launch alone would eat up that money and then some.
“In my mind, you needed two hundred million dollars to do it right,”
Bearden said. “But people were reluctant to bring too much reality into the
situation too early and just get the whole idea killed.” Then there were the
immense engineering challenges that would need solving. “To have a big
window on this thing was a real thermal problem,” Bearden said. “You
could not keep the container warm enough to keep anything alive.”
Scooping Martian soil into the structure seemed not only hard to do
physically but also like a flat-out bad idea since the regolith would be toxic.
For a while, the scientists debated growing the plant in a nutrient-rich gel
instead, but that felt like cheating and like it might undermine the whole
point of the endeavor. Even the optimistic moments were awash in
unknowns. One scientist found some very resilient mustard seeds and
thought they could possibly survive a treated version of the Martian soil.
“There was a pretty big downside if the plant didn’t survive,” Bearden said.
“You have this dead garden on Mars that ends up giving off the opposite of
the intended effect.”*
Musk never flinched. He turned some of the volunteer thinkers into
consultants, and put them to work on the plant machine’s design. He also
plotted a trip to Russia to find out exactly how much a launch would cost.
Musk intended to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or
ICBM, from the Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help with
this, Musk reached out to Jim Cantrell, an unusual fellow who had done a
mix of classified and unclassified work for the United States and other
governments. Among other claims to fame, Cantrell had been accused of
espionage and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians after a
satellite deal went awry. “After a couple of weeks, Al Gore made some
calls, and it got worked out,” Cantrell said. “I didn’t want anything to do
with the Russians again—ever.” Musk had other ideas.
Cantrell was driving his convertible on a hot July evening in Utah when
a call came in. “This guy in a funny accent said, ‘I really need to talk to
you. I am a billionaire. I am going to start a space program.’” Cantrell could
not hear Musk well—he thought his name was Ian Musk—and said he
would call back once he got home. The two men didn’t exactly trust each
other at the outset. Musk refused to give Cantrell his cell phone number and
made the call from his fax machine. Cantrell found Musk both intriguing
and all too eager. “He asked if there was an airport near me and if I could
meet the next day,” Cantrell said. “My red flags started going off.” Fearing
one of his enemies was trying to orchestrate an elaborate setup, Cantrell
told Musk to meet him at the Salt Lake City airport, where he would rent a
conference room near the Delta lounge. “I wanted him to meet me behind
security so he couldn’t pack a gun,” Cantrell said. When the meeting finally
took place, Musk and Cantrell hit it off. Musk rolled out his “humans need
to become a multiplanetary species” speech, and Cantrell said that if Musk
was really serious, he’d be willing to go to Russia—again—and help buy a
rocket.
In late October 2001, Musk, Cantrell, and Adeo Ressi, Musk’s friend
from college, boarded a commercial flight to Moscow. Ressi had been
playing the role of Musk’s guardian and trying to ascertain whether his best
friend had started to lose his mind. Compilation videos of rockets exploding
were made, and interventions were held with Musk’s friends trying to talk
him out of wasting his money. While these measures failed, Adeo went
along to Russia to try to contain Musk as best as he could. “Adeo would call
me to the side and say, ‘What Elon is doing is insane. A philanthropic
gesture? That’s crazy,’” Cantrell said. “He was seriously worried but was
down with the trip.” And why not? The men were heading to Russia at the
height of its freewheeling post-Soviet days when rich guys could apparently
buy space missiles on the open market.
Team Musk would grow to include Mike Griffin, and meet with the
Russians three times over a period of four months.* The group set up a few
meetings with companies like NPO Lavochkin, which had made probes
intended for Mars and Venus for the Russian Federal Space Agency, and
Kosmotras, a commercial rocket launcher. The appointments all seemed to
go the same way, following Russian decorum. The Russians, who often skip
breakfast, would ask to meet around 11 A.M. at their offices for an early
lunch. Then there would be small talk for an hour or more as the meeting
attendees picked over a spread of sandwiches, sausages, and, of course,
vodka. At some point during this process, Griffin usually started to lose his
patience. “He suffers fools very poorly,” Cantrell said. “He’s looking
around and wondering when we’re going to get down to fucking business.”
The answer was not soon. After lunch came a lengthy smoking and coffeedrinking
period. Once all of the tables were cleared, the Russian in charge
would turn to Musk and ask, “What is it you’re interested in buying?” The
big windup may not have bothered Musk as much if the Russians had taken
him more seriously. “They looked at us like we were not credible people,”
Cantrell said. “One of their chief designers spit on me and Elon because he
thought we were full of shit.”
The most intense meeting occurred in an ornate, neglected,
prerevolutionary building near downtown Moscow. The vodka shots started
—“To space!” “To America!”—while Musk sat on $20 million, which he
hoped would be enough to buy three ICBMs that could be retooled to go to
space. Buzzed from the vodka, Musk asked point-blank how much a missile
would cost. The reply: $8 million each. Musk countered, offering $8 million
for two. “They sat there and looked at him,” Cantrell said. “And said
something like, ‘Young boy. No.’ They also intimated that he didn’t have
the money.” At this point, Musk had decided the Russians were either not
serious about doing business or determined to part a dot-com millionaire
from as much of his money as possible. He stormed out of the meeting.
The Team Musk mood could not have been worse. It was near the end
of February 2002, and they went outside to hail a cab and drove straight to
the airport surrounded by the snow and dreck of the Moscow winter. Inside
the cab, no one talked. Musk had come to Russia filled with optimism about
putting on a great show for mankind and was now leaving exasperated and
disappointed by human nature. The Russians were the only ones with
rockets that could possibly fit within Musk’s budget. “It was a long drive,”
Cantrell said. “We sat there in silence looking at the Russian peasants
shopping in the snow.” The somber mood lingered all the way to the plane,
until the drink cart arrived. “You always feel particularly good when the
wheels lift off in Moscow,” Cantrell said. “It’s like, ‘My God. I made it.’
So, Griffin and I got drinks and clinked our glasses.” Musk sat in the row in
front of them, typing on his computer. “We’re thinking, Fucking nerd. What
can he be doing now?” At which point Musk wheeled around and flashed a
spreadsheet he’d created. “Hey, guys,” he said, “I think we can build this
rocket ourselves.”
Griffin and Cantrell had downed a couple of drinks by this time and
were too deflated to entertain a fantasy. They knew all too well the stories
of gung-ho millionaires who thought they could conquer space only to lose
their fortunes. Just the year before, Andrew Beal, a real estate and finance
whiz in Texas, folded his aerospace company after having poured millions
into a massive test site. “We’re thinking, Yeah, you and whose fucking
army,” Cantrell said. “But, Elon says, ‘No, I’m serious. I have this
spreadsheet.’” Musk passed his laptop over to Griffin and Cantrell, and they
were dumbfounded. The document detailed the costs of the materials
needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk’s
calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a
modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized
in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. The
spreadsheet also laid out the hypothetical performance characteristics of the
rocket in fairly impressive detail. “I said, ‘Elon, where did you get this?’”
Cantrell said.
Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics
behind it. From Cantrell and others, he’d borrowed Rocket Propulsion
Elements, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, and Aerothermodynamics of
Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion, along with several more seminal texts.
Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and
had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets
could and should be made much cheaper than what the Russians were
offering. Forget the mice. Forget the plant with its own video feed growing
—or possibly dying—on Mars. Musk would inspire people to think about
exploring space again by making it cheaper to explore space.
As word traveled around the space community about Musk’s plans,
there was a collective ho-hum. People like Zubrin had seen this show many
times before. “There was a string of zillionaires that got sold a good story
by an engineer,” Zubrin said. “Combine my brains and your money, and we
can build a rocket ship that will be profitable and open up the space frontier.
The techies usually ended up spending the rich guy’s money for two years,
and then the rich guy gets bored and shuts the thing down. With Elon,
everyone gave a sigh and said, ‘Oh well. He could have spent ten million
dollars to send up the mice, but instead he’ll spend hundreds of millions and
probably fail like all the others that proceeded him.’”
While well aware of the risks tied to starting a rocket company, Musk
had at least one reason to think he might succeed where others had failed.
That reason’s name was Tom Mueller.
Mueller grew up the son of a logger in the tidy Idaho town of St.
Maries, where he developed a reputation as an oddball. While the rest of the
kids were outside exploring the woods in winter, Mueller stayed warm in
the library reading books or watching Star Trek at his house. He also
tinkered. Walking to grade school one day, Mueller discovered a smashed
clock in an alley and turned it into a pet project. Each day, he fixed some
part of the clock—a gear, a spring—until he got it working. A similar thing
happened with the family’s lawn mower, which Mueller disassembled one
afternoon on the front lawn for fun. “My dad came home and was so mad
because he thought he’d have to buy a new mower,” Mueller said. “But I
put it back together, and it ran.” Mueller then got stuck on rockets. He
started buying mail order kits and following the instructions to build small
rockets. Rather quickly, Mueller graduated to constructing his own devices.
At the age of twelve, he crafted a mock-up space shuttle that could be
attached to a rocket, sent up into the air, and then glide back to the ground.
For a science project a couple of years later, Mueller borrowed his dad’s
oxyacetylene welding equipment to make a rocket engine prototype.
Mueller cooled the device by placing it upside down in a coffee can full of
water—“I could run it like that all day long”—and invented equally creative
ways to measure its performance. The machine was good enough for
Mueller to win a couple of regional science fair competitions and end up at
an international event. “That’s where I promptly got my ass kicked,”
Mueller said.
Tall, lanky, and with a rectangular face, Mueller is an easygoing sort
who muddled through college for a bit, teaching his friends how to make
smoke bombs, and then eventually settled down and did well as a
mechanical engineering student. Fresh out of college, he worked for Hughes
Aircraft on satellites—“It wasn’t rockets, but it was close”—and then went
to TRW Space & Electronics. It was the latter half of the 1980s, and Ronald
Reagan’s Star Wars program had the space gearheads dreaming about
kinetic weapons and all sorts of mayhem. At TRW, Mueller experimented
with crazy types of propellants and oversaw the development of the
company’s TR-106 engine, a giant machine fueled by liquid oxygen and
hydrogen. As a hobby, Mueller hung out with a couple hundred amateur
rocketry buffs in the Reaction Research Society, a group formed in 1943 to
encourage the building and firing of rockets. On the weekends, Mueller
traveled out to the Mojave Desert with the other RRS members to push the
limits of amateur machines. Mueller was one of the club’s standouts, able to
build things that actually worked, and could experiment with some of the
more radical concepts that were quashed by his conservative bosses at
TRW. His crowning achievement was an eighty-pound engine that could
produce thirteen thousand pounds of thrust and earned accolades as the
world’s largest liquid-fuel rocket engine built by an amateur. “I still keep
the rockets hanging in my garage,” Mueller said.
In January 2002, Mueller was hanging out in the workshop of John
Garvey, who had left a job at the aerospace company McDonnell Douglas
to start building his own rockets. Garvey’s facility was in Huntington
Beach, where he rented an industrial space about the size of a six-car
garage. The two men were fiddling around with the eighty-pound engine
when Garvey mentioned that a guy named Elon Musk might be stopping by.
The amateur rocketry scene is tight, and it was Cantrell who recommended
that Musk check out Garvey’s workshop and see Mueller’s designs. On a
Sunday, Musk arrived with a pregnant Justine, wearing a stylish black
leather trench coat and looking like a high-paid assassin. Mueller had the
eighty-pound engine on his shoulder and was trying to bolt it to a support
structure when Musk began peppering him with questions. “He asked me
how much thrust it had,” Mueller said. “He wanted to know if I had ever
worked on anything bigger. I told him that yeah, I’d worked on a 650,000-
pound thrust engine at TRW and knew every part of it.” Mueller set the
engine down and tried to keep up with Musk’s interrogation. “How much
would that big engine cost?” Musk asked. Mueller told him TRW built it for
about $12 million. Musk shot back, “Yeah, but how much could you really
do it for?”
Mueller ended up chatting with Musk for hours. The next weekend,
Mueller invited Musk to his house to continue their discussion. Musk knew
he had found someone who really knew the ins and outs of making rockets.
After that, Musk introduced Mueller to the rest of his roundtable of space
experts and their stealthy meetings. The caliber of the people impressed
Mueller, who had turned down past job offers from Beal and other budding
space magnates because of their borderline insane ideas. Musk, by contrast,
seemed to know what he was doing, weeding out the naysayers meeting by
meeting and forming a crew of bright, committed engineers.
Mueller had helped Musk fill out that spreadsheet around the
performance and cost metrics of a new, low-cost rocket, and, along with the
rest of Team Musk, had subsequently refined the idea. The rocket would not
carry truck-sized satellites like some of the monster rockets flown by
Boeing, Lockheed, the Russians, and others countries. Instead, Musk’s
rocket would be aimed at the lower end of the satellite market, and it could
end up as ideal for an emerging class of smaller payloads that capitalized on
the massive advances that had taken place in recent years in computing and
electronics technology. The rocket would cater directly to a theory in the
space industry that a whole new market might open for both commercial
and research payloads if a company could drastically lower the price per
launch and perform launches on a regular schedule. Musk relished the idea
of being at the forefront of this trend and developing the workhorse of a
new era in space. Of course, all of this was theoretical—and then, suddenly,
it wasn’t. PayPal had gone public in February with its shares shooting up 55
percent, and Musk knew that eBay wanted to buy the company as well.
While noodling on the rocket idea, Musk’s net worth had increased from
tens of millions to hundreds of millions. In April 2002, Musk fully
abandoned the publicity-stunt idea and committed to building a commercial
space venture. He pulled aside Cantrell, Griffin, Mueller, and Chris
Thompson, an aerospace engineer at Boeing, and told the group, “I want to
do this company. If you guys are in, let’s do it.” (Griffin wanted to join but
ended up declining when Musk rebuffed his request to live on the East
Coast, and Cantrell only stuck around for a few months after this meeting,
seeing the venture as too risky.)
Founded in June 2002, Space Exploration Technologies came to life in
humble settings. Musk acquired an old warehouse at 1310 East Grand
Avenue in El Segundo, a suburb of Los Angeles humming with the activity
of the aerospace industry. The previous tenant of the 75,000-square-foot
building had done lots of shipping and had used the south side of the facility
as a logistics depot, outfitting it with several receiving bays for delivery
trucks. This allowed Musk to drive his silver McLaren right into the
building. Beyond that the surroundings were sparse—just a dusty floor and
a forty-foot-high ceiling with its wooden beams and insulation exposed and
which curved at the top to give the place a hangarlike feel. The north side of
the building was an office space with cubicles and room for about fifty
people. During the first week of SpaceX’s operations, delivery trucks
showed up packed full of Dell laptops and printers and folding tables that
would serve as the first desks. Musk walked over to one of the loading
docks, rolled up the door, and off-loaded the equipment himself.
Musk had soon transformed the SpaceX office with what has become
his signature factory aesthetic: a glossy epoxy coating applied over concrete
on the floors, and a fresh coat of white paint slathered onto the walls. The
white color scheme was intended to make the factory look clean and feel
cheerful. Desks were interspersed around the factory so that Ivy League
computer scientists and engineers designing the machines could sit with the
welders and machinists building the hardware. This approach stood as
SpaceX’s first major break with traditional aerospace companies that prefer
to cordon different engineering groups off from each other and typically
separate engineers and machinists by thousands of miles by placing their
factories in locations where real estate and labor run cheap.
As the first dozen or so employees came to the offices, they were told
that SpaceX’s mission would be to emerge as the “Southwest Airlines of
Space.” SpaceX would build its own engines and then contract with
suppliers for the other components of the rocket. The company would gain
an edge over the competition by building a better, cheaper engine and by
fine-tuning the assembly process to make rockets faster and cheaper than
anyone else. This vision included the construction of a type of mobile
launch vehicle that could travel to various sites, take the rocket from a
horizontal to vertical position, and send it off to space—no muss, no fuss.
SpaceX was meant to get so good at this process that it could do multiple
launches a month, make money off each one, and never need to become a
huge contractor dependent on government funds.
SpaceX was to be America’s attempt at a clean slate in the rocket
business, a modernized reset. Musk felt that the space industry had not
really evolved in about fifty years. The aerospace companies had little
competition and tended to make supremely expensive products that
achieved maximum performance. They were building a Ferrari for every
launch, when it was possible that a Honda Accord might do the trick. Musk,
by contrast, would apply some of the start-up techniques he’d learned in
Silicon Valley to run SpaceX lean and fast and capitalize on the huge
advances in computing power and materials that had taken place over the
past couple of decades. As a private company, SpaceX would also avoid the
waste and cost overruns associated with government contractors. Musk
declared that SpaceX’s first rocket would be called the Falcon 1, a nod to
Star Wars’ Millennium Falcon and his role as the architect of an exciting
future. At a time when the cost of sending a 550-pound payload started at
$30 million, he promised that the Falcon 1 would be able to carry a 1,400-
pound payload for $6.9 million.
Bowing to his nature, Musk set an insanely ambitious timeline for all of
this. One of the earliest SpaceX presentations suggested that the company
would complete its first engine in May 2003, a second engine in June, the
body of the rocket in July, and have everything assembled in August. A
launchpad would then be prepared by September, and the first launch would
take place in November 2003, or about fifteen months after the company
started. A trip to Mars was naturally slated for somewhere near the end of
the decade. This was Musk the logical, naïve optimist tabulating how long it
should take people physically to perform all of this work. It’s the baseline
he expects of himself and one that his employees, with their human foibles,
are in a never-ending struggle to match.
As space enthusiasts started to learn about the new company, they didn’t
really obsess over whether Musk’s delivery schedule sounded realistic or
not. They were just thrilled that someone had decided to take the cheap and
fast approach. Some members of the military had already been promoting
the idea of giving the armed forces more aggressive space capabilities, or
what they called “responsive space.” If a conflict broke out, the military
wanted the ability to respond with purpose-built satellites for that mission.
This would mean moving away from a model where it takes ten years to
build and deploy a satellite for a specific job. Instead, the military desired
cheaper, smaller satellites that could be reconfigured through software and
sent up on short notice, almost like disposable satellites. “If we could pull
that off, it would be really game-changing,” said Pete Worden, a retired air
force general, who met with Musk while serving as a consultant to the
Defense Department. “It could make our response in space similar to what
we do on land, sea and in the air.” Worden’s job required him to look at
radical technologies. While many of the people he encountered came off as
eccentric dreamers, Musk seemed grounded, knowledgeable, and capable.
“I talked to people building ray guns and things in their garages. It was
clear that Elon was different. He was a visionary who really understood the
rocket technology, and I was impressed with him.”
Like the military, scientists wanted cheap, quick access to space and the
ability to send up experiments and get data back on a regular basis. Some
companies in the medical and consumer-goods industries were also
interested in rides to space to study how a lack of gravity affected the
properties of their products.
As good as a cheap launch vehicle sounded, the odds of a private citizen
building one that worked were beyond remote. A quick search on YouTube
for “rocket explosions” turns up thousands of compilation videos
documenting U.S. and Soviet launch disasters that have occurred over the
decades. From 1957 to 1966, the United States alone tried to blast more
than 400 rockets into orbit and about 100 of them crashed and burned.5 The
rockets used to transport things to space are mostly modified missiles
developed through all of this trial and error and funded by billions upon
billions of government dollars. SpaceX had the advantage of being able to
learn from this past work and having a few people on staff that had
overseen rocket projects at companies like Boeing and TRW. That said, the
start-up did not have a budget that could support a string of explosions. At
best, SpaceX would have three or four shots at making the Falcon 1 work.
“People thought we were just crazy,” Mueller said. “At TRW, I had an army
of people and government funding. Now we were going to make a low-cost
rocket from scratch with a small team. People just didn’t think it could be
done.”
In July 2002, Musk was gripped by the excitement of this daring
enterprise, and eBay made its aggressive move to buy PayPal for $1.5
billion. This deal gave Musk some liquidity and supplied him with more
than $100 million to throw at SpaceX. With such a massive up-front
investment, no one would be able to wrestle control of SpaceX away from
Musk as they had done at Zip2 and PayPal. For the employees who had
agreed to accompany Musk on this seemingly impossible journey, the
windfall provided at least a couple of years of job security. The acquisition
also upped Musk’s profile and celebrity, which he could leverage to score
meetings with top government officials and to sway suppliers.
And then all of a sudden none of this seemed to matter. Justine had
given birth to a son—Nevada Alexander Musk. He was ten weeks old
when, just as the eBay deal was announced, he died. The Musks had tucked
Nevada in for a nap and placed the boy on his back as parents are taught to
do. When they returned to check on him, he was no longer breathing and
had suffered from what the doctors would term a sudden infant death
syndrome–related incident. “By the time the paramedics resuscitated him,
he had been deprived of oxygen for so long that he was brain-dead,” Justine
wrote in her article for Marie Claire. “He spent three days on life support in
a hospital in Orange County before we made the decision to take him off it.
I held him in my arms when he died. Elon made it clear that he did not want
to talk about Nevada’s death. I didn’t understand this, just as he didn’t
understand why I grieved openly, which he regarded as ‘emotionally
manipulative.’ I buried my feelings instead, coping with Nevada’s death by
making my first visit to an IVF clinic less than two months later. Elon and I
planned to get pregnant again as swiftly as possible. Within the next five
years, I gave birth to twins, then triplets.” Later, Justine chalked up Musk’s
reaction to a defense mechanism that he’d learned from years of suffering
as a kid. “He doesn’t do well in dark places,” she told Esquire magazine.
“He’s forward-moving, and I think it’s a survival thing with him.”
Musk did open up to a couple of close friends and expressed the depth
of his misery. But for the most part, Justine read her husband right. He
didn’t see the value in grieving publicly. “It made me extremely sad to talk
about it,” Musk said. “I’m not sure why I’d want to talk about extremely
sad events. It does no good for the future. If you’ve got other kids and
obligations, then wallowing in sadness does no good for anyone around
you. I’m not sure what should be done in such situations.”
Following Nevada’s death, Musk threw himself at SpaceX and rapidly
expanded the company’s goals. His conversations with aerospace
contractors around possible work for SpaceX left Musk disenchanted. It
sounded like they all charged a lot of money and worked slowly. The plan
to integrate components made by these types of companies gave way to the
decision to make as much as practical right at SpaceX. “While drawing
upon the ideas of many prior launch vehicle programs from Apollo to the
X-34/Fastrac, SpaceX is privately developing the entire Falcon rocket from
the ground up, including both engines, the turbo-pump, the cryogenic tank
structure and the guidance system,” the company announced on its website.
“A ground up internal development increases difficulty and the required
investment, but no other path will achieve the needed improvement in the
cost of access to space.”
The SpaceX executives Musk hired were an all-star crew. Mueller set to
work right away building the two engines—Merlin and Kestrel, named after
two types of falcons. Chris Thompson, a onetime marine who had managed
the production of the Delta and Titan rockets at Boeing, joined as the vice
president of operations. Tim Buzza also came from Boeing, where he’d
earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading rocket testers. Steve
Johnson, who had worked at JPL and at two commercial space companies,
was tapped as the senior mechanical engineer. The aerospace engineer Hans
Koenigsmann came on to develop the avionics, guidance, and control
systems. Musk also recruited Gwynne Shotwell, an aerospace veteran who
started as SpaceX’s first salesperson and rose in the years that followed to
be president and Musk’s right-hand woman.
These early days also marked the arrival of Mary Beth Brown, a nowlegendary
character in the lore of both SpaceX and Tesla. Brown—or MB,
as everyone called her—became Musk’s loyal assistant, establishing a reallife
version of the relationship between Iron Man’s Tony Stark and Pepper
Potts. If Musk worked a twenty-hour day, so too did Brown. Over the years,
she brought Musk meals, set up his business appointments, arranged time
with his children, picked out his clothes, dealt with press requests, and
when necessary yanked Musk out of meetings to keep him on schedule. She
would emerge as the only bridge between Musk and all of his interests and
was an invaluable asset to the companies’ employees.
Brown played a key role in developing SpaceX’s early culture. She paid
attention to small details like the office’s red spaceship trash cans and
helped balance the vibe around the office. When it came to matters related
directly to Musk, Brown put on her firm countenance and no-nonsense
attitude. The rest of the time she usually had a warm, broad smile and a
disarming charm. “It was always, ‘Oh, dear. How are you, dear?’” recalled
a SpaceX technician. Brown collected the weird e-mails that arrived for
Musk and sent them out as “Kook of the Week” missives to make people
laugh. One of the better entries included a pencil sketch of a lunar
spacecraft that had a red spot on the page. The person who sent in the letter
had circled the spot on his own drawing and then written “What is that?
Blood?” next to it. In other letters there were plans for a perpetual motion
machine and a proposal for a giant inflatable rabbit that could be used to
plug oil spills. For a short time, Brown’s duties extended to managing
SpaceX’s books and handling the flow of business in Musk’s absence. “She
pretty much called the shots,” the technician said. “She would say, ‘This is
what Elon would want.’”
Her greatest gift, though, may have been reading Musk’s moods. At
both SpaceX and Tesla, Brown placed her desk a few feet in front of
Musk’s, so that people had to pass her before having a meeting with him. If
someone needed to request permission to buy a big-ticket item, they would
stop for a moment in front of Brown and wait for a nod to go see Musk or
the shake-off to go away because Musk was having a bad day. This system
of nods and shakes became particularly important during periods of
romantic strife for Musk, when his nerves were on edge more than usual.
The rank-and-file engineers at SpaceX tended to be young, male
overachievers. Musk would personally reach out to the aerospace
departments of top colleges and inquire about the students who had finished
with the best marks on their exams. It was not unusual for him to call the
students in their dorm rooms and recruit them over the phone. “I thought it
was a prank call,” said Michael Colonno, who heard from Musk while
attending Stanford. “I did not believe for a minute that he had a rocket
company.” Once the students looked Musk up on the Internet, selling them
on SpaceX was easy. For the first time in years if not decades, young
aeronautics whizzes who pined to explore space had a really exciting
company to latch on to and a path toward designing a rocket or even
becoming an astronaut that did not require them to join a bureaucratic
government contractor. As word of SpaceX’s ambitions spread, top
engineers from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital Sciences with a high
tolerance for risk fled to the upstart, too.
Throughout the first year at SpaceX, one or two new employees joined
almost every week. Kevin Brogan was employee No. 23 and came from
TRW, where he’d been used to various internal policies blocking him from
doing work. “I called it the country club,” he said. “Nobody did anything.”
Brogan started at SpaceX the day after his interview and was told to go
hunting in the office for a computer to use. “It was go to Fry’s and get
whatever you need and go to Staples and get a chair,” Brogan said. He
immediately felt in over his head and would work for twelve hours, drive
home, sleep for ten hours, and then head right back to the factory. “I was
exhausted and out of shape mentally,” he said. “But soon I loved it and got
totally hooked.”
One of the first projects SpaceX decided to tackle was the construction
of a gas generator, a machine not unlike a small rocket engine that produces
hot gas. Mueller, Buzza, and a couple of young engineers assembled the
generator in Los Angeles and then packed it into the back of a pickup truck
and drove it out to Mojave, California, to test it. A desert town about one
hundred miles from Los Angeles, Mojave had become a hub for aerospace
companies like Scaled Composites and XCOR. A lot of the aerospace
projects were based out of the Mojave airport, where companies had their
workshops and sent up all manner of cutting-edge airplanes and rockets.
The SpaceX team fit right into this environment and borrowed a test stand
from XCOR that was just about the perfect size to hold the gas generator.
The first ignition run took place at 11 A.M. and lasted ninety seconds. The
gas generator worked, but it had let out a billowing black smoke cloud that
on this windless day parked right over the airport tower. The airport
manager came down to the test area and lit into Mueller and Buzza. The
airport official and some of the guys from XCOR who had been helping out
urged the SpaceX engineers to take it easy and wait until the next day to run
another test. Instead, Buzza a strong leader ready to put SpaceX’s relentless
ethos into play, coordinated a couple of trucks to pick up more fuel, talked
the airport manager down, and got the test stand ready for another fire. In
the days that followed, SpaceX’s engineers perfected a routine that let them
do multiple tests a day—an unheard-of practice at the airport—and had the
gas generator tuned to their liking after two weeks of work.
They made a few more trips to Mojave and some other spots, including
a test stand at Edwards Air Force Base and another in Mississippi. While on
this countrywide rocketry tour, the SpaceX engineers came across a threehundred-
acre test site in McGregor, Texas, a small city near the center of
the state. They really liked this spot, and talked Musk into buying it. The
navy had tested rockets on the land years before and so too had Andrew
Beal before his aerospace company collapsed. “After Beal saw it was going
to cost him $300 million to develop a rocket capable of sending sizeable
satellites into orbit, he called it quits, leaving behind a lot of useful
infrastructure for SpaceX, including a three-story concrete tripod with legs
as big around as redwood tree trunks,” wrote journalist Michael Belfiore in
Rocketeers, a book that captured the rise of a handful of private space
companies.
Jeremy Hollman was one of the young engineers who soon found
himself living in Texas and customizing the test site to SpaceX’s needs.
Hollman exemplified the kind of recruit Musk wanted: he’d earned an
aerospace engineering degree from Iowa State University and a master’s in
astronautical engineering from the University of Southern California. He’d
spent a couple of years working as a test engineer at Boeing dealing with
jets, rockets, and spacecraft.*
The stint at Boeing had left Hollman unimpressed with big aerospace.
His first day on the job came right as Boeing completed its merger with
McDonnell Douglas. The resultant mammoth government contractor held a
picnic to boost morale but ended up failing at even this simple exercise.
“The head of one of the departments gave a speech about it being one
company with one vision and then added that the company was very cost
constrained,” Hollman said. “He asked that everyone limit themselves to
one piece of chicken.” Things didn’t improve much from there. Every
project at Boeing felt large, cumbersome, and costly. So, when Musk came
along selling radical change, Hollman bit. “I thought it was an opportunity I
could not pass up,” he said. At twenty-three, Hollman was young, single,
and willing to give up any semblance of having a life in favor of working at
SpaceX nonstop, and he became Mueller’s second in command.
Mueller had developed a pair of three-dimensional computer models of
the two engines he wanted to build. Merlin would be the engine for the first
stage of the Falcon 1, which lifted it off the ground, and Kestrel would be
the smaller engine used to power the upper, second stage of the rocket and
guide it in space. Together, Hollman and Mueller figured out which parts of
the engines SpaceX would build at the factory and which parts it would try
to buy. For the purchased parts, Hollman had to head out to various
machine shops and get quotes and delivery dates for the hardware. Quite
often, the machinists told Hollman that SpaceX’s timelines were nuts.
Others were more accommodating and would try to bend an existing
product to SpaceX’s needs instead of building something from scratch.
Hollman also found that creativity got him a long way. He discovered, for
example, that changing the seals on some readily available car wash valves
made them good enough to be used with rocket fuel.
After SpaceX completed its first engine at the factory in California,
Hollman loaded it and mounds of other equipment into a U-Haul trailer. He
hitched the U-Haul to the back of a white Hummer H2 and drove four
thousand pounds of gear* across Interstate 10 from Los Angeles to Texas
and the test site. The arrival of the engine in Texas kicked off one of the
great bonding exercises in SpaceX’s history. Amid rattlesnakes, fire ants,
isolation, and searing heat, the group led by Buzza and Mueller began the
process of exploring every intricacy of the engines. It was a high-pressure
slog full of explosions—or what the engineers politely called “rapid
unscheduled disassemblies”—that would determine whether a small band of
engineers really could match the effort and skill of nation-states. The
SpaceX employees christened the site in fitting fashion, downing a $1,200
bottle of Rémy Martin cognac out of paper cups and passing a sobriety test
on the drive back to the company apartments in the Hummer. From that
point on, the trek from California to the test site became known as the Texas
Cattle Haul. The SpaceX engineers would work for ten days straight, come
back to California for a weekend, and then head back. To ease the burden of
travel, Musk sometimes let them use his private jet. “It carried six people,”
Mueller said. “Well, seven if someone sat in the toilet, which happened all
the time.”
While the navy and Beal had left some testing apparatus, SpaceX had to
build a large amount of custom gear. One of the largest of these structures
was a horizontal test stand about 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 15 feet tall.
Then there was the complementary vertical test stand that stood two stories
high. When an engine needed to be fired, it would be fastened to one of the
test stands, outfitted with sensors to collect data, and monitored via several
cameras. The engineers took shelter in a bunker protected on one side by a
dirt embankment. If something went wrong, they would look at feeds from
the webcams or slowly lift one of the bunker’s hatches to listen for any
clues. The locals in town rarely complained about the noise, although the
animals on nearby farms seemed less impressed. “Cows have this natural
defense mechanism where they gather and start running in a circle,”
Hollman said. “Every time we fired an engine, the cows scattered and then
got in that circle with the younger ones placed in the middle. We set up a
cow cam to watch them.”
Both Kestrel and Merlin came with challenges, and they were treated as
alternating engineering exercises. “We would run Merlin until we ran out of
hardware or did something bad,” Mueller said. “Then we’d run Kestrel and
there was never a shortage of things to do.” For months, the SpaceX
engineers arrived at the site at 8 A.M. and spent twelve hours there working
on the engines before retiring to the Outback Steakhouse for dinner. Mueller
had a particular knack for looking over test data and spotting some place
where the engine ran hot or cold or had another flaw. He would call
California and prescribe hardware changes, and engineers would refashion
parts and send them off to Texas. Often the workers in Texas modified parts
themselves using a mill and lathe that Mueller had brought out. “Kestrel
started out as a real dog, and one of my proudest moments was taking it
from terrible to great performance with stuff we bought online and did in
the machine shop,” Mueller said. Some members of the Texas crew honed
their skills to the point that they could build a test-worthy engine in three
days. These same people were required to be adept at software. They’d pull
an all-nighter building a turbo pump for the engine and then dig in the next
night to retool a suite of applications used to control the engines. Hollman
did this type of work all the time and was an all-star, but he was not alone
among this group of young, nimble engineers who crossed disciplines out of
necessity and the spirit of adventure. “There was an almost addictive quality
to the experience,” Hollman said. “You’re twenty-four or twenty-five, and
they’re trusting you with so much. It was very empowering.”
To get to space, the Merlin engine would need to burn for 180 seconds.
That seemed like an eternity for the engineers at the outset of their stint in
Texas, when the engine would burn for only a half second before it conked
out. Sometimes Merlin vibrated too much during the tests. Sometimes it
responded badly to a new material. Sometimes it cracked and needed major
part upgrades, like moving from an aluminum manifold to a manifold made
out of the more exotic Inconel, an alloy suited to extreme temperatures. On
one occasion, a fuel valve refused to open properly and caused the whole
engine to blow up. Another test gone wrong ended up with the whole test
stand burning down. It usually came to Buzza and Mueller to make the
unpleasant call back to Musk and recap the day’s foibles. “Elon had pretty
good patience,” Mueller said. “I remember one time we had two test stands
running and blew up two things in one day. I told Elon we could put another
engine on there, but I was really, really frustrated and just tired and mad and
was kinda short with Elon. I said, ‘We can put another fucking thing on
there, but I’ve blown up enough shit today.’ He said, ‘Okay, all right, that’s
fine. Just calm down. We’ll do it again tomorrow.’” Coworkers in El
Segundo later reported that Musk had been near tears during this call after
hearing the frustration and agony in Mueller’s voice.
What Musk would not tolerate were excuses or the lack of a clear plan
of attack. Hollman was one of many engineers who arrived at this
realization after facing one of Musk’s trademark grillings. “The worst call
was the first one,” Hollman said. “Something had gone wrong, and Elon
asked me how long it would take to be operational again, and I didn’t have
an immediate answer. He said, ‘You need to. This is important to the
company. Everything is riding on this. Why don’t you have an answer?’ He
kept hitting me with pointed, direct questions. I thought it was more
important to let him know quickly what happened, but I learned it was more
important to have all the information.”
From time to time, Musk participated in the testing process firsthand.
One of the more memorable examples of this came as SpaceX tried to
perfect a cooling chamber for its engines. The company had bought several
of these chambers at $75,000 a pop and needed to put them under pressure
with water to gauge their ability to handle stress. During the initial test, one
of the pricey chambers cracked. Then the second one broke in the same
place. Musk ordered a third test, as the engineers looked on in horror. They
thought the test might be putting the chamber under undue stress and that
Musk was burning through essential equipment. When the third chamber
cracked, Musk flew the hardware back to California, took it to the factory
floor, and, with the help of some engineers, started to fill the chambers with
an epoxy to see if it would seal them. “He’s not afraid to get his hands
dirty,” Mueller said. “He’s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes
and has epoxy all over him. They were there all night and tested it again and
it broke anyway.” Musk, clothes ruined, had decided the hardware was
flawed, tested his hypothesis, and moved on quickly, asking the engineers to
come up with a new solution.
These incidents were all part of a trying but productive process. SpaceX
had developed the feeling of a small, tight-knit family up against the world.
In late 2002, the company had an empty warehouse. One year later, the
facility looked like a real rocket factory. Working Merlin engines were
arriving back from Texas, and being fed into an assembly line where
machinists could connect them to the main body, or first stage, of the
rocket. More stations were set up to link the first stage with the upper stage
of the rocket. Cranes were placed on the floor to handle the heavy lifting of
components, and blue metal transport tracks were positioned to guide the
rocket’s body through the factory from station to station. SpaceX had also
started to build the fairing, or case, that protects payloads atop the rocket
during launch and then opens up like a clam in space to let out the cargo.
SpaceX had picked up a customer as well. According to Musk, its first
rocket would launch in “early 2004” from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
carrying a satellite called TacSat-1 for the Department of Defense. With this
goal looming, twelve-hour days, six days a week were considered the norm,
although many people worked longer than that for extended periods of time.
Respites, as far as they existed, came around 8 P.M. on some weeknights
when Musk would allow everyone to use their work computers to play firstperson-
shooter video games like Quake III Arena and Counter-Strike
against each other. At the appointed hour, the sound of guns loading would
cascade throughout the office as close to twenty people armed themselves
for battle. Musk—playing under the handle Random9—often won the
games, talking trash and blasting away his employees without mercy. “The
CEO is there shooting at us with rockets and plasma guns,” said Colonno.
“Worse, he’s almost alarmingly good at these games and has insanely fast
reactions. He knew all the tricks and how to sneak up on people.”
The pending launch ignited Musk’s salesman instincts. He wanted to
show the public what his tireless workers had accomplished and drum up
some excitement around SpaceX. Musk decided to unveil a prototype of
Falcon 1 to the public in December 2003. The company would haul the
seven-story-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and
leave it—and the SpaceX mobile launch system—outside of the Federal
Aviation Administration’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. An
accompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a
modern, smarter, cheaper rocket maker had arrived.
This marketing song and dance didn’t sound sensible to SpaceX’s
engineers. They were working more than one hundred hours per week to
make the actual rocket that SpaceX would need to be in business. Musk
wanted them to do that and build a slick-looking mock-up. Engineers were
called back from Texas and assigned another ulcer-inducing deadline to
craft this prop. “In my mind, it was a boondoggle,” Hollman said. “It wasn’t
advancing anything. In Elon’s mind, it would get us a lot of backing from
important people in the government.”
While making the prototype for the event, Hollman experienced the full
spectrum of highs and lows that came with working for Musk. The engineer
had lost his regular glasses weeks earlier when they slipped off his face and
fell down a flame duct at the Texas test site. Hollman had since made do by
wearing an old pair of prescription safety glasses,* but they too were ruined
when he scratched the lenses while trying to duck under an engine at the
SpaceX factory. Without a spare moment to visit an optometrist, Hollman
started to feel his sanity fray. The long hours, the scratch, the publicity stunt
—they were all too much.
He vented about this in the factory one night, unaware that Musk stood
nearby and could hear everything. Two hours later, Mary Beth Brown
appeared with an appointment card to see a Lasik eye surgery specialist.
When Hollman visited the doctor, he discovered that Musk had already
agreed to pay for the surgery. “Elon can be very demanding, but he’ll make
sure the obstacles in your way are removed,” Hollman said. Upon
reflection, he also warmed to the long-term thinking behind Musk’s
Washington plan. “I think he wanted to add an element of realism to
SpaceX, and if you park a rocket in someone’s front yard, it’s hard to deny
it,” Hollman said.
The event in Washington ended up being well received, and just a few
weeks after it took place, SpaceX made another astonishing announcement.
Despite not having even flown a rocket yet, SpaceX revealed plans for a
second rocket. Along with the Falcon 1, it would build the Falcon 5. Per the
name, this rocket would have five engines and could carry more weight—
9,200 pounds—to low orbit around Earth. Crucially, the Falcon 5 could also
theoretically reach the International Space Station for resupply missions—a
capability that would open up SpaceX for some large NASA contracts. And,
in a nod to Musk’s obsession with safety, the rocket was said to be able to
complete its missions even if three of the five engines failed, which was a
level of added reliability that had not been seen in the market in decades.
The only way to keep up with all of this work was to do what SpaceX
had promised from the beginning: operate in the spirit of a Silicon Valley
start-up. Musk was always looking for brainy engineers who had not just
done well at school but had done something exceptional with their talents.
When he found someone good, Musk was relentless in courting him or her
to come to SpaceX. Bryan Gardner, for example, first met Musk at a space
rave in the hangars at the Mojave airport and a short while later started
talking about a job. Gardner was having some of his academic work
sponsored by Northrop Grumman. “Elon said, ‘We’ll buy them out,’”
Gardner said. “So, I e-mailed him my resume at two thirty A.M., and he
replied back in thirty minutes addressing everything I put in there point by
point. He said, ‘When you interview make sure you can talk concretely
about what you do rather than use buzzwords.’ It floored me that he would
take the time to do this.” After being hired, Gardner was tasked with
improving the system for testing the valves on the Merlin engine. There
were dozens of valves, and it took three to five hours to manually test each
one. Six months later, Gardner had built an automated system for testing the
valves in minutes. The testing machine tracked the valves individually, so
that an engineer in Texas could request what the metrics had been on a
specific part. “I had been handed this redheaded stepchild that no one else
wanted to deal with and established my engineering credibility,” Gardner
said. As the new hires arrived, SpaceX moved beyond its original building to
fill up several buildings in the El Segundo complex. The engineers were
running demanding software and rendering large graphics files and needed
high-speed connections between all of these offices. But SpaceX had
neighbors who were blocking an initiative to connect all of its buildings via
fiber optic lines. Instead of taking the time to haggle with the other
companies for right of way, the IT chief Branden Spikes, who had worked
with Musk at Zip2 and PayPal, came up with a quicker, more devious
solution. A friend of his worked for the phone company and drew a diagram
that demonstrated a way to squeeze a networking cable safely between the
electricity, cable, and phone wires on a telephone pole. At 2 A.M., an off-thebooks
crew showed up with a cherry picker and ran fiber to the telephone
poles and then ran cables straight to the SpaceX buildings. “We did that
over a weekend instead of taking months to get permits,” Spikes said.
“There was always this feeling that we were facing a sort of insurmountable
challenge and that we had to band together to fight the good fight.”
SpaceX’s landlord, Alex Lidow, chuckled when thinking back to all of the
antics of Musk’s team. “I know they did a lot of hanky stuff at night,” he
said. “They were smart, needed to get things done, and didn’t always have
time to wait for things like city permits.”
Musk never relented in asking his employees to do more and be better,
whether it was at the office or during extracurricular activities. Part of
Spikes’s duties included building custom gaming PCs for Musk’s home that
pushed their computational power to the limits and needed to be cooled
with water running through a series of tubes inside the machines. When one
of these gaming rigs kept breaking, Spikes figured out that Musk’s mansion
had dirty power lines and had a second, dedicated power circuit built for the
gaming room to correct the problem. Doing this favor bought Spikes no
special treatment. “SpaceX’s mail server crashed one time, and Elon word
for word said, ‘Don’t ever fucking let that happen again,’” Spikes said. “He
had a way of looking at you—a glare—and would keep looking at you until
you understood him.”
Musk had tried to find contractors that could keep up with SpaceX’s
creativity and pace. Instead of always hitting up aerospace guys, for
example, he located suppliers with similar experience from different fields.
Early on, SpaceX needed someone to build the fuel tanks, essentially the
main body of the rocket, and Musk ended up in the Midwest talking to
companies that had made large, metal agricultural tanks used in the dairy
and food processing businesses. These suppliers also struggled to keep up
with SpaceX’s schedule, and Musk found himself flying across the country
to pay visits—sometimes surprise ones—on the contractors to check on
their progress. One such inspection took place at a company in Wisconsin
called Spincraft. Musk and a couple of SpaceX employees flew his jet
across the country and arrived late at night expecting to see a shift of
workers doing extra duty to get the fuel tanks completed. When Musk
discovered that Spincraft was well behind schedule, he turned to a Spincraft
employee and informed him, “You’re fucking us up the ass, and it doesn’t
feel good.” David Schmitz was a general manager at Spincraft and said
Musk earned a reputation as a fearsome negotiator who did indeed follow
up on things personally. “If Elon was not happy, you knew it,” Schmitz said.
“Things could get nasty.” In the months that followed that meeting, SpaceX
increased its internal welding capabilities so that it could make the fuel
tanks in El Segundo and ditch Spincraft.
Another salesman flew down to SpaceX to sell the company on some
technology infrastructure equipment. He was doing the standard
relationship-building exercise practiced by salespeople for centuries. Show
up. Speak for a while. Feel each other out. Then, start doing business down
the road. Musk was having none of it. “The guy comes in, and Elon asks
him why they’re meeting,” Spikes said. “He said, ‘To develop a
relationship.’ Elon replied, ‘Okay. Nice to meet you,’ which basically
meant, ‘Get the fuck out of my office.’ This guy had spent four hours
traveling for what ended up as a two-minute meeting. Elon just has no
tolerance for that kind of stuff.” Musk could be equally brisk with
employees who were not hitting his standards. “He would often say, ‘The
longer you wait to fire someone the longer it has been since you should
have fired them,’” Spikes said.
Most of the SpaceX employees were thrilled to be part of the company’s
adventure and tried not to let Musk’s grueling demands and harsh behavior
get to them. But there were some moments where Musk went too far. The
engineering corps flew into a collective rage every time they caught Musk
in the press claiming to have designed the Falcon rocket more or less by
himself. Musk also hired a documentary crew to follow him around for a
while. This audacious gesture really grated on the people toiling away in the
SpaceX factory. They felt like Musk’s ego had gotten the best of him and
that he was presenting SpaceX as the conqueror of the aerospace industry
when the company had yet to launch successfully. Employees who made
detailed cases around what they saw as flaws in the Falcon 5 design or
presented practical suggestions to get the Falcon 1 out the door more
quickly were often ignored or worse. “The treatment of staff was not good
for long stretches of this era,” said one engineer. “Many good engineers,
who everyone beside ‘management’ felt were assets to the company, were
forced out or simply fired outright after being blamed for things they hadn’t
done. The kiss of death was proving Elon wrong about something.”
Early 2004, when SpaceX had hoped to launch its rocket, came and
went. The Merlin engine that Mueller and his team had built appeared to be
among the most efficient rocket engines ever made. It was just taking longer
than Musk had expected to pass tests needed to clear the engine for a
launch. Finally, in the fall of 2004, the engines were burning consistently
and meeting all their requirements. This meant that Mueller and his team
could breathe easy and that everyone else at SpaceX should prepare to
suffer. Mueller had spent SpaceX’s entire existence as the “critical path”—
the person holding up the company from achieving its next steps—working
under Musk’s scrutiny. “With the engine ready, it was time for mass panic,”
Mueller said. “No one else knew what it was like to be on critical path.”
Lots of people soon found out, as major problems abounded. The
avionics, which included the electronics for the navigation, communication,
and overall management of the rocket, turned into a nightmare. Seemingly
trivial things like getting a flash storage drive to talk to the rocket’s main
computer failed for undetectable reasons. The software needed to manage
the rocket also became a major burden. “It’s like anything else where you
find out that the last ten percent is where all the integration happens and
things don’t play together,” Mueller said. “This process went on for six
months.” Finally, in May 2005, SpaceX transported the rocket 180 miles
north to Vandenberg Air Force Base for a test fire and completed a fivesecond
burn on the launchpad.
Launching from Vandenberg would have been very convenient for
SpaceX. The site is close to Los Angeles and has several launchpads to pick
from. SpaceX, though, became an unwelcome guest. The air force gave the
newcomer a cool welcome, and the people assigned to manage the launch
sites did not go out of their way help SpaceX. Lockheed and Boeing, which
fly $1 billion spy satellites for the military from Vandenberg, didn’t care for
SpaceX’s presence, either—in part because SpaceX represented a threat to
their business and in part because this startup was mucking around near
their precious cargo. As SpaceX started to move from the testing phase to
the launch, it was told to get in line. They would have to wait months to
launch. “Even though they said we could fly, it was clear that we would
not,” said Gwynne Shotwell.
Searching for a new site, Shotwell and Hans Koenigsmann put a
Mercator projection of the world up on the wall and looked for a name they
recognized along the equator, where the planet spins faster and gives
rockets an added boost. The first name that jumped out was Kwajalein
Island—or Kwaj—the largest island in an atoll between Guam and Hawaii
in the Pacific Ocean and part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. This
spot registered with Shotwell because the U.S. Army had used it for
decades as a missile test site. Shotwell looked up the name of a colonel at
the test site and sent him an e-mail, and three weeks later got a call back
with the army saying they would love to have SpaceX fly from the islands.
In June 2005, SpaceX’s engineers began to fill containers with their
equipment to ship them to Kwaj.
About one hundred islands make up the Kwajalein Atoll. Many of them
stretch for just a few hundred yards and are much longer than they are wide.
“From the air, the place looks like these beautiful beads on a string,” said
Pete Worden, who visited the site in his capacity as a Defense Department
consultant. Most of the people in the area live on an island called Ebeye,
while the U.S. military has taken over Kwajalein, the southernmost island,
and turned it into part tropical paradise and part Dr. Evil’s secret lair. The
United States spent years lobbing its ICBMs from California at Kwaj and
used the island to run experiments on its space weapons during the “Star
Wars” period. Laser beams would be aimed at Kwaj from space in a bid to
see if they were accurate and responsive enough to take out an ICBM
hurtling toward the islands. The military presence resulted in a weird array
of buildings including hulking, windowless trapezoidal concrete structures
clearly conceived by someone who deals with death for a living.
To get to Kwaj, the SpaceX employees either flew on Musk’s jet or took
commercial flights through Hawaii. The main accommodations were twobedroom
affairs on Kwajalein Island that looked more like dormitories than
hotel rooms, with their military-issued dressers and desks. Any materials
that the engineers needed had to be flown in on Musk’s plane or were more
often brought by boat from Hawaii or the mainland United States. Each day,
the SpaceX crew gathered their gear and took a forty-five-minute boat ride
to Omelek, a seven-acre, palm-tree-and vegetation-covered island that
would be transformed into their launchpad. Over the course of several
months, a small team of people cleared the brush, poured concrete to
support the launchpad, and converted a double-wide trailer into offices. The
work was grueling and took place in soul-sapping humidity under a sun
powerful enough to burn the skin through a T-shirt. Eventually, some of the
workers preferred to spend the night on Omelek rather than make the
journey through rough waters back to the main island. “Some of the offices
were turned into bedrooms with mattresses and cots,” Hollman said. “Then
we shipped over a very nice refrigerator and a good grill and plumbed in a
shower. We tried to make it less like camping and more like living.”
The sun rose at 7 A.M. each day, and that’s when the SpaceX team got to
work. A series of meetings would take place with people listing what
needed to get done, and debating solutions to lingering problems. As the
large structures arrived, the workers placed the body of the rocket
horizontally in a makeshift hangar and spent hours melding together all of
its parts. “There was always something to do,” Hollman said. “If the engine
wasn’t a problem, then there was an avionics problem or a software
problem.” By 7 P.M., the engineers wound down their work. “One or two
people would decide it was their night to cook, and they would make steak
and potatoes and pasta,” Hollman said. “We had a bunch of movies and a
DVD player, and some of us did a lot of fishing off the docks.” For many of
the engineers, this was both a torturous and magical experience. “At Boeing
you could be comfortable, but that wasn’t going to happen at SpaceX,” said
Walter Sims, a SpaceX tech expert who found time to get certified to dive
while on Kwaj. “Every person on that island was a fucking star, and they
were always holding seminars on radios or the engine. It was such an
invigorating place.”
The engineers were constantly baffled by what Musk would fund and
what he wouldn’t. Back at headquarters, someone would ask to buy a
$200,000 machine or a pricey part that they deemed essential to Falcon 1’s
success, and Musk would deny the request. And yet he was totally
comfortable paying a similar amount to put a shiny surface on the factory
floor to make it look nice. On Omelek, the workers wanted to pave a twohundred-
yard pathway between the hangar and the launchpad to make it
easier to transport the rocket. Musk refused. This left the engineers moving
the rocket and its wheeled support structure in the fashion of the ancient
Egyptians. They laid down a series of wooden planks and rolled the rocket
across them, grabbing the last piece of wood from the back and running it
forward in a continuous cycle.
The whole situation was ludicrous. A start-up rocket company had
ended up in the middle of nowhere trying to pull off one of the most
difficult feats known to man, and, truth be told, only a handful of the
SpaceX team had any idea how to make a launch happen. Time and again,
the rocket would get marched out to the launchpad and hoisted vertical for a
couple of days, while technical and safety checks would reveal a litany of
new problems. The engineers worked on the rocket for as long as they could
before laying it horizontal and marching it back to the hangar to avoid
damage from the salty air. Teams that had worked separately for months
back at the SpaceX factory—propulsion, avionics, software—were thrust
together on the island and forced to become an interdisciplinary whole. The
sum total was an extreme learning and bonding exercise that played like a
comedy of errors. “It was like Gilligan’s Island except with rockets,”
Hollman said.
In November 2005, about six months after they had first gotten to the
island, the SpaceX team felt ready to give launching a shot. Musk flew in
with his brother, Kimbal, and joined the majority of the SpaceX team in the
barracks on Kwaj. On November 26, a handful of people woke up at 3 A.M.
and filled the rocket with liquid oxygen. They then scampered off to an
island about three miles away for protection, while the rest of the SpaceX
team monitored the launch systems from a control room twenty-six miles
away on Kwaj. The military gave SpaceX a six-hour launch window.
Everyone was hoping to see the first stage take off and reach about 6,850
miles per hour before giving way to the second stage, which would ignite
up in the air and reach 17,000 miles per hour. But, while going through the
pre-launch checks, the engineers detected a major problem: a valve on a
liquid oxygen tank would not close, and the LOX was boiling off into the
air at 500 gallons per hour. SpaceX scrambled to fix the issue but lost too
much of its fuel to launch before the window closed.
With that mission aborted, SpaceX ordered major LOX reinforcements
from Hawaii and prepared for another attempt in mid-December. High
winds, faulty valves, and other errors thwarted that launch attempt. Before
another attempt could be made, SpaceX discovered on a Saturday night that
the rocket’s power distribution systems had started malfunctioning and
would need new capacitors. On Sunday morning, the rocket was lowered
and split into its two stages so that a technician could slide in and remove
the electrical boards. Someone found an electronics supplier that was open
on Sunday in Minnesota, and off a SpaceX employee flew to get some fresh
capacitors. By Monday he was in California and testing the parts at
SpaceX’s headquarters to make sure they passed various heat and vibration
checks, then on a plane again back to the islands. In under eighty hours, the
electronics had been returned in working order and installed in the rocket.
The dash to the United States and back showed that SpaceX’s thirty-person
team had real pluck in the face of adversity and inspired everyone on the
island. A traditional three-hundred-person-strong aerospace launch crew
would never have tried to fix a rocket like that on the fly. But the energy,
smarts, and resourcefulness of the SpaceX team still could not overcome
their inexperience or the difficult conditions. More problems arose and
blocked any thoughts of a launch.
Finally, on March 24, 2006, it was all systems go. The Falcon 1 stood
on its square launchpad and ignited. It soared into the sky, turning the island
below it into a green spec amid a vast, blue expanse. In the control room,
Musk paced as he watched the action, wearing shorts, flip-flops, and a Tshirt.
Then, about twenty-five seconds in, it became clear that all was not
well. A fire broke out above the Merlin engine and suddenly this machine
that had been flying straight and true started to spin and then tumble
uncontrollably back to Earth. The Falcon 1 ended up falling directly down
onto the launch site. Most of the debris went into a reef 250 feet from the
launchpad, and the satellite cargo smashed through SpaceX’s machine shop
roof and landed more or less intact on the floor. Some of the engineers put
on their snorkeling and scuba gear and recovered the pieces, fitting all of
the rocket’s remnants into two refrigerator-sized crates. “It is perhaps worth
noting that those launch companies that succeeded also took their lumps
along the way,” Musk wrote in a postmortem. “A friend of mine wrote to
remind me that only 5 of the first 9 Pegasus launches succeeded; 3 of 5 for
Ariane; 9 of 20 for Atlas; 9 of 21 for Soyuz; and 9 of 18 for Proton. Having
experienced firsthand how hard it is to reach orbit, I have a lot of respect for
those that persevered to produce the vehicles that are mainstays of space
launch today.” Musk closed the letter writing, “SpaceX is in this for the
long haul and, come hell or high water, we are going to make this work.”
Musk and other SpaceX executives blamed the crash on an unnamed
technician. They said this technician had done some work on the rocket one
day before the launch and failed to properly tighten a fitting on a fuel pipe,
which caused the fitting to crack. The fitting in question was something
basic—an aluminum b-nut that’s often used to connect a pair of tubes. The
technician was Hollman. In the aftermath of the rocket crash, Hollman flew
to Los Angeles to confront Musk directly. He’d spent years working day
and night on the Falcon 1 and felt enraged that Musk had called out him and
his team in public. Hollman knew that he’d fastened the b-nut correctly and
that observers from NASA had been looking over his shoulder to check the
work. When Hollman charged into SpaceX’s headquarters with a head full
of fury, Mary Beth Brown tried to calm him and stop him from seeing
Musk. Hollman kept going anyway, and the two of them proceeded to have
a shouting match at Musk’s cubicle.
After all the debris was analyzed, it turned out that the b-nut had almost
certainly cracked due to corrosion from the months in Kwaj’s salty
atmosphere. “The rocket was literally crusted with salt on one side, and you
had to scrape it off,” Mueller said. “But we had done a static fire three days
earlier, and everything was fine.” SpaceX had tried to save about fifty
pounds of weight by using aluminum components instead of stainless steel.
Thompson, the former marine, had seen the aluminum parts work just fine
in helicopters that sat on aircraft carriers, and Mueller had seen aircraft
resting outside of Cape Canaveral for forty years with aluminum b-nuts in
fine condition. Years later, a number of SpaceX’s executives still agonize
over the way Hollman and his team were treated. “They were our best guys,
and they kind of got blamed to get an answer out to the world,” Mueller
said. “That was really bad. We found out later that it was dumb luck.”*
After the crash, there was a lot of drinking at a bar on the main island.
Musk wanted to launch again within six months, but putting together a new
machine would again require an immense amount of work. SpaceX had
some pieces for the vehicle ready in El Segundo but certainly not a readyto-
fire rocket. As they downed drinks, the engineers vowed to take a more
disciplined approach with their next craft and to work better as a collective.
Worden hoped the SpaceX engineers would raise their game as well. He’d
been observing them for the Defense Department and loved the energy of
the young engineers but not their methodology. “It was being done like a
bunch of kids in Silicon Valley would do software,” Worden said. “They
would stay up all night and try this and try that. I’d seen hundreds of these
types of operations, and it struck me that it wouldn’t work.” Leading up to
the first launch, Worden tried to caution Musk, sending a letter to him and
the director of DARPA, the research arm of the Defense Department, that
made his views clear. “Elon didn’t react well. He said, ‘What do you know?
You’re just an astronomer,’” Worden said. But, after the rocket blew up,
Musk recommended that Worden perform an investigation for the
government. “I give Elon huge credit for that,” Worden said.
Almost exactly a year later, SpaceX was ready to try another launch. On
March 15, 2007, a successful test fire took place. Then, on March 21, the
Falcon 1 finally behaved. From its launchpad surrounded by palm trees, the
Falcon 1 surged up and toward space. It flew for a couple of minutes with
engineers now and again reporting that the systems were “nominal,” or in
good shape. At three minutes into the flight, the first stage of the rocket
separated and fell back to Earth, and the Kestrel engine kicked in as planned
to carry the second stage into orbit. Ecstatic cheers went out in the control
room. Next, at the four-minute mark, the fairing atop the rocket separated as
planned. “It was doing exactly what it was supposed to do,” said Mueller. “I
was sitting next to Elon and looked at him and said, ‘We’ve made it.’ We’re
hugging and believe it’s going to make it to orbit. Then, it starts to wiggle.”
For more than five glorious minutes, the SpaceX engineers got to feel like
they had done everything right. A camera on board the Falcon 1 pointed
down and showed Earth getting smaller and smaller as the rocket made its
way methodically into space. But then that wiggle that Mueller noticed
turned into flailing, and the machine swooned, started to break apart, and
then blew up. This time the SpaceX engineers were quick to figure out what
went wrong. As the propellant was consumed, what was left started to move
around the tank and slosh against the sides, much like wine spinning around
a glass. The sloshing propellant triggered the wobbling, and at one point it
sloshed enough to leave an opening to the engine exposed. When the engine
sucked in a big breath of air, it flamed out.
The failure was another crushing blow to SpaceX’s engineers. Some of
them had spent close to two years shuffling back and forth between
California, Hawaii, and Kwaj. By the time SpaceX could attempt another
launch, it would be about four years after Musk’s original target, and the
company had been chewing through his Internet fortune at a worrying rate.
Musk had vowed publicly that he would see this thing through to the end,
but people inside and outside the company were doing back-of-theenvelope
math and could tell that SpaceX likely could only afford one more
attempt—maybe two. To the extent that the financial situation unnerved
Musk, he rarely if ever let it show to employees. “Elon did a great job of not
burdening people with those worries,” said Spikes. “He always
communicated the importance of being lean and of success, but it was never
‘if we fail, we’re done for.’ He was very optimistic.”
The failures seemed to do little to curtail Musk’s vision for the future or
raise doubts about his capabilities. In the midst of the chaos, he took a tour
of the islands with Worden. Musk began thinking aloud about how the
islands could be unified into one landmass. He suggested that walls could
be built through the small channels between the islands, and the water could
be pumped out in the spirit of the manmade systems in the Netherlands.
Worden, also known for his out-there ideas, was attracted to Musk’s
bravado. “That he is thinking of this stuff is kind of cool,” Worden said.
“From that point on, he and I discussed settling Mars. It really impressed
me that this is a guy that thinks big.”

ALL ELECTRIC
J. B. STRAUBEL HAS A TWO-INCH-LONG SCAR that cuts across the
middle of his left cheek. He earned it in high school, during a chemistry
class experiment. Straubel whipped up the wrong concoction of chemicals,
and the beaker he was holding exploded, throwing off shards of glass, one
of which sliced through his face.
The wound lingers as a tinkerer’s badge of honor. It arrived near the end
of a childhood full of experimentation with chemicals and machines. Born
in Wisconsin, Straubel constructed a large chemistry lab in the basement of
his family’s home that included fume hoods and chemicals ordered,
borrowed, or pilfered. At thirteen, Straubel found an old golf cart at the
dump. He brought it back home and restored it to working condition, which
required him to rebuild the electric motor. It seemed that Straubel was
always taking something apart, sprucing it up, and putting it back together.
All of this fit into the Straubel family’s do-it-yourself traditions. In the late
1890s Straubel’s great-grandfather started the Straubel Machine Company,
which built one of the first internal combustion engines in the United States
and used it to power boats.
Straubel’s inquisitive spirit carried him west to Stanford University,
where he enrolled in 1994 intending to become a physicist. After flying
through the hardest courses he could take, Straubel concluded that majoring
in physics would not be for him. The advanced courses were too theoretical,
and Straubel liked to get his hands dirty. He developed his own major called
energy systems and engineering. “I wanted to take software and electricity
and use it to control energy,” Straubel said. “It was computing combined
with power electronics. I collected all the things I love doing in one place.”
There was no clean-technology movement at this time, but there were
companies dabbling with new uses for solar power and electric vehicles.
Straubel ended up hunting down these startups, hanging out in their garages
and pestering the engineers. He began tinkering once again on his own as
well in the garage of a house he shared with a half dozen friends. Straubel
bought a “piece of shit Porsche” for $1,600 and turned it into an electric car.
This meant that Straubel had to create a controller to manage the electric
motor, build a charger from scratch, and write the software that made the
entire machine work. The car set the world record for electric vehicle (EV)
acceleration, traveling a quarter mile in 17.28 seconds. “The thing I took
away was that the electronics were great, and you could get acceleration on
a shoestring budget, but the batteries sucked,” Straubel said. “It had a thirtymile
range, so I learned firsthand about some of the limitations of electric
vehicles.” Straubel gave his car a hybrid boost, building a gasoline-powered
contraption that could be towed behind the Porsche and used to recharge the
batteries. It was good enough for Straubel to drive the four hundred miles
down to Los Angeles and back.
By 2002, Straubel was living in Los Angeles. He’d gotten a master’s
degree from Stanford and bounced around a couple of companies looking
for something that called out to him. He decided on Rosen Motors, which
had built one of the world’s first hybrid vehicles—a car that ran off a
flywheel and a gas turbine and had electric motors to drive the wheel. After
it folded, Straubel followed Harold Rosen, an engineer famed for inventing
the geostationary satellite, to create an electric plane. “I’m a pilot and love
to fly, so this was perfect for me,” Straubel said. “The idea was that it would
stay aloft for two weeks at a time and hover over a specific spot. This was
way before drones and all that.” To help make ends meet, Straubel also
worked nights and on the weekend doing electronics consulting for a startup.
It was in the midst of toiling away on all these projects that Straubel’s
old buddies from the Stanford solar car team came to pay him a visit. A
group of rogue engineers at Stanford had been working on solar cars for
years, building them in a World War II–era Quonset hut full of toxic
chemicals and black widows. Unlike today, when the university would jump
at the chance to support such a project, Stanford tried to shut down this
group of fringe freaks and geeks. The students proved very capable of doing
the work on their own and competed in cross-country solar-powered car
races. Straubel helped build the vehicles during his time at university and
even after, forming relationships with the incoming crop of engineers. The
team had just raced 2,300 miles from Chicago to Los Angeles, and Straubel
offered the strapped, exhausted kids a place to stay. About a half dozen
students showed up at Straubel’s place, took their first showers in many
days, and then spread across his floor. As they chatted late into the night,
Straubel and the solar team kept fixating on one topic. They realized that
lithium ion batteries—such as the ones in their car being fed by the sun—
had gotten much better than most people realized. Many consumer
electronics devices like laptops were running on so-called 18650 lithium ion
batteries, which looked a lot like AA batteries and could be strung together.
“We wondered what would happen if you put ten thousand of the battery
cells together,” Straubel said. “We did the math and figured you could go
almost one thousand miles. It was totally nerdy shit, and eventually
everyone fell asleep, but the idea really stuck with me.”
Soon enough, Straubel was stalking the solar car crew, trying to talk
them into building an electric car based on the lithium ion batteries. He
would fly up to Palo Alto, spend the night sleeping in his plane, and then
ride a bicycle to the Stanford campus to make his sales pitch while helping
with their current projects. The design Straubel had come up with was a
super-aerodynamic vehicle with 80 percent of its mass made up of the
batteries. It looked quite a bit like a torpedo on wheels. No one knew the
exact details of Straubel’s long-term vision for this thing, including
Straubel. The plan seemed to be less about forming a car company than
about building a proof-of-concept vehicle just to get people thinking about
the power of the lithium ion batteries. With any luck, they would find a race
to compete in.
The Stanford students agreed to join Straubel, if he could raise some
money. He began going to trade shows handing out brochures about his idea
and e-mailing just about anyone he could think of. “I was shameless,” he
said. The only problem was that no one had any interest in what Straubel
was selling. Investors dealt him one rejection after another for months on
end. Then, in the fall of 2003, Straubel met Elon Musk.
Harold Rosen had set up a lunch with Musk at a seafood restaurant near
the SpaceX headquarters in Los Angeles and brought Straubel along to help
talk up the electric plane idea. When Musk didn’t bite on that, Straubel
announced his electric car side project. The crazy idea struck an immediate
chord with Musk, who had been thinking about electric vehicles for years.
While Musk had mostly focused on using ultracapacitors for the vehicles,
he was thrilled and surprised to hear how far the lithium ion battery
technology had progressed. “Everyone else had told me I was nuts, but Elon
loved the idea,” Straubel said. “He said, ‘Sure, I will give you some
money.’” Musk promised Straubel $10,000 of the $100,000 he was seeking.
On the spot, Musk and Straubel formed a kinship that would survive more
than a decade of extreme highs and lows as they set out to do nothing less
than change the world.
After the meeting with Musk, Straubel reached out to his friends at AC
Propulsion. The Los Angeles–based company started in 1992 and was the
bleeding edge of electric vehicles, building everything from zippy midsize
passenger jobs right on up to sports cars. Straubel really wanted to show
Musk the tzero (from “t-zero”)—the highest-end vehicle in AC Propulsion’s
stable. It was a type of kit car that had a fiberglass body sitting on top of a
steel frame and went from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds when
first unveiled in 1997. Straubel had spent years hanging out with the AC
Propulsion crew and asked Tom Gage, the company’s president, to bring a
tzero over for Musk to drive. Musk fell for the car. He saw its potential as a
screaming-fast machine that could shift the perception of electric cars from
boring and plodding to something aspirational. For months Musk offered to
fund an effort to transform the kit car into a commercial vehicle but got
rebuffed time and again. “It was a proof of concept and needed to be made
real,” Straubel said. “I love the hell out of the AC Propulsion guys, but they
were sort of hopeless at business and refused to do it. They kept trying to
sell Elon on this car called the eBox that looked like shit, didn’t have good
performance, and was just uninspiring.” While the meetings with AC
Propulsion didn’t result in a deal, they had solidified Musk’s interest in
backing something well beyond Straubel’s science project. In a late
February 2004 e-mail to Gage, Musk wrote, “What I’m going to do is figure
out the best choice of a high performance base car and electric powertrain
and go in that direction.”
Unbeknownst to Straubel, at about the same time, a couple of business
partners in Northern California had also fallen in love with the idea of
making a lithium ion battery powered car. Martin Eberhard and Marc
Tarpenning had founded NuvoMedia in 1997 to create one of the earliest
electronic book readers, called the Rocket eBook. The work at NuvoMedia
had given the men insight into cutting-edge consumer electronics and the
hugely improved lithium ion batteries used to power laptops and other
portable devices. While the Rocket eBook was too far ahead of its time and
not a major commercial success, it was innovative enough to attract the
attention of Gemstar International Group, which owned TV Guide and some
electronic programming guide technology. Gemstar paid $187 million to
acquire NuvoMedia in March 2000. Spoils in hand, the cofounders stayed
in touch after the deal. They both lived in Woodside, one of the wealthiest
towns in Silicon Valley, and chatted from time to time about what they
should tackle next. “We thought up some goofball things,” said Tarpenning.
“There was one plan for these fancy irrigation systems for farms and the
home based on smart water-sensing networks. But nothing really resonated,
and we wanted something more important.”
Eberhard was a supremely talented engineer with a do-gooder’s social
conscience. The United States’ repeated conflicts in the Middle East
bothered him, and like many other science-minded folks around 2000 he
had started to accept global warming as a reality. Eberhard began looking
for alternatives to gas-guzzling cars. He investigated the potential of
hydrogen fuel cells but found them lacking. He also didn’t see much point
in leasing something like the EV1 electric car from General Motors. What
did catch Eberhard’s interest, however, were the all-electric cars from AC
Propulsion that he spied on the Internet. Eberhard went down to Los
Angeles around 2001 to visit the AC Propulsion shop. “The place looked
like a ghost town and like they were going out of business,” Eberhard said.
“I bailed them out with five hundred thousand dollars so that they could
build one of their cars for me with lithium ion instead of lead acid
batteries.” Eberhard too tried to goad AC Propulsion into being a
commercial enterprise rather than a hobby shop. When they rejected his
overtures, Eberhard decided to form his own company and see what the
lithium ion batteries could really do.
Eberhard’s journey began with him building a technical model of the
electric car on a spreadsheet. This let him tweak various components and
see how they might affect the vehicle’s shape and performance. He could
adjust the weight, number of batteries, resistance of the tires and body, and
then get back answers on how many batteries it would take to power the
various designs. The models made it clear that SUVs, which were very
popular at the time, and things like delivery trucks were unlikely
candidates. The technology seemed instead to favor a lighter-weight, highend
sports car, which would be fast, fun to drive, and have far better range
than most people would expect. These technical specifications
complemented the findings of Tarpenning, who had been doing research
into a financial model for the car. The Toyota Prius had started to take off in
California, and it was being purchased by wealthy eco-crusaders. “We also
learned that the average income for EV1 owners was around two hundred
thousand dollars per year,” Tarpenning said. People who used to go after the
Lexus, BMW, and Cadillac brands saw electric and hybrid cars as a
different kind of status symbol. The men figured they could build
something for the $3 billion per year luxury auto market in the United
States that would let rich people have fun and feel good about themselves
too. “People pay for cool and sexy and an amazing zero-to-sixty time,”
Tarpenning said.
On July 1, 2003, Eberhard and Tarpenning incorporated their new
company. While at Disneyland a few months earlier on a date with his wife,
Eberhard had come up with the name Tesla Motors, both to pay homage to
the inventor and electric motor pioneer Nikola Tesla and because it sounded
cool. The cofounders rented an office that had three desks and two small
rooms in a decrepit 1960s building located at 845 Oak Grove Avenue in
Menlo Park. The third desk was occupied a few months later by Ian Wright,
an engineer who grew up on a farm in New Zealand. He was a neighbor of
the Tesla cofounders in Woodside, and had been working with them to hone
his pitch for a networking startup. When the start-up failed to raise any
money from venture capitalists, Wright joined Tesla. As the three men
began to tell some of their confidants of their plans, they were confronted
with universal derision. “We met a friend at this Woodside pub to tell her
what we had finally decided to do and that it was going to be an electric
car,” Tarpenning said. “She said, ‘You have to be kidding me.’”
Anyone who tries to build a car company in the United States is quickly
reminded that the last successful start-up in the industry was Chrysler,
founded in 1925. Designing and building a car from the ground up comes
with plenty of challenges, but it’s really getting the money and know-how
to build lots of cars that has thwarted past efforts to get a new company
going. The Tesla founders were aware of these realities. They figured that
Nikola Tesla had built an electric motor a century earlier and that creating a
drivetrain to take the power from the motor and send it to the wheels was
doable. The really frightening part of their enterprise would be building the
factory to make the car and its associated parts. But the more the Tesla guys
researched the industry, the more they realized that the big automakers
don’t even really build their cars anymore. The days of Henry Ford having
raw materials delivered to one end of his Michigan factory and then sending
cars out the other end had long passed. “BMW didn’t make its windshields
or upholstery or rearview mirrors,” Tarpenning said. “The only thing the big
car companies had kept was internal combustion research, sales and
marketing, and the final assembly. We thought naïvely that we could access
all the same suppliers for our parts.”
The plan the Tesla cofounders came up with was to license some
technology from AC Propulsion around the tzero vehicle and to use the
Lotus Elise chassis for the body of their car. Lotus, the English carmaker,
had released the two-door Elise in 1996, and it certainly had the sleek,
ground-hugging appeal to make a statement to high-end car buyers. After
talking to a number of people in the car dealership business, the Tesla team
decided to avoid selling their cars through partners and sell direct. With
these basics of a plan in place, the three men went hunting for some venture
capital funding in January 2004.
To make things feel more real for the investors, the Tesla founders
borrowed a tzero from AC Propulsion and drove it to the venture capital
corridor of Sand Hill Road. The car accelerated faster than a Ferrari, and
this translated into visceral excitement for the investors. The downside,
though, was that venture capitalists are not a terribly imaginative bunch,
and they struggled to see past the crappy plastic finish of this glorified kit
car. The only venture capitalists that bit were Compass Technology Partners
and SDL Ventures, and they didn’t sound altogether thrilled. The lead
partner at Compass had made out well on NuvoMedia and felt some loyalty
to Eberhard and Tarpenning. “He said, ‘This is stupid, but I have invested in
every automotive start-up for the last forty years, so why not,’” Tarpenning
recalled. Tesla still needed a lead investor who would pony up the bulk of
the $7 million needed to make what’s known as a mule or a prototype
vehicle. That would be their first milestone and give them something
physical to show off, which could aid a second round of funding.
Eberhard and Tarpenning had Elon Musk’s name in the back of their
heads as a possible lead investor from the outset. They had both seen him
speak a couple of years earlier at a Mars Society conference held at
Stanford where Musk had laid out his vision of sending mice into space,
and they got the impression that he thought a bit differently and would be
open to the idea of an electric car. The idea to pitch Musk on Tesla Motors
solidified when Tom Gage from AC Propulsion called Eberhard and told
him that Musk was looking to fund something in the electric car arena.
Eberhard and Wright flew down to Los Angeles and met with Musk on a
Friday. That weekend, Musk peppered Tarpenning, who had been away on a
trip, with questions about the financial model. “I just remember responding,
responding, and responding,” Tarpenning said. “The following Monday,
Martin and I flew down to meet him again, and he said, ‘Okay, I’m in.’”
The Tesla founders felt like they had lucked into the perfect investor.
Musk had the engineering smarts to know what they were building. He also
shared their larger goal of trying to end the United States’ addiction to oil.
“You need angel investors to have some belief, and it wasn’t a purely
financial transaction for him,” Tarpenning said. “He wanted to change the
energy equation of the country.” With an investment of $6.5 million, Musk
had become the largest shareholder of Tesla and the chairman of the
company. Musk would later wield his position of strength well while
battling Eberhard for control of Tesla. “It was a mistake,” Eberhard said. “I
wanted more investors. But, if I had to do it again, I would take his money.
A bird in the hand, you know. We needed it.”
Not long after this meeting took place, Musk called Straubel and urged
him to meet with the Tesla team. Straubel heard that their offices in Menlo
Park were about a half a mile from his house, and he was intrigued but very
skeptical of their story. No one on the planet was more dialed into the
electric vehicle scene than Straubel, and he found it hard to believe that a
couple of guys had gotten this far along without word of their project
reaching him. Nonetheless, Straubel stopped by the office for a meeting,
and was hired right away in May 2004 at a salary of $95,000 per year. “I
told them that I had been building the battery pack they need down the
street with funding from Elon,” Straubel said. “We agreed to join forces and
formed this ragtag group.”
Had anyone from Detroit stopped by Tesla Motors at this point, they
would have ended up in hysterics. The sum total of the company’s
automotive expertise was that a couple of the guys at Tesla really liked cars
and another one had created a series of science fair projects based on
technology that the automotive industry considered ridiculous. What’s
more, the founding team had no intention of turning to Detroit for advice on
how to build a car company. No, Tesla would do what every other Silicon
Valley start-up had done before it, which was hire a bunch of young, hungry
engineers and figure things out as they went along. Never mind that the Bay
Area had no real history of this model ever having worked for something
like a car and that building a complex, physical object had little in common
with writing a software application. What Tesla did have, ahead of anyone
else, was the realization that 18650 lithium ion batteries had gotten really
good and were going to keep getting better. Hopefully that coupled with
some effort and smarts would be enough.
Straubel had a direct pipeline into the smart, energetic engineers at
Stanford and told them about Tesla. Gene Berdichevsky, one of the
members of the solar-powered-car team, lit up the second he heard from
Straubel. An undergraduate, Berdichevsky volunteered to quit school, work
for free, and sweep the floors at Tesla if that’s what it took to get a job. The
founders were impressed with his spirit and hired Berdichevsky after one
meeting. This left Berdichevsky in the uncomfortable position of calling his
Russian immigrant parents, a pair of nuclear submarine engineers, to tell
them that he was giving up on Stanford to join an electric car start-up. As
employee No. 7, he spent part of the workday in the Menlo Park office and
the rest in Straubel’s living room designing three-dimensional models of the
car’s powertrain on a computer and building battery pack prototypes in the
garage. “Only now do I realize how insane it was,” Berdichevsky said.
Tesla soon needed to expand to accommodate its budding engineer army
and to create a workshop that would help bring the Roadster, as they were
now calling the car, to life. They found a two-story industrial building in
San Carlos at 1050 Commercial Street. The 10,000-square-foot facility
wasn’t much, but it had room to build a research and development shop
capable of knocking out some prototype cars. There were a couple of large
assembly bays on the ride side of the building and two large rollup doors
big enough for cars to drive in and out. Wright divided the open floor space
into segments—motors, batteries, power electronics, and final assembly.
The left half of the building was an office space that had been modified in
weird ways by the previous tenant, a plumbing supply company. The main
conference room had a wet bar and a sink where the faucet was a swan’s
mouth, and the hot and cold knobs were wings. Berdichevsky painted the
office white on a Sunday night, and the next week the employees made a
field trip to IKEA to buy desks and hopped online to order their computers
from Dell. As for tools, Tesla had a single Craftsman toolbox loaded with
hammers, nails, and other carpentry basics. Musk would visit now and
again from Los Angeles and was unfazed by the conditions, having seen
SpaceX grow up in similar surroundings.
The original plan for producing a prototype vehicle sounded simple.
Tesla would take the AC Propulsion tzero powertrain and fit it into the
Lotus Elise body. The company had acquired a schematic for an electric
motor design and figured it could buy a transmission from a company in the
United States or Europe and outsource any other parts from Asia. Tesla’s
engineers mostly needed to focus on developing the battery pack systems,
wiring the car, and cutting and welding metal as needed to bring everything
together. Engineers love to muck around with hardware, and the Tesla team
thought of the Roadster as something akin to a car conversion project that
could be done with two or three mechanical engineers, and a few assembly
people.
The main team of prototype builders consisted of Straubel,
Berdichevsky, and David Lyons, a very clever mechanical engineer and
employee No. 12. Lyons had about a decade of experience working for
Silicon Valley companies and had met Straubel a few years before when the
two men struck up a conversation at a 7-Eleven about an electric bike
Straubel was riding. Lyons had helped Straubel pay bills by hiring him as a
consultant for a company building a device to measure people’s core body
temperature. Straubel thought he could return the favor by bringing Lyons
on early to such an exciting project. Tesla would benefit in a big way as
well. As Berdichevsky put it, “Dave Lyons knew how to get shit done.”
The engineers bought a blue lift for the car and set it up inside the
building. They also purchased some machine tools, hand tools, and
floodlights to work at night and started to turn the facility into a hotbed of
R&D activity. Electrical engineers studied the Lotus’s base-level software
to figure out how it tied together the pedals, mechanical apparatus, and the
dashboard gauges. The really advanced work took place with the battery
pack design. No one had ever tried to combine hundreds of lithium ion
batteries in parallel, so Tesla ended up at the cutting edge of the technology.
The engineers started trying to understand how heat would dissipate and
current flow would behave across seventy batteries by supergluing them
together into groups called bricks. Then ten bricks would be placed
together, and the engineers would test various types of air and liquid
cooling mechanisms. When the Tesla team had developed a workable
battery pack, they stretched the yellow Lotus Elise chassis five inches and
lowered the pack with a crane into the back of the car, where its engine
would normally be. These efforts began in earnest on October 18, 2004,
and, rather remarkably, four months later, on January 27, 2005, an entirely
new kind of car had been built by eighteen people. It could even be driven
around. Tesla had a board meeting that day, and Musk zipped about in the
car. He came away happy enough to keep investing. Musk put in $9 million
more as Tesla raised a $13 million funding round. The company now
planned to deliver the Roadster to consumers in early 2006.
Once they’d finished building a second car a few months later, the
engineers at Tesla decided they needed to face up to a massive potential
flaw in their electric vehicle. On July 4, 2005, they were at Eberhard’s
house in Woodside celebrating Independence Day and figured it was as
good a moment as any to see what happened when the Roadster’s batteries
caught on fire. Someone taped twenty of the batteries together, put a heating
strip wire into the bundle, and set it off. “It went up like a cluster of bottle
rockets,” Lyons said. Instead of twenty batteries, the Roadster would have
close to 7,000, and the thought of what an explosion at that scale would be
like horrified the engineers. One of the perks of an electric car was meant to
be that it moved people away from a flammable liquid like gasoline and the
endless explosions that take place in an engine. Rich people were unlikely
to pay a high price for something even more dangerous, and the early
nightmare scenario for the employees at Tesla was that a rich, famous
person would get caught in a fire caused by the car. “It was one of those ‘oh
shit’ moments,” Lyons said. “That is when we really sobered up.”
Tesla formed a six-person task force to deal with the battery issue. They
were pulled off all other work and given money to begin running
experiments. The first explosions started taking place at the Tesla
headquarters, where the engineers filmed them in slow motion. Once saner
minds prevailed, Tesla moved its explosion research to a blast area behind
an electrical substation maintained by the fire department. Blast by blast,
the engineers learned a great deal about the inner workings of the batteries.
They developed methods for arranging them in ways that would prevent
fires spreading from one battery to the next and other techniques for
stopping explosions altogether. Thousands of batteries exploded along the
way, and the effort was worth it. It was still early days, for sure, but Tesla
was on the verge of inventing battery technology that would set it apart
from rivals for years to come and would become one of the company’s great
advantages.
The early success at building two prototype cars, coupled with Tesla’s
engineering breakthroughs around the batteries and other technological
pieces, boosted the company’s confidence. It was time to put Tesla’s stamp
on the vehicle. “The original plan had been to do the bare minimum we
could get away with as far as making the car stylistically different from a
Lotus but electric,” said Tarpenning. “Along the way, Elon and the rest of
the board said, ‘You only get to do this once. It has to delight the customer,
and the Lotus just isn’t good enough to do that.’”
The Elise’s chassis, or base frame, worked fine for Tesla’s engineering
purposes. But the body of the car had serious issues in both form and
function. The door on the Elise was all of a foot tall, and you were meant to
either jump into the car or fall into it, depending on your flexibility and/or
dignity. The body also needed to be longer to accommodate Tesla’s battery
pack and a trunk. And Tesla preferred to make the Roadster out of carbon
fiber instead of fiberglass. On these design points, Musk had a lot of
opinion and influence. He wanted a car that Justine could feel comfortable
getting into and that had some measure of practicality. Musk made these
opinions clear when he visited Tesla for board meetings and design reviews.
Tesla hired a handful of designers to mock up new looks for the
Roadster. After settling on a favorite, the company paid to build a quarterscale
model of the vehicle in January 2005 and then a full-scale model in
April. This process provided the Tesla executives with yet another
revelation of everything that went into making a car. “They wrap this shiny
Mylar material around the model and vacuum it, so that you can really see
the contours and shine and shadows,” Tarpenning said. The silver model
was then turned into a digital rendering that the engineers could manipulate
on their computers. A British company took the digital file and used it to
create a plastic version of the car called an “aero buck” for aerodynamics
testing. “They put it on a boat and shipped it to us, and then we took it to
Burning Man,” Tarpenning said, referring to the annual drug-infused art
festival held in the Nevada desert.
About a year later, after many tweaks and much work, Tesla had a
pencils-down moment. It was May 2006, and the company had grown to a
hundred employees. This team built a black version of the Roadster known
as EP1, or engineering prototype one. “It was saying, ‘We now think we
know what we will build,’” Tarpenning said. “You can feel it. It’s a real car,
and it’s very exciting.” The arrival of the EP1 provided a great excuse to
show existing investors what their money had bought and to ask for more
funds from a wider audience. The venture capitalists were impressed
enough to overlook the fact that engineers sometimes had to manually fan
the car to cool it down in between test drives and were now starting to grasp
Tesla’s long-term potential. Musk once again put money into Tesla—$12
million—and a handful of other investors, including the venture capital firm
Draper Fisher Jurvetson, VantagePoint Capital Partners, J.P. Morgan,
Compass Technology Partners, Nick Pritzker, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin,
joined the $40 million round.*
In July 2006, Tesla decided to tell the world what it had been up to. The
company’s engineers had built a red prototype—EP2—to complement the
black one, and they both went on display at an event in Santa Clara. The
press flocked to the announcement and were quite taken with what they
saw. The Roadsters were gorgeous, two-seater convertibles that could go
from zero to 60 in about four seconds. “Until today,” Musk said at the
event, “all electric cars have sucked.”6
Celebrities like then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former
Disney CEO Michael Eisner showed up at the event, and many of them
took test rides in the Roadsters. The vehicles were so fragile that only
Straubel and a couple of other trusted hands knew how to run them, and
they were swapped out every five minutes to avoid overheating. Tesla
revealed that each car would cost about $90,000 and had a range of 250
miles per charge. Thirty people, the company said, had committed to buying
a Roadster, including the Google cofounders Brin and Page and a handful of
other technology billionaires. Musk promised that a cheaper car—a fourseat,
four-door model under $50,000, would arrive in about three years.
Around the time of this event, Tesla made its debut in the New York
Times via a mini-profile on the company. Eberhard vowed—optimistically
—to begin shipments of the Roadster in the middle of 2007, instead of early
2006 as once planned, and laid out Tesla’s strategy of starting with a highpriced,
low-volume product and moving down to more affordable products
over time, as underlying technology and manufacturing capabilities
advanced. Musk and Eberhard were big believers in this strategy, having
seen it play out with a number of electronic devices. “Cellphones,
refrigerators, color TV’s, they didn’t start off by making a low-end product
for masses,” Eberhard told the paper.7 “They were relatively expensive, for
people who could afford it.” While the story was a coup for Tesla, Musk
didn’t appreciate being left out of the article entirely. “We tried to
emphasize him, and told the reporter about him over and over again, but
they weren’t interested in the board of the company,” Tarpenning said.
“Elon was furious. He was livid.”
You could understand why Musk might want some of the shine of Tesla
to rub off on him. The car had turned into a cause célèbre of the automotive
world. Electric vehicles tended to invoke religious overreactions from both
the pro and con camps, and the appearance of a good-looking, fast electric
car stoked everyone’s passions. Tesla had also turned Silicon Valley into a
real threat, at least conceptually, to Detroit for the first time. The month
after the Santa Monica event was the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, a
famous showcase for exotic cars. Tesla had become such a topic of
conversation that the organizers of the event begged to have a Roadster and
waived the usual display fees. Tesla set up a booth, and people showed up
by the dozens writing $100,000 checks on the spot to pre-order their cars.
“This was long before Kickstarter, and we just had not thought of trying to
do that,” Tarpenning said. “But then we started getting millions of dollars at
these types of events.” Venture capitalists, celebrities, and friends of Tesla
employees began trying to buy their way onto the waiting list. Some of
Silicon Valley’s wealthy elite went so far as to show up at the Tesla office
and knock on the door, looking to buy a car. The entrepreneurs Konstantin
Othmer and Bruce Leak, who had known Musk from his internship days at
Rocket Science Games, did just that one weekday and ended up getting a
personal tour of the car from Musk and Eberhard that stretched over a
couple of hours. “At the end we said, ‘We’ll take one,’” Othmer said. “They
weren’t actually allowed to sell cars yet, though, so we joined their club. It
cost one hundred thousand dollars, but one of the benefits of membership
was that you’d get a free car.”
As Tesla switched from marketing back into R&D mode, it had some
trends working in its favor. Advances in computing had made it so that
small car companies could sometimes punch at the same weight as the
giants of the industry. Years ago, automakers would have needed to make a
fleet of cars for crash testing. Tesla could not afford to do that, and it didn’t
have to. The third Roadster engineering prototype went to the same
collision testing facility used by large automakers, giving Tesla access to
top-of-the-line high-speed cameras and other imaging technology.
Thousands of other tests, though, were done by a third party that specialized
in computer simulations and saved Tesla from building a fleet of crash
vehicles. Tesla also had equal access to the big guys’ durability tracks made
out of cobblestones and concrete embedded with metal objects. It could
replicate 100,000 miles and ten years of wear at these facilities.
Quite often, the Tesla engineers brought their Silicon Valley attitude to
the automakers’ traditional stomping grounds. There’s a break and traction
testing track in northern Sweden near the Arctic Circle where cars get tuned
on large plains of ice. It would be standard to run the car for three days or
so, get the data, and return to company headquarters for many weeks of
meetings about how to adjust the car. The whole process of tuning a car can
take the entire winter. Tesla, by contrast, sent its engineers along with the
Roadsters being tested and had them analyze the data on the spot. When
something needed to be tweaked, the engineers would rewrite some code
and send the car back on the ice. “BMW would need to have a confab
between three or four companies that would all blame each other for the
problem,” Tarpenning said. “We just fixed it ourselves.” Another testing
procedure required that the Roadsters go into a special cooling chamber to
check how they would respond to frigid temperatures. Not wanting to pay
the exorbitant costs to use one of these chambers, the Tesla engineers opted
to rent an ice cream delivery truck with a large refrigerated trailer. Someone
would drive a Roadster into the truck, and the engineers would don parkas
and work on the car.
Every time Tesla interacted with Detroit it received a reminder of how
the once-great city had been separated from its own can-do culture. Tesla
tried to lease a small office in Detroit. The costs were incredibly low
compared with space in Silicon Valley, but the city’s bureaucracy made
getting just a basic office an ordeal. The building’s owner wanted to see
seven years of audited financials from Tesla, which was still a private
company. Then the building owner wanted two years’ worth of advanced
rent. Tesla had about $50 million in the bank and could have bought the
building outright. “In Silicon Valley, you say you’re backed by a venture
capitalist, and that’s the end of the negotiation,” Tarpenning said. “But
everything was like that in Detroit. We’d get FedEx boxes, and they
couldn’t even decide who should sign for the package.”
Throughout these early years, the engineers credited Eberhard with
making quick, crisp decisions. Rarely did Tesla get hung up overanalyzing a
situation. The company would pick a plan of attack, and when it failed at
something, it failed fast and then tried a new approach. It was many of the
changes that Musk wanted that started to delay the Roadster. Musk kept
pushing for the car to be more comfortable, asking for alterations to the
seats and the doors. He made the carbon-fiber body a priority, and he
pushed for electronic sensors on the doors so that the Roadster could be
unlocked with the touch of a finger instead of a tug on a handle. Eberhard
groused that these features were slowing the company down, and many of
the engineers agreed. “It felt at times like Elon was this unreasonably
demanding overarching force,” said Berdichevsky. “The company as a
whole was sympathetic to Martin because he was there all the time, and we
all felt the car should ship sooner.”
By the middle of 2007, Tesla had grown to 260 employees and seemed
to be pulling off the impossible. It had produced the fastest, most beautiful
electric car the world had ever seen almost from thin air. All it had to do
next was build a lot of the cars—a process that would end up almost
bankrupting the company.
The greatest mistake Tesla’s executives made in the early days were
assumptions around the transmission system for the Roadster. The goal had
always been to get from zero to 60 mph as quickly as possible in the hopes
that the raw speed of the Roadster would attract a lot of attention and make
it fun to drive. To do this, Tesla’s engineers had decided on a two-speed
transmission, which is the underlying mechanism in the car for transferring
power from the motor to the wheels. The first gear would take the car from
zero to 60 mph in less than four seconds, and then the second gear would
take the car up to 130 mph. Tesla had hired Xtrac, a British company
specializing in transmission designs, to build this part and had every reason
to believe that this would be one of the smoother bits of the Roadster’s
journey. “People had been making transmissions since Robert Fulton built
the steam engine,” said Bill Currie,8 a veteran Silicon Valley engineer and
employee No. 86 at Tesla. “We thought you would just order one. But the
first one we had lasted forty seconds.” The initial transmission could not
handle the big jump from the first to the second gear, and the fear was that
the second gear would engage at high speed and not be synchronized with
the motor properly, which would result in catastrophic damage to the car.
Lyons and the other engineers quickly set out to try to fix the issue.
They found a couple of other contractors to design replacements and again
hoped that these longtime transmission experts would deliver something
usable with relative ease. It soon became apparent, however, that the
contractors were not always putting their A team to work on this project for
a tiny start-up in Silicon Valley and that the new transmissions were no
better than the first. During tests, Tesla found that the transmissions would
sometimes break after 150 miles and that the mean time between failures
was about 2,000 miles. When a team from Detroit ran a root cause analysis
of the transmission to find failures, they discovered fourteen separate issues
that could cause the system to break. Tesla had wanted to deliver the
Roadster in November 2007, but the transmission issues lingered, and by
the time January 1, 2008, rolled around, the company had to once again
start from scratch, on a third transmission push.
Tesla also faced issues abroad. The company had decided to send a team
of its youngest, most energetic engineers to Thailand to set up a battery
factory. Tesla partnered with an enthusiastic although not totally capable
manufacturing partner. The Tesla engineers had been told that they could fly
over and manage the construction of a state-of-the-art battery factory.
Instead of a factory, they found a concrete slab with posts holding up a roof.
The building was about a three-hour drive south from Bangkok, and had
been left mostly open like many of the other factories because of the
incredible heat. The other manufacturing operations dealt with making
stoves, tires, and commodities that could withstand the elements. Tesla had
sensitive batteries and electronics, and like parts of the Falcon 1, they’d be
chewed up by the salty, humid conditions. Eventually, Tesla’s partner paid
about $75,000 to put in drywall, coat the floor, and create storage rooms
with temperature controls. Tesla’s engineers ended up working maddening
hours trying to train the Thai workers on how to handle the electronics
properly. The development of the battery technology, which had once
moved along at a rapid pace, slowed to a crawl.
The battery factory was one part of a supply chain that stretched across
the globe, adding cost and delays to the Roadster production. Body panels
for the car were to be made in France, while the motors were to come from
Taiwan. Tesla planned on buying battery cells in China and shipping them
to Thailand to turn the piece parts into battery packs. The battery packs,
which had to be stored for a minimal amount of time to avoid degradation,
would then be taken to port and shipped to England, where they needed to
clear customs. Tesla then planned for Lotus to build the body of the car,
attach the battery packs, and ship the Roadsters by boat around Cape Horn
to Los Angeles. In that scenario, Tesla would have paid for the bulk of the
car and had no chance to recognize revenue on the parts until six to nine
months had passed. “The idea was to get to Asia, get things done fast and
cheap, and make money on the car,” said Forrest North, one of the
engineers sent to Thailand. “What we found out was that for really
complicated things, you can do the work cheaper here and have less delays
and less problems.” When some new hires came on, they were horrified to
discover just how haphazard Tesla’s plan appeared. Ryan Popple, who had
spent four years in the army and then gotten an MBA from Harvard, arrived
at Tesla as a director of finance meant to prep the company to go public.
After examining the company’s books early in his tenure, Popple asked the
manufacturing and operations head exactly how he would get the car made.
“He said, ‘Well, we will decide we’re going into production and then a
miracle is going to happen,’” Popple said.
As word of the manufacturing issues reached Musk, he became very
concerned about the way Eberhard had run the company and called in a
fixer to address the situation. One of Tesla’s investors was Valor Equity, a
Chicago-based investment firm that specialized in fine-tuning
manufacturing operations. The company had been drawn to Tesla’s battery
and powertrain technology and calculated that even if Tesla failed to sell
many cars, the big automakers would end up wanting to buy its intellectual
property. To protect its investment, Valor sent in Tim Watkins, its managing
director of operations, and he soon reached some horrific conclusions.
Watkins is a Brit with degrees in industrial robotics and electrical
engineering. He’s built up a reputation as an ingenious solver of problems.
While doing work in Switzerland, for example, Watkins found a way to get
around the country’s rigid labor laws that limit the hours employees can
work, by automating a metal stamping factory so that it could run twentyfour
hours per day instead of sixteen hours like the factories or rivals.
Watkins is also known for keeping his ponytail in place with a black
scrunchie, wearing a black leather jacket, and toting a black fanny pack
everywhere he goes. The fanny pack has his passport, checkbook, earplugs,
sunscreen, food, and an assortment of other necessities. “It’s full of the
everyday things I need to survive,” said Watkins. “If I walk ten feet away
from this thing, I sense it.” While a bit eccentric, Watkins was thorough and
spent weeks talking to employees and analyzing every part of Tesla’s
supply chain to figure out how much it cost to make the Roadster.
Tesla had done a decent job of keeping its employee costs down. It hired
the kid fresh out of Stanford for $45,000 rather than the proven guy who
probably didn’t want to work that hard anyway for $120,000. But when it
came to equipment and materials, Tesla was a spending horror show. No
one liked using the company’s software that tracked the bill of materials. So
some people used it, and some people didn’t. Those that did use it often
made huge errors. They would take the cost of a part from the prototype
cars and then estimate how much of a discount they expected when buying
that part in bulk, rather than actually negotiating to find a viable price. At
one point, the software declared that each Roadster should cost about
$68,000, which would leave Tesla making about $30,000 per vehicle.
Everyone knew the figure was wrong, but it got reported to the board
anyway.
Around the middle of 2007, Watkins came to Musk with his findings.
Musk was prepared for a high figure but felt confident that the price of the
car would come down significantly over time as Tesla ironed out its
manufacturing process and increased its sales. “That’s when Tim told me it
was really bad news,” Musk said. It looked like each Roadster could cost up
to $200,000 to make, and Tesla planned to sell the car for only around
$85,000. “Even in full production, they would have been like $170,000 or
something insane,” Musk said. “Of course, it didn’t much matter because
about a third of the cars didn’t flat-out fucking work.”
Eberhard made attempts to pull his team out of this mess. He’d gone to
see a speech in which the famous venture capitalist John Doerr, who
became a major investor in green technology companies, declared that he
would devote his time and money to trying to save the Earth from global
warming because he owed such an effort to his children. Eberhard promptly
returned to the Tesla building and ginned up a similar speech. In front of
about a hundred people, Eberhard had a picture of his young daughter
projected onto the wall of the main workshop. He asked the Tesla engineers
why he had put that picture up. One of them guessed that it was because
people like his daughter would drive the car. To which Eberhard replied,
“No. We are building this because by the time she is old enough to drive she
will know a car as something completely different to how we know it today,
just like you don’t think of a phone as a thing on the wall with a cord on it.
It’s this future that depends on you.” Eberhard then thanked some of the key
engineers and called out their efforts in public. Many of the engineers had
been pulling all-nighters on a regular basis and Eberhard’s show boosted
morale. “We were all working ourselves to the point of exhaustion,” said
David Vespremi, a former Tesla spokesman. “Then came this profound
moment where we were reminded that building the car was not about
getting to an IPO or selling it to a bunch of rich dudes but because it might
change what a car is.”
These victories, though, were not enough to overcome the feeling
shared by many of the Tesla engineers that Eberhard had reached the end of
his abilities as a CEO. The company veterans had always admired
Eberhard’s engineering smarts and continued to do so. Eberhard, in fact,
had turned Tesla into a cult of engineering. Regrettably, other parts of the
company had been neglected, and people doubted Eberhard’s ability to take
the company from the R&D stage to production. The ridiculous cost of the
car, the transmission, the ineffective suppliers were crippling Tesla. And, as
the company started to miss its delivery dates, many of the once-fanatical
consumers who had made their large up-front payments turned on Tesla and
Eberhard. “We saw the writing on the wall,” Lyons said. “Everyone knew
that the person who starts a company is not necessarily the right person to
lead it in the long term, but whenever that is the case, it’s not easy.”
Eberhard and Musk had battled for years over some of the design points
on the car. But for the most part, they had gotten along well enough. Neither
man suffered fools. And they certainly shared many of the same visions for
the battery technology and what it could mean to the world. What their
relationship could not survive were the cost figures for the Roadster
unearthed by Watkins. It looked to Musk as if Eberhard had grossly
mismanaged the company by allowing the parts costs to soar so high. Then,
as Musk saw it, Eberhard failed to disclose the severity of the situation to
the board. While on his way to give a talk to the Motor Press Guild in Los
Angeles, Eberhard received a call from Musk and in a brief, uncomfortable
chat learned that he would be replaced as CEO.
In August 2007, Tesla’s board demoted Eberhard and named him
president of technology, which only exacerbated the company’s issues.
“Martin was so bitter and disruptive,” Straubel said. “I remember him
running around the office and sowing discontent, as we’re trying to finish
the car and are running out of money and everything is at knife’s edge.” As
Eberhard saw it, other people at Tesla had foisted a wonky finance software
application on him that made it tricky to accurately track costs. He
contended that the delays and cost increases were partly due to the requests
of other members of the management team and that he’d been up front with
the board about the issues. Beyond that, he thought Watkins had made the
situation out to be worse than it really was. Start-ups in Silicon Valley view
mayhem as standard operating procedure. “Valor was used to dealing with
older companies,” Eberhard said. “They found chaos and weren’t used to it.
This was the chaos of a start-up.” Eberhard had also already been asking
Tesla’s board to replace him as CEO and find someone with more
manufacturing experience.
A few months passed, and Eberhard remained pissed-off. Many of the
Tesla employees felt like they were caught in the middle of a divorce and
had to pick their parent—Eberhard or Musk. By the time December arrived,
the situation was untenable, and Eberhard left the company altogether. Tesla
said in a statement that Eberhard had been offered a position on its advisory
board, although he denied that. “I am no longer with Tesla Motors—neither
on its board of directors nor an employee of any sort,” Eberhard said in a
statement at the time. “I’m not happy with the way I was treated.” Musk
sent a note to a Silicon Valley newspaper saying, “I’m sorry that it came to
this and wish it were not so. It was not a question of personality differences,
as the decision to have Martin transition to an advisory role was unanimous
among the board. Tesla has operational problems that need to be solved and
if the board thought there was any way that Martin could be part of the
solution, then he would still be an employee of the company.”9 These
statements were the start of a war that would drag on between the two men
in public for years and that in many ways continues to the present day.
As 2007 played out, the problems mounted for Tesla. The carbon-fiber
body that looked so good turned out to be a huge pain to paint, and Tesla
had to cycle through a couple of companies to find one that could do the
work well. Sometimes there were faults in the battery pack. The motor
short-circuited now and again. The body panels had visible gaps. The
company also had to face up to the reality that a two-speed transmission
was not going to happen. In order for the Roadster to achieve its flashy
zero-to-60 times with a single-speed transmission, Tesla’s engineers had to
redesign the car’s motor and inverter and shave off some weight. “We
essentially had to do a complete reboot,” Musk said. “That was terrible.”
After Eberhard was removed as CEO, Tesla’s board tapped Michael
Marks as its interim chief. Marks had run Flextronics, an enormous
electronics supplier, and had deep experience with complex manufacturing
operations and logistics issues. Marks began interrogating various groups at
the company to try to figure out their problems and to prioritize the issues
plaguing the Roadster. He also put in some basic rules like making sure that
people all showed up at work at the same time to establish a baseline of
productivity—a tricky ask in Silicon Valley’s work anywhere, anytime
culture. All of these moves were part of the Marks List, a 10-point, 100-day
plan that included eliminating all faults in the battery packs, getting gaps
between body parts to less than 40 mm, and booking a specified number of
reservations. “Martin had been falling apart and lacked a lot of the
discipline key for a manager,” Straubel said. “Michael came in and
evaluated the mess and was a bullshit filter. He didn’t really have a dog in
the fight and could say, ‘I don’t care what you think or what you think. This
is what we should do.’” For a while, Marks’s strategy worked, and the
engineers at Tesla could once again focus on building the Roadster rather
than on internal politics. But then Marks’s vision for the company began to
diverge from Musk’s.
By this time, Tesla had moved into a larger facility at 1050 Bing Street
in San Carlos. The bigger building allowed Tesla to bring the battery work
back in-house from Asia and for it to do some of the Roadster
manufacturing, alleviating the supply chain issues. Tesla was maturing as a
car company, although its wild-child start-up streak remained well intact.
While strolling around the factory one day, Marks saw a Smart car from
Daimler on a lift. Musk and Straubel had a small side project going on
around the Smart car to see what it might be like as an electric vehicle.
“Michael didn’t know about it, and he’s like, ‘Who is the CEO here?’” said
Lyons. (The work on the Smart car eventually led to Daimler buying a 10
percent stake in Tesla.)
Marks’s inclination was to try to package Tesla as an asset that could be
sold to a larger car company. It was a perfectly reasonable plan. While
running Flextronics, Marks had overseen a vast, global supply chain and
knew the difficulties of manufacturing intimately. Tesla must have looked
borderline hopeless to him at this point. The company could not make its
one product well, was poised to hemorrhage money, and had missed a string
of delivery deadlines and yet its engineers were still off doing side
experiments. Making Tesla look as pretty as possible for a suitor was the
rational thing to do.
In just about every other case, Marks would be thanked for his decisive
plan of action and saving the company’s investors from a big loss. But
Musk had little interest in polishing up Tesla’s assets for the highest bidder.
He’d started the company to put a dent in the automotive industry and force
people to rethink electric cars. Instead of doing the fashionable Silicon
Valley thing of “pivoting” toward a new idea or plan, Musk would dig in
deeper. “The product was late and over budget and everything was wrong,
but Elon didn’t want anything to do with those plans to either sell the whole
company or lose control through a partnership,” Straubel said. “So, Elon
decided to double down.”
On December 3, 2007, Ze’ev Drori replaced Marks as CEO. Drori had
experience in Silicon Valley starting a company that made computer
memory and selling it to the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. Drori
was not Musk’s first pick—a top choice had turned down the job because he
didn’t want to move from the East Coast—and did not inspire much
enthusiasm from the Tesla employees. Drori had about fifteen years on the
youngest Tesla worker and no connection to this group bonded by suffering
and toil. He came to be seen more as an executor of Musk’s wishes than as
a commanding, independent CEO.
Musk began making more public gestures to mitigate the bad press
around Tesla. He issued statements and did interviews, promising that the
Roadster would ship to customers in early 2008. He began talking up a car
code-named WhiteStar—the Roadster had been code-named DarkStar—that
would be a sedan possibly priced around $50,000, and a new factory to
build the machine. “Given the recent management changes, some
reassurances are in order regarding Tesla Motors’ future plans,” Musk wrote
in a blog post. “The near term message is simple and unequivocal—we are
going to deliver a great sports car next year that customers will love driving.
. . . My car, production VIN 1, is already off the production line in the UK
and final preparations are being made for importation.” Tesla held a series
of town hall meetings with customers where it tried to fess up to its
problems in the open, and it started building some showrooms for its car.
Vince Sollitto, the former PayPal executive, visited the Menlo Park
showroom and found Musk complaining about the public relations issues
but clearly inspired by the product Tesla was building. “His demeanor
changed the moment we got to this display of the motor,” Sollitto said.
Dressed in a leather jacket and slacks, Musk started talking about the
motor’s properties and then put on a performance worthy of a carnival
strongman by lifting the hundred-or-so-pound hunk of metal. “He picks this
thing up and wedges it between his two palms,” Sollitto said. “He’s holding
it, and he’s shaking and beads of sweat are forming on his forehead. It
wasn’t so much a display of strength as a physical demonstration of the
beauty of the product.” While the customers complained a lot about the
delays, they seemed to sense this passion from Musk and share his
enthusiasm for the product. Only a handful of customers asked for their
prepayments back.
Tesla employees soon got to witness the same Musk that SpaceX
employees had seen for years. When an issue like the Roadster’s faulty
carbon-fiber body panels cropped up, Musk dealt with it directly. He flew to
England in his jet to pick up some new manufacturing tools for the body
panels and personally delivered them to a factory in France to ensure that
the Roadster stayed on its production schedule. The days of people being
ambiguous about the Roadster’s manufacturing costs were gone as well.
“Elon got fired up and said we were going to do this intense cost-down
program,” said Popple. “He gave a speech, saying we would work on
Saturdays and Sundays and sleep under desks until it got done. Someone
pushed back from the table and argued that everyone had been working so
hard just to get the car done, and they were ready for a break and to see
their families. Elon said, ‘I would tell those people they will get to see their
families a lot when we go bankrupt.’ I was like, ‘Wow,’ but I got it. I had
come out of a military culture, and you just have to make your objective
happen.” Employees were required to meet at 7 A.M. every Thursday
morning for bill-of-materials updates. They had to know the price of every
part and have a cogent plan for getting parts cheaper. If the motor cost
$6,500 a pop at the end of December, Musk wanted it to cost $3,800 by
April. The costs were plotted and analyzed each month. “If you started
falling behind, there was hell to pay,” Popple said. “Everyone could see it,
and people lost their jobs when they didn’t deliver. Elon has a mind that’s a
bit like a calculator. If you put a number on the projector that does not make
sense, he will spot it. He doesn’t miss details.” Popple found Musk’s style
aggressive, but he liked that Musk would listen to a well-argued, analytical
point and often change his mind if given a good enough reason. “Some
people thought Elon was too tough or hot-tempered or tyrannical,” Popple
said. “But these were hard times, and those of us close to the operational
realities of the company knew it. I appreciated that he didn’t sugarcoat
things.”
On the marketing front, Musk would run daily Google searches for
news stories about Tesla. If he saw a bad story, he ordered someone to “fix
it” even though the Tesla public relations people could do little to sway the
reporters. One employee missed an event to witness the birth of his child.
Musk fired off an e-mail saying, “That is no excuse. I am extremely
disappointed. You need to figure out where your priorities are. We’re
changing the world and changing history, and you either commit or you
don’t.”*
Marketing people who made grammatical mistakes in e-mails were let
go, as were other people who hadn’t done anything “awesome” in recent
memory. “He can be incredibly intimidating at times but doesn’t have a real
sense for just how imposing he can be,” said one former Tesla executive.
“We’d have these meetings and take bets on who was going to get bloodied
and bruised. If you told him that you made a particular choice because ‘it
was the standard way things had always been done,’ he’d kick you out of a
meeting fast. He’d say, ‘I never want to hear that phrase again. What we
have to do is fucking hard and half-assing things won’t be tolerated.’ He
just destroys you and, if you survive, he determines if he can trust you. He
has to understand that you’re as crazy as he is.” This ethos filtered through
the entire company, and everyone quickly understood that Musk meant
business.
Straubel, while sometimes on the bad end of the critiques, welcomed
Musk’s hard-charging presence. The five years to get to this point had been
an enjoyable slog for him. Straubel had transformed from a quiet, capable
engineer who shuffled around Tesla’s factory floor with his head down into
the most crucial member of the technical team. He knew more about the
batteries and the electric drivetrain than just about anyone else at the
company. He also began developing a role as a go-between for employees
and Musk. Straubel’s engineering smarts and work ethic had earned Musk’s
respect, and Straubel found that he could deliver difficult messages to Musk
on behalf of other employees. As he would do for years to come, Straubel
also proved willing to check his ego at the door. All that mattered was
getting the Roadster and the follow-on sedan to market to popularize
electric cars, and Musk looked like the best person to make that happen.
Other employees had enjoyed the thrill of the engineering challenge
over the past five years but were burnt-out beyond repair. Wright didn’t
believe that an electric car for the masses would ever take off. He left and
started his own company dedicated to making electric versions of delivery
trucks. Berdichevsky had been a crucial, do-anything young engineer for
much of Tesla’s existence. Now that the company employed about three
hundred people, he felt less effective and didn’t relish the idea of suffering
for another five years to bring the sedan to market. He would leave Tesla,
get a couple of degrees from Stanford, and cofound a start-up looking to
make a revolutionary new battery that could soon go into electric cars. With
Eberhard gone, Tarpenning found Tesla less fun. He didn’t see eye to eye
with Drori and also shied away from the idea of frying his soul to get the
sedan out. Lyons stuck around longer, which is a minor miracle. At various
points, he had led the development of most of the core technology behind
the Roadster, including the battery packs, the motor, the power electronics,
and, yes, the transmission. This meant that for about five years Lyons had
been among Tesla’s most capable employees and the guy constantly in the
doghouse for being behind on something and thus holding the rest of the
company up. He suffered through some of Musk’s more colorful tirades—
directed either at him or suppliers that had let Tesla down—that included
talk of people’s balls being chopped off and other violent or sexual acts.
Lyons also saw an exhausted, stressed-out Musk spit coffee across a
conference room table because it was cold and then, without a pause,
demand that the employees work harder, do more, and mess up less. Like so
many people privy to these performances, Lyons came away with no
illusions about Musk’s personality but with the utmost respect for his vision
and drive to execute. “Working at Tesla back then was like being Kurtz in
Apocalypse Now,” Lyons said. “Don’t worry about the methods or if they’re
unsound. Just get the job done. It comes from Elon. He listens, asks good
questions, is fast on his feet, and gets to the bottom of things.”
Tesla could survive the loss of some of these early hires. Its strong
brand had allowed the company to keep recruiting top talent, including
people from large automotive companies who knew how to get over the last
set of challenges blocking the Roadster from reaching customers. But
Tesla’s major issue no longer revolved around effort, engineering, or clever
marketing. Heading into 2008, the company was running out of money. The
Roadster had cost about $140 million to develop, way over the $25 million
originally estimated in the 2004 business plan. Under normal
circumstances, Tesla had probably done enough to raise more funds. These,
however, were not normal times. The big automakers in the United States
were charging toward bankruptcy in the middle of the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression. In the midst of all this, Musk needed to
convince Tesla’s investors to fork over tens of millions of additional dollars,
and those investors had to go to their constituents to lay out why this made
any sense. As Musk put it, “Try to imagine explaining that you’re investing
in an electric car company, and everything you read about the car company
sounds like it is shit and doomed and it’s a recession and no one is buying
cars.” All Musk had to do to dig Tesla out of this conundrum was lose his
entire fortune and verge on a nervous breakdown.

PAIN, SUFFERING, AND SURVIVAL
AS HE PREPARED TO BEGIN FILMING IRON MAN IN EARLY 2007,
the director Jon Favreau rented out a complex in Los Angeles that once
belonged to Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace and defense contractor started
about eighty years earlier by Howard Hughes. The facility had a series of
interlocking hangars and served as a production office for the movie. It also
supplied Robert Downey Jr., who was to play Iron Man and his human
creator Tony Stark, with a splash of inspiration. Downey felt nostalgic
looking at one of the larger hangars, which had fallen into a state of
disrepair. Not too long ago, that building had played host to the big ideas of
a big man who shook up industries and did things his own way.
Downey heard some rumblings about a Hughes-like figure named Elon
Musk who had constructed his own, modern-day industrial complex about
ten miles away. Instead of visualizing how life might have been for Hughes,
Downey could perhaps get a taste of the real thing. He set off in March
2007 for SpaceX’s headquarters in El Segundo and wound up receiving a
personal tour from Musk. “My mind is not easily blown, but this place and
this guy were amazing,” Downey said.
To Downey, the SpaceX facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware
store. Enthusiastic employees were zipping about, fiddling with an
assortment of machines. Young white-collar engineers interacted with bluecollar
assembly line workers, and they all seemed to share a genuine
excitement for what they were doing. “It felt like a radical start-up
company,” Downey said. After the initial tour, Downey came away pleased
that the sets being hammered out at the Hughes factory did have parallels to
the SpaceX factory. “Things didn’t feel out of place,” he said.
Beyond the surroundings, Downey really wanted a peek inside Musk’s
psyche. The men walked, sat in Musk’s office, and had lunch. Downey
appreciated that Musk was not a foul-smelling, fidgety, coder whack job.
What Downey picked up on instead were Musk’s “accessible eccentricities”
and the feeling that he was an unpretentious sort who could work alongside
the people in the factory. Both Musk and Stark were the type of men,
according to Downey, who “had seized an idea to live by and something to
dedicate themselves to” and were not going to waste a moment.
When he returned to the Iron Man production office, Downey asked that
Favreau be sure to place a Tesla Roadster in Tony Stark’s workshop. On a
superficial level, this would symbolize that Stark was so cool and connected
that he could get a Roadster before it even went on sale. On a deeper level,
the car was to be placed as the nearest object to Stark’s desk so that it
formed something of a bond between the actor, the character, and Musk.
“After meeting Elon and making him real to me, I felt like having his
presence in the workshop,” Downey said. “They became contemporaries.
Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more
likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions
with the shamans.”
After Iron Man came out, Favreau began talking up Musk’s role as the
inspiration for Downey’s interpretation of Tony Stark. It was a stretch on
many levels. Musk is not exactly the type of guy who downs scotch in the
back of a Humvee while part of a military convoy in Afghanistan. But the
press lapped up the comparison, and Musk started to become more of a
public figure. People who sort of knew him as “that PayPal guy” began to
think of him as the rich, eccentric businessman behind SpaceX and Tesla.
Musk enjoyed his rising profile. It fed his ego and provided some fun.
He and Justine bought a house in Bel Air. Their neighbor to one side was
Quincy Jones, the music producer, and their other neighbor was Joe Francis,
the infamous creator of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Musk and some former
PayPal executives, having settled their differences, produced Thank You for
Smoking and used Musk’s jet in the movie. While not a hard-drinking
carouser, Musk took part in the Hollywood nightlife and its social scene.
“There were just a lot of parties to go to,” said Bill Lee, Musk’s close
friend. “Elon was neighbors with two quasi-celebrities. Our friends were
making movies and through this confluence of our networks, there was
something to go out and do every night.” In one interview, Musk calculated
that his life had become 10 percent playboy and 90 percent engineer.10 “We
had a domestic staff of five; during the day our home transformed into a
workplace,” Justine wrote in magazine article. “We went to black-tie
fundraisers and got the best tables at elite Hollywood nightclubs, with Paris
Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio partying next to us. When Google cofounder
Larry Page got married on Richard Branson’s private Caribbean island, we
were there, hanging out in a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono
pose with swarms of adoring women outside the reception tent.”
Justine appeared to relish their status even more than Musk. A writer of
fantasy fiction novels, she kept a blog detailing the couple’s family life and
their adventures on the town. In one entry, Justine had Musk saying that
he’d prefer to sleep with Veronica than Betty from the Archie comics and
that he’d like to visit a Chuck E. Cheese sometime. In another entry, she
wrote about meeting Leonardo DiCaprio at a club and having him beg for a
free Tesla Roadster, only to be turned down. Justine handed out nicknames
to oft-occurring characters in the blog, so Bill Lee became “Bill the Hotel
Guy” because he owns a hotel in the Dominican Republic, and Joe Francis
appeared as “Notorious Neighbor.” It’s hard to imagine Musk, who keeps to
himself, hanging out with someone as ostentatious as Francis, but the men
got along well. When Francis took over an amusement park for his birthday,
Musk attended and then ended up partying at Francis’s house. Justine wrote,
“E was there for a bit but admitted he also found it ‘kind of lame’—he’s
been to a couple of parties at NN’s house now and ends up feeling selfconscious,
‘because it just seems like there are always these skeevy guys
wandering around the house trolling for girls. I don’t want to be seen as one
of those guys.’” When Francis got ready to buy a Roadster, he stopped by
the Musks’ house and handed over a yellow envelope with $100,000 in
cash. For a while, the blog provided a rare, welcome glimpse into the life of
an unconventional CEO. Musk seemed charming. The public learned that
he bought Justine a nineteenth-century edition of Pride and Prejudice, that
Musk’s best friends gave him the nickname “Elonius,” and that Musk likes
to place one-dollar wagers on all manner of things—Can you catch herpes
from the Great Barrier Reef? Is it possible to balance two forks with a
toothpick?—that he knows he will win. Justine told one story about Musk
traveling to Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, to hang out with
Tony Blair and Richard Branson. A photo of the three men appeared later in
the press that depicted Musk with a vacant stare. “This was E’s I’mthinking-
about-a-rocket-problem stance, which makes me pretty sure that
he had just gotten some kind of bothersome work-related e-mail, and was
clearly oblivious to the fact that a picture was being taken at all,” she wrote.
“This is also the reason I get suck [sic] a kick out of it—the spouse the
camera caught is the exact spouse I encountered, say, last night en route to
the bathroom, standing in the hallway frowning with his arms folded.”
Justine letting the world into the couple’s bathroom should have served as a
warning of things to come. Her blog would soon turn into one of Musk’s
worst nightmares.
The press had not run into a guy like Musk for a very long time. His
shine as an Internet millionaire kept getting, well, shinier thanks to PayPal’s
ongoing success. He also had an element of mystery. There was the weird
name. And there was the willingness to spend vast sums of money on
spaceships and electric cars, which came across as a combination of daring,
flamboyant, and downright flabbergasting. “Elon Musk has been called
‘part playboy, part space cowboy,’ an image hardly dispelled by a car
collection that has boasted a Porsche 911 Turbo, 1967 Series 1 Jaguar, a
Hamann BMW M5 plus the aforementioned McLaren F1—which he has
driven at up to 215mph on a private airstrip,” a British reporter gushed in
2007. “Then there was the L39 Soviet military jet, which he sold after
becoming a father.” The press had picked up on the fact that Musk tended to
talk a huge game and then struggle to deliver on his promises in time, but
they didn’t much care. The game he talked was so much bigger than anyone
else’s that reporters were comfortable giving Musk leeway. Tesla became
the darling of Silicon Valley’s bloggers, who tracked its every move and
were breathless in their coverage. Similarly, reporters covering SpaceX
were overjoyed that a young, feisty company had arrived to needle Boeing,
Lockheed, and, to a large extent, NASA. All Musk had to do was eventually
bring some of these wondrous things he’d been funding to market.
While Musk put on a good show for the public and press, he’d started to
get very worried about his businesses. SpaceX’s second launch attempt had
failed, and the reports coming in from Tesla kept getting worse. Musk had
started these two adventures with a fortune nearing $200 million and had
chewed through more than half the money with little to show for it. As each
Tesla delay turned into a PR fiasco, the Musk glow dimmed. People in
Silicon Valley began to gossip about Musk’s money problems. Reporters
who months earlier had been heaping adulation on Musk turned on him.
The New York Times picked up on Tesla’s transmission problems.
Automotive websites griped that the Roadster might never ship. By the end
of 2007, things got downright nasty. Valleywag, Silicon Valley’s gossip
blog, began to take a particular interest in Musk. Owen Thomas, the site’s
lead writer, dug into the histories of Zip2 and PayPal and played up the
times Musk was ousted as CEO to undermine some of his entrepreneurial
street cred. Thomas then championed the premise that Musk was a master
manipulator who played fast and loose with other people’s money. “It’s
wonderful that Musk has realized even a small part of his childhood
fantasies,” Thomas wrote. “But he risks destroying his dreams by refusing
to reconcile them with reality.” Valleywag anointed the Tesla Roadster as its
No. 1 fail of 2007 among technology companies.
As his businesses and public persona suffered, Musk’s home life
degraded as well. His triplets—Kai, Damian, and Saxon—had arrived near
the end of 2006 and joined their brothers Griffin and Xavier. According to
Musk, Justine suffered from postpartum depression following the birth of
the triplets. “In the spring of 2007, our marriage was having real issues,”
Musk said. “It was on the rocks.” Justine’s blog posts back up his
sentiments. She described a much less romantic Musk and felt people
treated her as “an arm ornament who couldn’t possibly have anything
interesting to say” rather than as an author and her husband’s equal. During
one trip to St. Barts, the Musks ended up sharing dinner with some wealthy,
influential couples. When Justine let out her political views, one of the men
at the table made a crack about her being so opinionated. “E chuckled back,
patted my hand the way you pat a child’s,” Justine wrote on her blog. From
that point on, Justine ordered Musk to introduce her as a published novelist
and not just his wife and mother of his children. The results? “E’s way of
doing this throughout the rest of the trip: ‘Justine wants me to tell you that
she’s written novels,’ which made people look at me like oh, that’s just so
cute and didn’t really help my case.”
As 2007 rolled into 2008, Musk’s life became more tumultuous. Tesla
basically had to start over on much of the Roadster, and SpaceX still had
dozens of people living in Kwajalein awaiting the next launch of the Falcon
1. Both endeavors were vacuuming up Musk’s money. He started selling off
prized possessions like the McLaren to generate extra cash. Musk tended to
shield employees from the gravity of his fiscal situation by always
encouraging them to do their best work. At the same time, he personally
oversaw all significant purchases at both companies. Musk also trained
employees to make the right trade-offs between spending money and
productivity. This struck many of the SpaceX employees as a novel idea,
since they were used to traditional aerospace companies that had huge,
multiyear government contracts and no day-to-day survival pressure. “Elon
would always be at work on Sunday, and we had some chats where he laid
out his philosophy,” said Kevin Brogan, the early SpaceX employee. “He
would say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that
we were burning through a hundred thousand dollars per day. It was this
very entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley way of thinking that none of the
aerospace engineers in Los Angeles were dialed into. Sometimes he
wouldn’t let you buy a part for two thousand dollars because he expected
you to find it cheaper or invent something cheaper. Other times, he
wouldn’t flinch at renting a plane for ninety thousand dollars to get
something to Kwaj because it saved an entire workday, so it was worth it.
He would place this urgency that he expected the revenue in ten years to be
ten million dollars a day and that every day we were slower to achieve our
goals was a day of missing out on that money.”
Musk had become all consumed with Tesla and SpaceX out of necessity,
and there can be no doubt that this exacerbated the tensions in his marriage.
The Musks had a team of nannies to help with their five children, but Elon
could not spend much time at home. He worked seven days a week and
quite often split his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Justine
needed a change. During moments of self-reflection, she felt sickened,
perceiving herself a trophy wife. Justine longed to be Elon’s partner again
and to feel some of that spark from their early days before life had turned so
dazzling and demanding. It’s not clear how much Musk let on to Justine
about his dwindling bank account. She has long maintained that Musk kept
her in the dark about the family’s financial arrangements. But some of
Musk’s closest friends did get a glimpse into the worsening financial
situation. In the first half of 2008, Antonio Gracias, the founder and CEO of
Valor Equity, met Musk for dinner. Gracias had been an investor in Tesla
and had become one of Musk’s closest friends and allies, and he could see
Musk agonizing over his future. “Things were starting to be difficult with
Justine, but they were still together,” Gracias said. “During that dinner, Elon
said, ‘I will spend my last dollar on these companies. If we have to move
into Justine’s parents’ basement, we’ll do it.’”
The option of moving in with Justine’s parents expired on June 16,
2008, when Musk filed for divorce. The couple did not disclose the
situation right away, although Justine left hints on her blog. In late June, she
posted a quotation from Moby without any additional context: “There’s no
such thing as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well adjusted they
wouldn’t try to be a public figure.” The next entry had Justine house
hunting for undisclosed reasons with Sharon Stone, and a couple of entries
later she talked about “a major drama” that she’d been dealing with. In
September, Justine wrote her first blog post explicitly about the divorce,
saying, “We had a good run. We married young, took it as far as we could
and now it is over.” Valleywag naturally followed with a story about the
divorce and noted that Musk had been seen out with a twenty-something
actress.
The media coverage and divorce freed Justine to write about her private
life in a much more liberated way. In the posts that followed, she gave her
account of how the marriage ended, her views on Musk’s girlfriend and
future second wife, and the inner workings of the divorce proceedings. For
the first time, the public had access to a deeply unpleasant portrayal of
Musk and received some firsthand accounts—albeit from an ex-wife—of
his hardline behavior. The writing may have been biased, but it provided a
window into how Musk operated. Here’s one post about the lead-up to the
divorce and its rapid execution:
Divorce, for me, was like the bomb you set off when all other
options have been exhausted. I had not yet given up on the
diplomacy option, which was why I hadn’t already filed. We were
still in the early stages of marital counseling (three sessions total).
Elon, however, took matters into his own hands—he tends to like to
do that—when he gave me an ultimatum: “Either we fix [the
marriage] today, or I will divorce you tomorrow.”
That night, and again the next morning, he asked me what I
wanted to do. I stated emphatically that I was not ready to unleash
the dogs of divorce; I suggested that “we” hold off for at least
another week. Elon nodded, touched the top of my head, and left.
Later that same morning I tried to make a purchase and discovered
that he had cut off my credit card, which is when I also knew that he
had gone ahead and filed (as it was, E did not tell me directly; he
had another person do it).
For Musk, each online missive from Justine created another public
relations crisis that added to the endless stream of issues faced by his
companies. The image he’d sculpted over the years appeared ready to
crumble alongside his businesses. It was a disaster scenario.
Soon enough, the Musks had achieved celebrity divorce status.
Mainstream outlets joined Valleywag in poring over court filings tied to the
breakup, particularly as Justine fought for more money. During the PayPal
days, Justine had signed a postnuptial agreement and now argued that she
didn’t really have the time or inclination to dig into the ramifications of the
paperwork. Justine took to her blog in an entry titled “golddigger,” and said
she was fighting for a divorce settlement that would include their house,
alimony and child support, $6 million in cash, 10 percent of Musk’s Tesla
stock, 5 percent of Musk’s SpaceX stock, and a Tesla Roadster. Justine also
appeared on CNBC’s show Divorce Wars and wrote an article for Marie
Claire titled “‘I Was a Starter Wife’: Inside America’s Messiest Divorce.”
The public tended to side with Justine during all of this and couldn’t
quite figure out why a billionaire was fighting his wife’s seemingly fair
requests. A major problem for Musk, of course, was that his assets were
anything but liquid with most of his net worth being tied up in Tesla and
SpaceX stock. The couple eventually settled with Justine getting the house,
$2 million in cash (minus her legal fees), $80,000 a month in alimony and
child support for seventeen years, and a Tesla Roadster.*
Years after the settlement, Justine still struggled to speak about her
relationship with Musk. During our interview, she broke down in tears
several times and needed moments to compose her thoughts. Musk, she
said, had hidden many things from her during their marriage and ultimately
treated her much like a business adversary to be conquered during the
divorce. “We were at war for a while, and when you go to war with Elon,
it’s pretty brutal,” she said. Well after their marriage ended, Justine
continued to blog about Musk. She wrote about Riley and provided
commentary on his parenting. One post gave Musk a hard time for banning
stuffed animals from the house when their twins turned seven. Asked about
this, Justine said, “Elon is hard-core. He grew up in a tough culture and
tough circumstances. He had to become very tough to not only thrive but to
conquer the world. He doesn’t want to raise soft overprivileged kids with no
direction.” Comments like these seemed to indicate that Justine still
admired or at least understood Musk’s strong will.*
In the weeks after he first filed for divorce in mid-June of 2008, Musk
tumbled into a deep funk. Bill Lee started to worry about his friend’s mental
state and, as one of Musk’s more free-spirited friends, wanted to do
something to cheer him up. Now and again, Musk and Lee, an investor,
would take trips overseas and mix business and pleasure. The time was
right for just such a journey, and they set off for London at the start of July.
The decompression program began poorly. Musk and Lee visited the
headquarters of Aston Martin to see the company’s CEO and get a tour of
his factory. The executive treated Musk like an amateur car builder, talking
down to him and suggesting that he knew more about electric vehicles than
anyone else on the planet. “He was a complete douche,” as Lee put it, and
the men did their best to make a hasty exit back to central London. Along
the way, Musk had a nagging stomach pain turn severe. At the time, Lee
was married to Sarah Gore, the daughter of former vice president Al Gore,
who had been a medical student, and so he called her for advice. They
decided that Musk might be suffering from appendicitis, and Lee took him
to a medical clinic in the middle of a shopping mall. When the tests came
back negative, Lee set to work trying to goad Musk into a night on the
town. “Elon didn’t want to go out, and I didn’t really, either,” Lee said. “But
I was like, ‘No, come on. We’re all the way here.’”
Lee coaxed Musk into going to a club called Whisky Mist, in Mayfair.
People had packed the small, high-end dance spot and Musk wanted to
leave after ten minutes. The well-connected Lee texted a promoter friend of
his, who pulled some strings to get Musk escorted into the VIP area. The
promoter then reached out to some of his prettiest friends, including a
twenty-two-year-old up-and-coming actress named Talulah Riley, and they
soon arrived at the club as well. Riley and her two gorgeous friends had
come from a charity gala and were in full-length, flowing gowns. “Talulah
was in this huge Cinderella thing,” Lee said. Musk and Riley were
introduced by people at the club, and he perked at the sight of her dazzling
figure.
Musk and Riley sat at a table with their friends but immediately zeroed
in on each other. Riley had just hit it big with her portrayal of Mary Bennet
in Pride and Prejudice and thought of herself as quite the hotshot. The older
Musk, meanwhile, took on the role of the soft-spoken, sweet engineer. He
whipped out his phone and displayed photos of the Falcon 1 and Roadster,
although Riley thought he had just done some work on these projects and
didn’t realize he ran the companies building the machines. “I remember
thinking that this guy probably didn’t get to talk to young actresses a lot and
that he seemed quite nervous,” Riley said. “I decided to be really nice to
him and give him a nice evening. Little did I know that he’d spoken to a lot
of pretty girls in his life.”* The more Musk and Riley talked, the more Lee
egged them on. It was the first time in weeks that his friend appeared happy.
“His stomach didn’t hurt; he’s not bummed, this is great,” Lee said. Despite
being dressed for a fairy tale, Riley didn’t fall in love with Musk at first
sight. But she did become more impressed and intrigued as the night went
on, particularly after the club promoter introduced Musk to a stunning
model, and he politely said “Hello” and then sat right back down with
Riley. “I figured he couldn’t be all bad after that,” said Riley, who then
allowed Musk to place his hand on her knee. Musk asked Riley out to
dinner the next night, and she accepted.
With her curvy figure, sultry eyes, and playful good-girl demeanor,
Riley was a budding film star but didn’t really act the part. She grew up in
the idyllic English countryside, went to a top school, and, until a week
before she met Musk, had been living at home with her parents. After the
night at Whisky Mist, Riley called her family to tell them about the
interesting guy she had met who builds rockets and cars. Her father used to
head up the National Crime Squad and went straight to his computer to
conduct a background check that illuminated Musk’s resume as a married
international playboy with five kids. Riley’s father chided his daughter for
being a fool, but she held out hope that Musk had an explanation and went
to dinner with him anyway.
Musk brought Lee to the dinner, and Riley brought her friend Tamsin
Egerton, also a beautiful actress. Things were cooler throughout the meal as
the group dined in a depressingly empty restaurant. Riley waited to see
what Musk would bring up on his own. Eventually, he did announce his five
sons and his pending divorce. The confession proved enough to keep Riley
interested and curious about where things would lead. Following the meal,
Musk and Riley broke off on their own. They went for a walk through Soho
and then stopped at Cafe Boheme, where Riley, a lifelong teetotaler, sipped
an apple juice. Musk kept Riley’s attention, and the romance began in
earnest.
The couple had lunch the next day and then went to the White Cube, a
modern art gallery, and then back to Musk’s hotel room. Musk told Riley, a
virgin, that he wanted to show her his rockets. “I was skeptical, but he did
actually show me rocket videos,” she said. Once Musk went back to the
United States,* they kept in touch via e-mail for a couple of weeks, and
then Riley booked a flight to Los Angeles. “I wasn’t even thinking
girlfriend or anything like that,” Riley said. “I was just having fun.”
Musk had other ideas. Riley had been in California for just five days
when he made his move as they lay in bed talking in a tiny room at the
Peninsula hotel in Beverley Hills. “He said, ‘I don’t want you to leave. I
want you to marry me.’ I think I laughed. Then, he said, ‘No. I’m serious.
I’m sorry I don’t have a ring.’ I said, ‘We can shake on it if you like.’ And
we did. I don’t remember what I was thinking at the time, and all I can say
is that I was twenty-two.”
Riley had been a model daughter up to that point, never giving her
parents much of anything to worry about. She did well at school, had scored
some tremendous acting gigs, and had a soft, sweet personality that her
friends described as Snow White brought to life. But there she was on the
hotel’s balcony, informing her parents that she had agreed to marry a man
fourteen years her senior, who had just filed for divorce from his first wife,
had five kids and two companies, and she didn’t even see how she could
possibly love him after knowing him for a matter of weeks. “I think my
mother had a nervous breakdown,” Riley said. “But I had always been
highly romantic, and it actually didn’t strike me as that strange.” Riley flew
back to England to gather her things, and her parents flew back with her to
the United States to meet Musk, who belatedly asked Riley’s father for his
blessing. Musk did not have his own house, which left the couple moving
into a home that belonged to Musk’s friend the billionaire Jeff Skoll. “I had
been living there a week when this random guy walked in,” Riley said. “I
said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I am the homeowner. Who are you?’ I told
him, and then he just walked out.” Musk later proposed to Riley again on
the balcony of Skoll’s house, unveiling a massive ring. (He has since bought
her three engagement rings, including the giant first one, an everyday ring,
and one designed by Musk that has a diamond surrounded by ten
sapphires.) “I remember him saying, ‘Being with me was choosing the hard
path.’ I didn’t quite understand at the time, but I do now. It’s quite hard,
quite the crazy ride.”
Riley experienced a baptism by fire. The whirlwind romance had given
her the impression that she was engaged to a world conquering, jet-setting
billionaire. That was true in theory but a murkier proposition in practice. As
late July rolled around, Musk could see that he had just enough cash on
hand to scrape through to the end of the year. Both SpaceX and Tesla would
need cash infusions at some point just to pay the employees, and it was
unclear where that money would come from with the world’s financial
markets in disarray and investments being put on hold. If things had been
going more smoothly at the companies, Musk could have felt more
confident about raising money, but they were not. “He would come home
every day, and there would be some calamity,” Riley said. “He was under
immense pressure from all quarters. It was horrendous.”
SpaceX’s third flight from Kwajalein jumped out as Musk’s most
pressing concern. His team of engineers had remained camped out on the
island, preparing the Falcon 1 for another run. A typical company would
focus just on the task at hand. Not SpaceX. It had shipped the Falcon 1 to
Kwaj in April with one set of engineers and then put another group of
engineers on a new project to develop the Falcon 9, a nine-engine rocket
that would take the place of the Falcon 5 and serve as a possible
replacement to the retiring space shuttle. SpaceX had yet to prove it could
get to space successfully, but Musk kept positioning it to bid on big-ticket
NASA contracts.*
On July 30, 2008, the Falcon 9 had a successful test fire in Texas with
all nine of its engines lighting up and producing 850,000 pounds of thrust.
Three days later, in Kwaj, SpaceX’s engineers fueled up the Falcon 1 and
crossed their fingers. The rocket had an air force satellite as its payload,
along with a couple of experiments from NASA. All told, the cargo
weighed 375 pounds.
SpaceX had been making significant changes to its rocket since the last,
failed launch. A traditional aerospace company would not have wanted the
added risk, but Musk insisted that SpaceX push its technology forward
while at the same time trying to make it work right. Among the biggest
changes for the Falcon 1 was a new version of the Merlin 1 engine that
relied on a tweaked cooling system.
The first launch attempt on August 2, 2008, aborted at T minus zero
seconds. SpaceX regrouped and tried to launch again the same day. This
time everything seemed to be going well. The Falcon 1 soared into the sky
and flew spectacularly without any indication of a problem. SpaceX
employees watching a webcast of the proceedings back in California let out
hoots and whistles. Then, right at the moment when the first stage and
second stage were to separate, there was a malfunction. An analysis after
the fact would show that the new engines had delivered an unexpected
thrust during the separation process that caused the first stage to bump up
into the second stage, damaging the top part of the rocket and its engine.*
The failed launch left many SpaceX employees shattered. “It was so
profound seeing the energy shift over the room in the course of thirty
seconds,” said Dolly Singh, a recruiter at SpaceX. “It was like the worst
fucking day ever. You don’t usually see grown-ups weeping, but there they
were. We were tired and broken emotionally.” Musk addressed the workers
right away and encouraged them to get back to work. “He said, ‘Look. We
are going to do this. It’s going to be okay. Don’t freak out,’” Singh recalled.
“It was like magic. Everyone chilled out immediately and started to focus
on figuring out what just happened and how to fix it. It went from despair to
hope and focus.” Musk put up a positive front to the public as well. In a
statement, he said that SpaceX had another rocket waiting to attempt a
fourth launch and a fifth launch planned shortly after that. “I have also
given the go-ahead to begin fabrication of flight six,” he said. “Falcon 9
development will also continue unabated.”
In reality, the third launch was a disaster with cascading consequences.
Since the second stage of the rocket did not fire properly, SpaceX never got
a chance to see if it had really fixed the fuel-sloshing issues that had
plagued the second flight. Many of the SpaceX engineers were confident
that they had solved this problem and were anxious to get to the fourth
launch, believing that they had an easy answer for the recent thrust problem.
For Musk, the situation seemed graver. “I was super depressed,” Musk said.
“If we hadn’t solved the slush coupling problem on flight two, or there was
just some random other thing that occurred—say a mistake in the launch
process or the manufacturing process unrelated to anything previous—then
game over.” SpaceX simply did not have enough money to try a fifth flight.
He’d put $100 million into the company and had nothing to spare because
of the issues at Tesla. “Flight four was it,” Musk said. If, however, SpaceX
could nail the fourth flight, it would instill confidence on the part of the
U.S. government and possible commercial customers, paving the way for
the Falcon 9 and even more ambitious projects.
Leading up to the third launch, Musk had been his usual ultra-involved
self. Anyone at SpaceX who held the launch back went onto Musk’s
critical-path shit list. Musk would hound the person responsible about the
delays but, typically, he would also do everything in his power to help solve
problems. “I was personally holding up the launch once and had to give
Elon twice-daily updates about what was going on,” said Kevin Brogan.
“But Elon would say, ‘There are five hundred people at this company. What
do you need?’” One of the calls must have taken place while Musk courted
Riley because Brogan remembered Musk phoning from the bathroom of a
London club to find out how welding had gone on a large part of the rocket.
Musk fielded another call in the middle of the night while sleeping next to
Riley and had to whisper as he berated the engineers. “He’s giving us the
pillow talk voice, so we all have to huddle around the speakerphone, while
he tells us, ‘You guys need to get your shit together,’” Brogan said.
With the fourth launch, the demands and anticipation had ratcheted to
the point that people started making silly mistakes. Typically, the body of
the Falcon 1 rocket traveled to Kwaj via barge. This time Musk and the
engineers were too excited and desperate to wait for the ocean journey.
Musk rented a military cargo plane to fly the rocket body from Los Angeles
to Hawaii and then on to Kwaj. This would have been a fine idea except the
SpaceX engineers forgot to factor in what the pressurized plane would do to
the body of the rocket, which is less than an eighth of an inch thick. As the
plane started its descent into Hawaii, everyone inside of it could hear
strange noises coming from the cargo hold. “I looked back and could see
the stage crumpling,” said Bulent Altan, the former head of avionics at
SpaceX. “I told the pilot to go up, and he did.” The rocket had behaved
much like an empty water bottle will on a plane, with the air pressure
pushing against the sides of the bottle and making it buckle. Altan
calculated that the SpaceX team on the plane had about thirty minutes to do
something about the problem before they would need to land. They pulled
out their pocketknives and cut away the shrink wrap that held the rocket’s
body tight. Then they found a maintenance kit on the plane and used
wrenches to open up some nuts on the rocket that would allow its internal
pressure to match that of the plane’s. When the plane landed, the engineers
divvied up the duties of calling SpaceX’s top executives to tell them about
the catastrophe. It was 3 A.M. Los Angeles time, and one of the executives
volunteered to deliver the horrific news to Musk. The thinking at the time
was that it would take three months to repair the damage. The body of the
rocket had caved in in several places, baffles placed inside the fuel tank to
stop the sloshing problem had broken, and an assortment of other issues had
appeared. Musk ordered the team to continue on to Kwaj and sent in a
reinforcement team with repair parts. Two weeks later, the rocket had been
fixed inside of the makeshift hangar. “It was like being stuck in a foxhole
together,” Altan said. “You weren’t going to quit and leave the person next
to you behind. When it was all done, everyone felt amazing.”
The fourth and possibly final launch for SpaceX took place on
September 28, 2008. The SpaceX employees had worked nonstop shifts
under agonizing pressure for six weeks to reach this day. Their pride as
engineers and their hopes and dreams were on the line. “The people
watching back at the factory were trying their best not to throw up,” said
James McLaury, a machinist at SpaceX. Despite their past flubs, the
engineers on Kwaj were confident that this launch would work. Some of
these people had spent years on the island going through one of the more
surreal engineering exercises in human history. They had been separated
from their families, assaulted by the heat, and exiled on their tiny launchpad
outpost—sometimes without much food—for days on end as they waited
for the launch windows to open and dealt with the aborts that followed. So
much of that pain and suffering and fear would be forgotten if this launch
went successfully.
In the late afternoon on the twenty-eighth, the SpaceX team raised the
Falcon 1 into its launch position. Once again, it stood tall, looking like a
bizarre artifact of an island tribe as palm trees swayed beside it and a
smattering of clouds crossed through the spectacular blue sky. By this time,
SpaceX had upped its webcast game, turning each launch into a major
production both for its employees and the public. Two SpaceX marketing
executives spent twenty minutes before the launch going through all the
technical ins and outs of the launch. The Falcon 1 was not carrying real
cargo this time; neither the company nor the military wanted to see
something else blow up or get lost at sea, so the rocket held a 360-pound
dummy payload.
The fact that SpaceX had been reduced to launch theater did not faze the
employees or dampen their enthusiasm. As the rocket rumbled and then
climbed higher, the employees back at SpaceX headquarters let out raucous
cheers. Each milestone that followed—clearing the island, engine checks
coming back good—was again met with whistles and shouts. As the first
stage fell away, the second stage fired up about ninety seconds into the
flight and the employees turned downright rapturous, filling the webcast
with their ecstatic hollering. “Perfect,” said one of the talking heads. The
Kestrel engine glowed red and started its six-minute burn. “When the
second stage cleared, I could finally start breathing again and my knees
stopped buckling,” said McLaury.
The fairing opened up around the three-minute mark and fell back
toward Earth. And, finally, around nine minutes into its journey, the Falcon
1 shut down just as planned and reached orbit, making it the first privately
built machine to accomplish such a feat. It took six years—about four and
half more than Musk had once planned—and five hundred people to make
this miracle of modern science and business happen.
Earlier in the day, Musk had tried to distract himself from the mounting
pressure by going to Disneyland with his brother Kimbal and their children.
Musk then had to race back to make the 4 P.M. launch and walked into
SpaceX’s trailer control room about two minutes before blastoff. “When the
launch was successful, everyone burst into tears,” Kimbal said. “It was one
of the most emotional experiences I’ve had.” Musk left the control room
and walked out to the factory floor, where he received a rock star’s
welcome. “Well, that was freaking awesome,” he said. “There are a lot of
people who thought we couldn’t do it—a lot actually—but as the saying
goes, ‘the fourth time is the charm,’ right? There are only a handful of
countries on Earth that have done this. It’s normally a country thing, not a
company thing. . . . My mind is kind of frazzled, so it’s hard for me to say
anything, but, man, this is definitely one of the greatest days in my life, and
I think probably for most people here. We showed people we can do it. This
is just the first step of many. . . . I am going to have a really great party
tonight. I don’t know about you guys.” Mary Beth Brown then tapped Musk
on the shoulder and pulled him away to a meeting.
The afterglow of this mammoth victory faded soon after the party
ended, and the severity of SpaceX’s financial hell became top of mind again
for Musk. SpaceX had the Falcon 9 efforts to support and had also
immediately green-lighted the construction of another machine—the
Dragon capsule—that would be used to take supplies, and one day humans,
to the International Space Station. Historically, either project would cost
more than $1 billion to complete, but SpaceX would have to find a way to
build both machines simultaneously for a fraction of the cost. The company
had dramatically increased the rate at which it hired employees and moved
into a much larger headquarters in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX had a
commercial flight booked to carry a satellite into orbit for the Malaysian
government, but that launch and the payment for it would not arrive until
the middle of 2009. In the meantime, SpaceX simply struggled to make its
payroll.
The press did not know the extent of Musk’s financial woes, but they
knew enough to turn detailing Tesla’s precarious financial situation into a
favored pastime. A website called the Truth About Cars began a “Tesla
Death Watch” in May 2008 and followed up with dozens of entries
throughout the year. The blog took special pleasure in rejecting the idea that
Musk was a true founder of the company, presenting him as the moneyman
and chairman who had more or less stolen Tesla from the genius engineer
Eberhard. When Eberhard started a blog detailing the pros and cons of
being a Tesla customer, the auto site was all too happy to echo his gripes.
Top Gear, a popular British television show, ripped the Roadster apart,
making it look as if the car had run out of juice during a road test. “People
joke about the Tesla Death Watch and all that, but it was harsh,” said
Kimbal Musk. “One day there were fifty articles about how Tesla will die.”
Then, in October 2008 (just a couple weeks after SpaceX’s successful
launch), Valleywag appeared on the scene again. First it ridiculed Musk for
officially taking over as CEO of Tesla and replacing Drori, on the grounds
that Musk had just lucked into his past successes. It followed that by
printing a tell-all e-mail from a Tesla employee. The report said that Tesla
had just gone through a round of layoffs, shut down its Detroit office, and
had only $9 million left in the bank. “We have over 1,200 reservations,
which manes [sic] we’ve taken multiples of tens of millions of cash from
our customers and have spent them all,” the Tesla employee wrote.
“Meanwhile, we only delivered less than 50 cars. I actually talked a close
friend of mine into putting down $60,000 for a Tesla Roadster. I cannot
conscientiously be a bystander anymore and allow my company to deceive
the public and defraud our dear customers. Our customers and the general
public are the reason Tesla is so loved. The fact that they are being lied to is
just wrong.”*
Yes, Tesla deserved much of the negative attention. Musk, though, felt
like the 2008 climate with the hatred of bankers and the rich had turned him
into a particularly juicy target. “I was just getting pistol-whipped,” Musk
said. “There was a lot of schadenfreude at the time, and it was bad on so
many levels. Justine was torturing me in the press. There were always all
these negative articles about Tesla, and the stories about SpaceX’s third
failure. It hurt really bad. You have these huge doubts that your life is not
working, your car is not working, you’re going through a divorce and all of
those things. I felt like a pile of shit. I didn’t think we would overcome it. I
thought things were probably fucking doomed.”
When Musk ran through the calculations concerning SpaceX and Tesla,
it occurred to him that only one company would likely even have a chance
at survival. “I could either pick SpaceX or Tesla or split the money I had
left between them,” Musk said. “That was a tough decision. If I split the
money, maybe both of them would die. If I gave the money to just one
company, the probability of it surviving was greater, but then it would mean
certain death for the other company. I debated that over and over.” While
Musk meditated on this, the economy worsened quickly and so too did
Musk’s financial condition. As 2008 came to an end, Musk had run out of
money.
Riley began to see Musk’s life as a Shakespearean tragedy. Sometimes
Musk would open up to her about the issues, and other times he retreated
into himself. Riley spied on Musk while he read e-mail and watched him
grimace as the bad news poured in. “You’d witness him having these
conversations in his head,” she said. “It’s really hard to watch someone you
love struggle like that.” Because of the long hours that he worked and his
eating habits, Musk’s weight fluctuated wildly. Bags formed under his eyes,
and his countenance started to resemble that of a shattered runner at the
back end of an ultra-marathon. “He looked like death itself,” Riley said. “I
remember thinking this guy would have a heart attack and die. He seemed
like a man on the brink.” In the middle of the night, Musk would have
nightmares and yell out. “He was in physical pain,” Riley said. “He would
climb on me and start screaming while still asleep.” The couple had to start
borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Musk’s friend Skoll, and
Riley’s parents offered to remortgage their house. Musk no longer flew his
jet back and forth between Los Angles and Silicon Valley. He took
Southwest.
Burning through about $4 million a month, Tesla needed to close
another major round of funding to get through 2008 and stay alive. Musk
had to lean on friends just to try to make payroll from week to week, as he
negotiated with investors. He sent impassioned pleas to anyone he could
think of who might be able to spare some money. Bill Lee invested $2
million in Tesla, and Sergey Brin invested $500,000. “A bunch of Tesla
employees wrote checks to keep the company going,” said Diarmuid
O’Connell, the vice president of business development at Tesla. “They
turned into investments, but, at the time, it was twenty-five or fifty thousand
dollars that you didn’t expect to see again. It just seemed like holy shit, this
thing is going to crater.” Kimbal had lost most of his money during the
recession when his investments bottomed out but sold what he had left and
put it into Tesla as well. “I was close to bankruptcy,” Kimbal said. Tesla had
set the prepayments that customers made for the Roadsters aside, but Musk
now needed to use that money to keep the company going and soon those
funds were gone, too. These fiscal maneuvers worried Kimbal. “I’m sure
Elon would have found a way to make things right, but he definitely took
risks that seemed like they could have landed him in jail for using someone
else’s money,” he said.
In December 2008, Musk mounted simultaneous campaigns to try to
save his companies. He heard a rumor that NASA was on the verge of
awarding a contract to resupply the space station. SpaceX’s fourth launch
had put it in a position to receive some of this money, which was said to be
in excess of $1 billion. Musk reached out through some back channels in
Washington and found out that SpaceX might even be a front-runner for the
deal. Musk began doing everything in his power to assure people that the
company could meet the challenge of getting a capsule to the ISS. As for
Tesla, Musk had to go to his existing investors and ask them to pony up for
another round of funding that needed to close by Christmas Eve to avoid
bankruptcy. To give the investors some measure of confidence, Musk made
a last-ditch effort to raise all the personal funds he could and put them into
the company. He took out a loan from SpaceX, which NASA approved, and
earmarked the money for Tesla. Musk went to the secondary markets to try
to sell some of his shares in SolarCity. He also seized about $15 million that
came through when Dell acquired a data center software start-up called
Everdream, founded by Musk’s cousins, in which he had invested. “It was
like the fucking Matrix,” Musk said, describing his financial maneuvers.
“The Everdream deal really saved my butt.”
Musk had cobbled together $20 million, and asked Tesla’s existing
investors—since no new investors materialized—to match that figure. The
investors agreed, and on December 3, 2008, they were in the process of
finalizing the paperwork for the funding round when Musk noticed a
problem. VantagePoint Capital Partners had signed all of the paperwork
except for one crucial page. Musk phoned up Alan Salzman, VantagePoint’s
cofounder and managing partner, to ask about the situation. Salzman
informed Musk that the firm had a problem with the investment round
because it undervalued Tesla. “I said, ‘I’ve got an excellent solution then.
Take my entire portion of the deal. I had a real hard time coming up with
the money. Based on the cash we have in the bank right now, we will
bounce payroll next week. So unless you’ve got another idea, can you either
just participate as much as you’d like, or allow the round to go through
because otherwise we will be bankrupt.’” Salzman balked and told Musk to
come in the following week at 7 A.M. to present to VantagePoint’s top brass.
Not having a week of time to work with, Musk asked to come in the next
day, and Salzman refused that offer, forcing Musk to continue taking on
loans. “The only reason he wanted the meeting at his office was for me to
come on bended knee begging for money so he could say, ‘No,’” Musk
theorized. “What a fuckhead.”
VantagePoint declined to speak about this period, but Musk believed
that Salzman’s tactics were part of a mission to bankrupt Tesla. Musk feared
that VantagePoint would oust him as CEO, recapitalize Tesla, and emerge as
the major owner of the carmaker. It could then sell Tesla to a Detroit
automaker or focus on selling electric drivetrains and battery packs instead
of making cars. Such reasoning would have been quite practical from a
business standpoint but did not match up with Musk’s goals for Tesla.
“VantagePoint was forcing that wisdom down the throat of an entrepreneur
who wanted to do something bigger and bolder,” said Steve Jurvetson, a
partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Tesla investor. “Maybe they’re used
to a CEO buckling, but Elon doesn’t do that.” Instead, Musk took another
huge risk. Tesla recharacterized the funding as a debt round rather than an
equity round, knowing that VantagePoint could not interfere with a debt
deal. The tricky part of this strategy was that investors like Jurvetson who
wanted to help Tesla were put in a bind because venture capital firms are
not structured to do debt deals, and convincing their backers to alter their
normal rules of engagement for a company that could very well go bankrupt
in a matter of days would be a very tough ask. Knowing this, Musk bluffed.
He told the investors that he would take another loan from SpaceX and fund
the entire round—all $40 million—himself. The tactic worked. “When you
have scarcity, it naturally reinforces greed and leads to more interest,”
Jurvetson said. “It was also easier for us to go back to our firms and say,
‘Here is the deal. Go or no go?’” The deal ended up closing on Christmas
Eve, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt. Musk had just a few
hundred thousand dollars left and could not have made payroll the next day.
Musk ultimately put in $12 million, and the investment firms put up the
rest. As for Salzman, Musk said, “He should be ashamed of himself.”
At SpaceX, Musk and the company’s top executives had spent most of
December in a state of fear. According to reports in the press, SpaceX, the
onetime front-runner for the large NASA contract, had suddenly lost favor
with the space agency. Michael Griffin, who had once almost been a
cofounder of SpaceX, was the head of NASA and had turned on Musk.
Griffin did not care for Musk’s aggressive business tactics, seeing him as
borderline unethical. Others have suggested that Griffin ended up being
jealous of Musk and SpaceX.* On December 23, 2008, however, SpaceX
received a shock. People inside NASA had backed SpaceX to become a
supplier for the ISS. The company received $1.6 billion as payment for
twelve flights to the space station. Staying with Kimbal in Boulder,
Colorado, for the holidays, Musk broke down in tears as the SpaceX and
Tesla transactions processed. “I hadn’t had an opportunity to buy a
Christmas present for Talulah or anything,” he said. “I went running down
the fucking street in Boulder, and the only place that was open sold these
shitty trinkets, and they were about to close. The best thing I could find
were these plastic monkeys with coconuts—those ‘see no evil, hear no evil’
monkeys.”
For Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk’s friend, the 2008
period told him everything he would ever need to know about Musk’s
character. He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who
had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his
ex-wife and who verged on having his life’s work destroyed. “He has the
ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I’ve ever met,”
Gracias said. “What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone
else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That
ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main
advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are
under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon
gets hyperrational. He’s still able to make very clear, long-term decisions.
The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went
through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I’ve just never
seen anything like his ability to take pain.”
9
LIFTOFF
THE FALCON 9 HAS BECOME SPACEX’S WORKHORSE. The rocket
looks—let’s face it—like a giant white phallus. It stands 224.4 feet tall, is
12 feet across, and weighs 1.1 million pounds. The rocket is powered by
nine engines arranged in an “octaweb” pattern at its base with one engine in
the center and eight others encircling it. The engines connect to the first
stage, or the main body of the rocket, which bears the blue SpaceX insignia
and an American flag. The shorter second stage of the rocket sits on top of
the first and is the one that actually ends up doing things in space. It can be
outfitted with a rounded container for carrying satellites or a capsule
capable of transporting humans. By design, there’s nothing particularly
flashy about the Falcon 9’s outward appearance. It’s the spaceship
equivalent of an Apple laptop or a Braun kettle—an elegant, purposeful
machine stripped of frivolity and waste.
SpaceX sometimes uses Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern
California to send up these Falcon 9 rockets. Were it not owned by the
military, the base would be a resort. The Pacific Ocean runs for miles along
its border, and its grounds have wide-open shrubby fields dotted by green
hills. Nestled into one hilly spot just at the ocean’s edge are a handful of
launchpads. On launch days, the white Falcon 9 breaks up the blue and
green landscape, pointing skyward and leaving no doubt about its
intentions.
About four hours before a launch, the Falcon 9 starts getting filled with
an immense amount of liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene. Some of
the liquid oxygen vents out of the rocket as it awaits launch and is kept so
cold that it boils off on contact with the metal and air, forming white plumes
that stream down the rocket’s sides. This gives the impression of the Falcon
9 huffing and puffing as it limbers up before the journey. The engineers
inside of SpaceX’s mission control monitor these fuel systems and all
manner of other items. They chat back and forth through headsets and begin
cycling through their launch checklist, consumed by what people in the
business call “go fever” as they move from one approval to the next. Ten
minutes before launch, the humans step out of the way and leave the
remaining processes up to automated machines. Everything goes quiet, and
the tension builds until right before the main event. That’s when, out of
nowhere, the Falcon 9 breaks the silence by letting out a loud gasp.
A white latticed support structure pulls away from its body. The Tminus-
ten-seconds countdown begins. Nothing much happens from ten
down to four. At the count of three, however, the engines ignite, and the
computers conduct a last, oh-so-rapid, health check. Four enormous metal
clamps hold the rocket down, as computing systems evaluate all nine
engines and measure if there’s sufficient downward force being produced.
By the time zero arrives, the rocket has decided that all is well enough to go
through with its mission, and the clamps release. The rocket goes to war
with inertia, and then, with flames surrounding its base and snow-thick
plumes of the liquid oxygen filling the air, it shoots up. Seeing something so
large hold so straight and steady while suspended in midair is hard for the
brain to register. It is foreign, inexplicable. About twenty seconds after
liftoff, the spectators placed safely a few miles away catch the first faceful
of the Falcon 9’s rumble. It’s a distinct sound—a sort of staccato crackling
that arises from chemicals whipped into a violent frenzy. Pant legs vibrate
from shock waves produced by a stream of sonic booms coming out of the
Falcon 9’s exhaust. The white rocket climbs higher and higher with
impressive stamina. After about a minute, it’s just a red spot in the sky, and
then—poof—it’s gone. Only a cynical dullard could come away from
witnessing this feeling anything other than wonder at what man can
accomplish.
For Elon Musk, this spectacle has turned into a familiar experience.
SpaceX has metamorphosed from the joke of the aeronautics industry into
one of its most consistent operators. SpaceX sends a rocket up about once a
month, carrying satellites for companies and nations and supplies to the
International Space Station. Where the Falcon 1 blasting off from Kwajalein
was the work of a start-up, the Falcon 9 taking off from Vandenberg is the
work of an aerospace superpower. SpaceX can undercut its U.S.
competitors—Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital Sciences—on price by a
ridiculous margin. It also offers U.S. customers a peace of mind that its
rivals can’t. Where these competitors rely on Russian and other foreign
suppliers, SpaceX makes all of its machines from scratch in the United
States. Because of its low costs, SpaceX has once again made the United
States a player in the worldwide commercial launch market. Its $60 million
per launch cost is much less than what Europe and Japan charge and trumps
even the relative bargains offered by the Russians and Chinese, who have
the added benefit of decades of sunk government investment into their
space programs as well as cheap labor.
The United States continues to take great pride in having Boeing
compete against Airbus and other foreign aircraft makers. For some reason,
though, government leaders and the public have been willing to concede
much of the commercial launch market. It’s a disheartening and
shortsighted position. The total market for satellites, related services, and
the rocket launches needed to carry them to space has exploded over the
past decade from about $60 billion per year to more than $200 billion.11 A
number of countries pay to send up their own spy, communication, and
weather satellites. Companies then turn to space for television, Internet,
radio, weather, navigation, and imaging services. The machines in space
supply the fabric of modern life, and they’re going to become more capable
and interesting at a rapid pace. A whole new breed of satellite makers has
just appeared on the scene with the ability to answer Google-like queries
about our planet. These satellites can zoom in on Iowa and determine when
cornfields are at peak yields and ready to harvest, and they can count cars in
Wal-Mart parking lots throughout California to calculate shopping demand
during the holiday season. The start-ups making these types of innovative
machines must often turn to the Russians to get them into space, but
SpaceX intends to change that.
The United States has remained competitive in the most lucrative parts
of the space industry, building the actual satellites and complementary
systems and services to run them. Each year, the United States makes about
one-third of all satellites and takes about 60 percent of the global satellite
revenue. The majority of this revenue comes from business done with the
U.S. government. China, Europe, and Russia account for almost all of the
remaining satellite sales and launches. It’s expected that China’s role in the
space industry will increase, while Russia has vowed to spend $50 billion
on revitalizing its space program. This leaves the United States dealing with
two of its least-favored nations in space matters and doing so without much
leverage. Case in point: the retirement of the space shuttle made the United
States totally dependent on the Russians to get astronauts to the ISS. Russia
gets to charge $70 million per person for the trip and to cut the United
States off as it sees fit during political rifts. At present, SpaceX looks like
the best hope of breaking this cycle and giving back to America its ability to
take people into space.
SpaceX has become the free radical trying to upend everything about
this industry. It doesn’t want to handle a few launches per year or to rely on
government contracts for survival. Musk’s goal is to use manufacturing
breakthroughs and launchpad advances to create a drastic drop in the cost of
getting things to space. Most significant, he’s been testing rockets that can
push their payload to space and then return to Earth and land with supreme
accuracy on a pad floating at sea or even their original launchpad. Instead of
having its rockets break apart after crashing into the sea, SpaceX will use
reverse thrusters to lower them down softly and reuse them. Within the next
few years, SpaceX expects to cut its price to at least one-tenth that of its
rivals. Reusing its rockets will drive the bulk of this reduction and SpaceX’s
competitive advantage. Imagine one airline that flies the same plane over
and over again, competing against others that dispose of their planes after
every flight.* Through its cost advantages, SpaceX hopes to take over the
majority of the world’s commercial launches, and there’s evidence that the
company is on its way toward doing just that. To date, it has flown satellites
for Canadian, European, and Asian customers and completed about two
dozen launches. Its public launch manifest stretches out for a number of
years, and SpaceX has more than fifty flights planned, which are all
together worth more than $5 billion. The company remains privately owned
with Musk as the largest shareholder alongside outside investors including
venture capital firms like the Founders Fund and Draper Fisher Jurvetson,
giving it a competitive ethos its rivals lack. Since getting past its near-death
experience in 2008, SpaceX has been profitable and is estimated to be
worth $12 billion.
Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, SolarCity—they are all expressions of Musk.
SpaceX is Musk. Its foibles emanate directly from him, as do its successes.
Part of this comes from Musk’s maniacal attention to detail and
involvement in every SpaceX endeavor. He’s hands-on to a degree that
would make Hugh Hefner feel inadequate. Part of it stems from SpaceX
being the apotheosis of the Cult of Musk. Employees fear Musk. They
adore Musk. The give up their lives for Musk, and they usually do all of this
simultaneously.
Musk’s demanding management style can only flourish because of the
otherworldly—in a literal sense—aspirations of the company. While the rest
of the aerospace industry has been content to keep sending what look like
relics from the 1960s into space, SpaceX has made a point of doing just the
opposite. Its reusable rockets and reusable spaceships look like true twentyfirst-
century machines. The modernization of the equipment is not just for
show. It reflects SpaceX’s constant push to advance its technology and
change the economics of the industry. Musk does not simply want to lower
the cost of deploying satellites and resupplying the space station. He wants
to lower the cost of launches to the point that it becomes economical and
practical to fly thousands upon thousands of supply trips to Mars and start a
colony. Musk wants to conquer the solar system, and, as it stands, there’s
just one company where you can work if that sort of quest gets you out of
bed in the morning.
It seems unfathomable, but the rest of the space industry has made space
boring. The Russians, who dominate much of the business of sending things
and people to space, do so with decades-old equipment. The cramped Soyuz
capsule that takes people to the space station has mechanical knobs and
computer screens that appear unchanged from its inaugural 1966 flight.
Countries new to the space race have mimicked the antiquated Russian and
American equipment with maddening accuracy. When young people get
into the aerospace industry, they’re forced to either laugh or cry at the state
of the machines. Nothing sucks the fun out of working on a spaceship like
controlling it with mechanisms last seen in a 1960s laundromat. And the
actual work environment is as outmoded as the machines. Hotshot college
graduates have historically been forced to pick between a variety of slowmoving
military contractors and interesting but ineffectual start-ups.
Musk has managed to take these negatives surrounding the aerospace
business and turn them into gains for SpaceX. He’s presented the company
as anything but another aerospace contractor. SpaceX is the hip, forwardthinking
place that’s brought the perks of Silicon Valley—namely frozen
yogurt, stock options, speedy decision making, and a flat corporate structure
—to a staid industry. People who know Musk well tend to describe him
more as a general than a CEO, and this is apt. He’s built an engineering
army by having the pick of just about anyone in the business that SpaceX
wants.
The SpaceX hiring model places some emphasis on getting top marks at
top schools. But most of the attention goes toward spotting engineers who
have exhibited type A personality traits over the course of their lives. The
company’s recruiters look for people who might excel at robot-building
competitions or who are car-racing hobbyists who have built unusual
vehicles. The object is to find individuals who ooze passion, can work well
as part of a team, and have real-world experience bending metal. “Even if
you’re someone who writes code for your job, you need to understand how
mechanical things work,” said Dolly Singh, who spent five years as the
head of talent acquisition at SpaceX. “We were looking for people that had
been building things since they were little.”
Sometimes these people walked through the front door. Other times,
Singh relied on a handful of enterprising techniques to find them. She
became famous for trawling through academic papers to find engineers with
very specific skills, cold-calling researchers at labs and plucking possessed
engineers out of college. At trade shows and conferences, SpaceX recruiters
wooed interesting candidates they had spotted with a cloak-and-dagger
shtick. They would hand out blank envelopes that contained invitations to
meet at a specific time and place, usually a bar or restaurant near the event,
for an initial interview. The candidates that showed up would discover they
were among only a handful of people who been anointed out of all the
conference attendees. They were immediately made to feel special and
inspired.
Like many tech companies, SpaceX subjects potential hires to a gauntlet
of interviews and tests. Some of the interviews are easygoing chats in which
both parties get to feel each other out; others are filled with quizzes that can
be quite hard. Engineers tend to face the most rigorous interrogations,
although business types and salesmen are made to suffer, too. Coders who
expect to pass through standard challenges have rude awakenings.
Companies will typically challenge software developers on the spot by
asking them to solve problems that require a couple of dozen lines of code.
The standard SpaceX problem requires five hundred or more lines of code.
All potential employees who make their way to the end of the interview
process then handle one more task. They’re asked to write an essay for
Musk about why they want to work at SpaceX.
The reward for solving the puzzles, acting clever in interviews, and
penning up a good essay is a meeting with Musk. He interviewed almost
every one of SpaceX’s first one thousand hires, including the janitors and
technicians, and has continued to interview the engineers as the company’s
workforce swelled. Each employee receives a warning before going to meet
with Musk. The interview, he or she is told, could last anywhere from thirty
seconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing e-mails and
working during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don’t
panic. That’s normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face
you. Even then, though, he might not make actual eye contact with you or
fully acknowledge your presence. Don’t panic. That’s normal. In due course,
he will speak to you. From that point, the tales of engineers who have
interviewed with Musk run the gamut from torturous experiences to the
sublime. He might ask one question or he might ask several. You can be
sure, though, that he will roll out the Riddle: “You’re standing on the
surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile
north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?” One answer
to that is the North Pole, and most of the engineers get it right away. That’s
when Musk will follow with “Where else could you be?” The other answer
is somewhere close to the South Pole where, if you walk one mile south, the
circumference of the Earth becomes one mile. Fewer engineers get this
answer, and Musk will happily walk them through that riddle and others and
cite any relevant equations during his explanations. He tends to care less
about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they
describe the problem and their approach to solving it.
When speaking to potential recruits, Singh tried to energize them and be
up front about the demands of SpaceX and of Musk at the same time. “The
recruiting pitch was SpaceX is special forces,” she said. “If you want as
hard as it gets, then great. If not, then you shouldn’t come here.” Once at
SpaceX, the new employees found out very quickly if they were indeed up
for the challenge. Many of them would quit within the first few months
because of the ninety-plus-hour workweeks. Others quit because they could
not handle just how direct Musk and the other executives were during
meetings. “Elon doesn’t know about you and he hasn’t thought through
whether or not something is going to hurt your feelings,” Singh said. “He
just knows what the fuck he wants done. People who did not normalize to
his communication style did not do well.”
There’s an impression that SpaceX suffers from incredibly high
turnover, and the company has without question churned through a fair
number of bodies. Many of the key executives who helped start the
company, however, have hung on for a decade or more. Among the rankand-
file engineers, most people stay on for at least five years to have their
stock options vest and to see their projects through. This is typical behavior
for any technology company. SpaceX and Musk also seem to inspire an
unusual level of loyalty. Musk has managed to conjure up that Steve Jobs–
like zeal among his troops. “His vision is so clear,” Singh said. “He almost
hypnotizes you. He gives you the crazy eye, and it’s like, yes, we can get to
Mars.” Take that a bit further and you arrive at a pleasure-pain,
sadomasochistic vibe that comes with working for Musk. Numerous people
interviewed for this book decried the work hours, Musk’s blunt style, and
his sometimes ludicrous expectations. Yet almost every person—even those
who had been fired—still worshipped Musk and talked about him in terms
usually reserved for superheroes or deities.
SpaceX’s original headquarters in El Segundo were not quite up to the
company’s desired image as a place where the cool kids want to work. This
is not a problem for SpaceX’s new facility in Hawthorne. The building’s
address is 1 Rocket Road, and it has the Hawthorne Municipal Airport and
several tooling and manufacturing companies as neighbors. While the
SpaceX building resembles the others in size and shape, its all-white color
makes it the obvious outlier. The structure looks like a gargantuan,
rectangular glacier that’s been planted in the midst of a particularly soulless
portion of Los Angeles County’s sprawl.
Visitors to SpaceX have to walk past a security guard and through a
small executive parking lot where Musk parks his black Model S, which
flanks the building’s entryway. The front doors are reflective and hide
what’s on the inside, which is more white. There are white walls in the
foyer, a funky white table in the waiting area, and a white check-in desk
with a pair of orchids sitting in white pots. After going through the
registration process, guests are given a name badge and led into the main
SpaceX office space. Musk’s cubicle—a supersize unit—sits to the right
where he has a couple of celebratory Aviation Week magazine covers up on
the wall, pictures of his boys, next to a huge flat-screen monitor, and
various knickknacks on his desk, including a boomerang, some books, a
bottle of wine, and a giant samurai sword named Lady Vivamus, which
Musk received when he won the Heinlein Prize, an award given for big
achievements in commercial space. Hundreds of other people work in
cubicles amid the big, wide-open area, most of them executives, engineers,
software developers, and salespeople tapping away on their computers. The
conference rooms that surround their desks all have space-themed names
like Apollo or Wernher von Braun and little nameplates that explain the
label’s significance. The largest conference rooms have ultramodern chairs
—high-backed, sleek red jobs that surround large glass tables—while
panoramic photos of a Falcon 1 taking off from Kwaj or the Dragon capsule
docking with the ISS hang on the walls in the background.
Take away the rocket swag and the samurai sword and this central part
of the SpaceX office looks just like what you might find at your run-of-themill
Silicon Valley headquarters. The same thing cannot be said for what
visitors encounter as they pass through a pair of double doors into the heart
of the SpaceX factory.
The 550,000-square-foot factory floor is difficult to process at first
glance. It’s one continuous space with grayish epoxied floors, white walls,
and white support columns. A small city’s worth of stuff—people,
machines, noise—has been piled into this area. Just near the entryway, one
of the Dragon capsules that has gone to the ISS and returned to Earth hangs
from the ceiling with black burn marks running down its side. Just under the
capsule on the ground are a pair of the twenty-five-foot-long landing legs
built by SpaceX to let the Falcon rocket come to a gentle rest on the ground
after a flight so it can be flown again. To the left side of this entryway area
there’s a kitchen, and to the right side there’s the mission control room. It’s
a closed-off area with expansive glass windows and fronted by wall-size
screens for tracking a rocket’s progress. It has four rows of desks with about
ten computers each for the mission control staff. Step a bit farther into the
factory and there are a handful of industrial work areas separated from each
other in the most informal of ways. In some spots there are blue lines on the
floor to mark off an area and in other spots blue workbenches have been
arranged in squares to cordon off the space. It’s a common sight to have one
of the Merlin engines raised up in the middle of one of these work areas
with a half dozen technicians wiring it up and tuning its bits and pieces.
Just behind these workspaces is a glass-enclosed square big enough to
fit two of the Dragon capsules. This is a clean room where people must
wear lab coats and hairnets to fiddle with the capsules without
contaminating them. About forty feet to the left, there are several Falcon 9
rockets lying next to each other horizontally that have been painted and
await transport. There are some areas tucked in between all of this that have
blue walls and appear to have been covered by fabric. These are top-secret
zones where SpaceX might be working on a fanciful astronaut’s outfit or
rocket part that it has to hide from visitors and employees not tied to the
projects. There’s a large area off to the side where SpaceX builds all of its
electronics, another area for creating specialized composite materials, and
another for making the bus-sized fairings that wrap around the satellites.
Hundreds of people move about at the same time through the factory—a
mix of gritty technicians with tattoos and bandanas, and young, white-collar
engineers. The sweaty smell of kids who have just come off the playground
permeates the building and hints at its nonstop activity.
Musk has left his personal touches throughout the factory. There are
small things like the data center that has been bathed in blue lights to give it
a sci-fi feel. The refrigerator-sized computers under the lights have been
labeled with big block letters to make it look like they were made by
Cyberdyne Systems, the fictional company from the Terminator movie
franchise. Near the elevators, Musk has placed a glowing life-size Iron Man
figure. Surely the factory’s most Muskian element is the office space that
has been built smack-dab in its center. This is a three-story glass structure
with meeting rooms and desks that rises up between various welding and
construction areas. It looks and feels bizarre to have a see-through office
inside this hive of industry. Musk, though, wanted his engineers to watch
what was going on with the machines at all times and to make sure they had
to walk through the factory and talk to the technicians on the way to their
desks.
The factory is a temple devoted to what SpaceX sees as its major
weapon in the rocket-building game, in-house manufacturing. SpaceX
manufactures between 80 percent and 90 percent of its rockets, engines,
electronics, and other parts. It’s a strategy that flat-out dumbfounds
SpaceX’s competitors, like United Launch Alliance, or ULA, which openly
brags about depending on more than 1,200 suppliers to make its end
products. (ULA, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, sees
itself as an engine of job creation rather than a model of inefficiency.)
A typical aerospace company comes up with the list of parts that it
needs for a launch system and then hands off their design and specifications
to myriad third parties who then actually build the hardware. SpaceX tends
to buy as little as possible to save money and because it sees depending on
suppliers—especially foreign ones—as a weakness. This approach comes
off as excessive at first blush. Companies have made things like radios and
power distribution units for decades. Reinventing the wheel for every
computer and machine on a rocket could introduce more chances for error
and, in general, be a waste of time. But for SpaceX, the strategy works. In
addition to building its own engines, rocket bodies, and capsules, SpaceX
designs its own motherboards and circuits, sensors to detect vibrations,
flight computers, and solar panels. Just by streamlining a radio, for instance,
SpaceX’s engineers have found that they can reduce the weight of the
device by about 20 percent. And the cost savings for a homemade radio are
dramatic, dropping from between $50,000 to $100,000 for the industrialgrade
equipment used by aerospace companies to $5,000 for SpaceX’s unit.
It’s hard to believe these kinds of price differentials at first, but there are
dozens if not hundreds of places where SpaceX has secured such savings.
The equipment at SpaceX tends to be built out of readily available
consumer electronics as opposed to “space grade” equipment used by others
in the industry. SpaceX has had to work for years to prove to NASA that
standard electronics have gotten good enough to compete with the more
expensive, specialized gear trusted in years past. “Traditional aerospace has
been doing things the same way for a very, very long time,” said Drew
Eldeen, a former SpaceX engineer. “The biggest challenge was convincing
NASA to give something new a try and building a paper trail that showed
the parts were high enough quality.” To prove that it’s making the right
choice to NASA and itself, SpaceX will sometimes load a rocket with both
the standard equipment and prototypes of its own design for testing during
flight. Engineers then compare the performance characteristics of the
devices. Once a SpaceX design equals or outperforms the commercial
products, it becomes the de facto hardware.
There have also been numerous times when SpaceX has done
pioneering work on advancing very complex hardware systems. A classic
example of this is one of the factory’s weirder-looking contraptions, a twostory
machine designed to perform what’s known as friction stir welding.
The machine allows SpaceX to automate the welding process for massive
sheets of metal like the ones that make up the bodies of the Falcon rockets.
An arm takes one of the rocket’s body panels, lines it up against another
body panel, and then joins them together with a weld that could run twenty
feet or more. Aerospace companies typically try to avoid welds whenever
possible because they create weaknesses in the metal, and that’s limited the
size of metal sheets they can use and forced other design constraints. From
the early days of SpaceX, Musk pushed the company to master friction stir
welding, in which a spinning head is smashed at high speeds into the join
between two pieces of metal in a bid to make their crystalline structures
merge. It’s as if you heated two sheets of aluminum foil and then joined
them by putting your thumb down on the seam and twisting the metal
together. This type of welding tends to result in much stronger bonds than
traditional welds. Companies had performed friction stir welding before but
not on structures as large as a rocket’s body or to the degree to which
SpaceX has used the technique. As a result of its trials and errors, SpaceX
can now join large, thin sheets of metal and shave hundreds of pounds off
the weight of the Falcon rockets, as it’s able to use lighter-weight alloys and
avoid using rivets, fasteners, and other support structures. Musk’s
competitors in the auto industry might soon need to do the same because
SpaceX has transferred some of the equipment and techniques to Tesla. The
hope is that Tesla will be able to make lighter, stronger cars.
The technology has proven so valuable that SpaceX’s competitors have
started to copy it and have tried to poach some of the company’s experts in
the field. Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s secretive rocket company, has been
particularly aggressive, hiring away Ray Miryekta, one of the world’s
foremost friction stir welding experts and igniting a major rift with Musk.
“Blue Origin does these surgical strikes on specialized talent* offering like
double their salaries. I think it’s unnecessary and a bit rude,” Musk said.
Within SpaceX, Blue Origin is mockingly referred to as BO and at one
point the company created an e-mail filter to detect messages with “blue”
and “origin” to block the poaching. The relationship between Musk and
Bezos has soured, and they no longer chat about their shared ambition of
getting to Mars. “I do think Bezos has an insatiable desire to be King
Bezos,” Musk said. “He has a relentless work ethic and wants to kill
everything in e-commerce. But he’s not the most fun guy, honestly.”*
In the early days of SpaceX, Musk knew little about the machines and
amount of grunt work that goes into making rockets. He rebuffed requests
to buy specialized tooling equipment, until the engineers could explain in
clear terms why they needed certain things and until experience taught him
better. Musk also had yet to master some of the management techniques for
which he would become both famous and to some degree infamous.
Musk’s growth as a CEO and rocket expert occurred alongside
SpaceX’s maturation as a company. At the start of the Falcon 1 journey,
Musk was a forceful software executive trying to learn some basic things
about a very different world. At Zip2 and PayPal, he felt comfortable
standing up for his positions and directing teams of coders. At SpaceX, he
had to pick things up on the job. Musk initially relied on textbooks to form
the bulk of his rocketry knowledge. But as SpaceX hired one brilliant
person after another, Musk realized he could tap into their stores of
knowledge. He would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to
work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. “I thought at
first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said Kevin
Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn
things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you
know.” People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his
abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless
recall. It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to
work just as well in the present day as it did when he was a child
vacuuming books into his brain. After a couple of years running SpaceX,
Musk had turned into an aerospace expert on a level that few technology
CEOs ever approach in their respective fields. “He was teaching us about
the value of time, and we were teaching him about rocketry,” Brogan said.
In regards to time, Musk may well set more aggressive delivery targets
for very difficult-to-make products than any executive in history. Both his
employees and the public have found this to be one of the more jarring
aspects of Musk’s character. “Elon has always been optimistic,” Brogan
said. “That’s the nice word. He can be a downright liar about when things
need to get done. He will pick the most aggressive time schedule
imaginable assuming everything goes right, and then accelerate it by
assuming that everyone can work harder.”
Musk has been pilloried by the press for setting and then missing
product delivery dates. It’s one of the habits that got him in the most trouble
as SpaceX and Tesla tried to bring their first products to market. Time and
again, Musk found himself making a public appearance where he had to
come up with a new batch of excuses for a delay. Reminded about the initial
2003 target date to fly the Falcon 1, Musk acted shocked. “Are you
serious?” he said. “We said that? Okay, that’s ridiculous. I think I just didn’t
know what the hell I was talking about. The only thing I had prior
experience in was software, and, yeah, you can write a bunch of software
and launch a website in a year. No problem. This isn’t like software. It
doesn’t work that way with rockets.” Musk simply cannot help himself.
He’s an optimist by nature, and it can feel like he makes calculations for
how long it will take to do something based on the idea that things will
progress without flaw at every step and that all the members of his team
have Muskian abilities and work ethics. As Brogan joked, Musk might
forecast how long a software project will take by timing the amount of
seconds needed physically to write a line of code and then extrapolating that
out to match however many lines of code he expects the final piece of
software to be. It’s an imperfect analogy but one that does not seem that far
off from Musk’s worldview. “Everything he does is fast,” Brogan said. “He
pees fast. It’s like a fire hose—three seconds and out. He’s authentically in a
hurry.”
Asked about his approach, Musk said,
I certainly don’t try to set impossible goals. I think impossible
goals are demotivating. You don’t want to tell people to go through a
wall by banging their head against it. I don’t ever set intentionally
impossible goals. But I’ve certainly always been optimistic on time
frames. I’m trying to recalibrate to be a little more realistic.
I don’t assume that it’s just like 100 of me or something like that.
I mean, in the case of the early SpaceX days, it would have been just
the lack of understanding of what it takes to develop a rocket. In that
case I was off by, say, 200 percent. I think future programs might be
off by anywhere from like 25 percent to 50 percent as opposed to
200 percent.
So, I think generally you do want to have a timeline where,
based on everything you know about, the schedule should be X, and
you execute towards that, but with the understanding that there will
be all sorts of things that you don’t know about that you will
encounter that will push the date beyond that. It doesn’t mean that
you shouldn’t have tried to aim for that date from the beginning
because aiming for something else would have been an arbitrary
time increase.
It’s different to say, “Well, what do you promise people?”
Because you want to try to promise people something that includes
schedule margin. But in order to achieve the external promised
schedule, you’ve got to have an internal schedule that’s more
aggressive than that. Sometimes you still miss the external schedule.
SpaceX, by the way, is not alone here. Being late is par for the
course in the aerospace industry. It’s not a question of if it’s late, it’s
how late will the program be. I don’t think an aerospace program
has been completed on time since bloody World War II.
Dealing with the epically aggressive schedules and Musk’s expectations
has required SpaceX’s engineers to develop a variety of survival techniques.
Musk often asks for highly detailed proposals for how projects will be
accomplished. The employees have learned never to break the time needed
to accomplish something down into months or weeks. Musk wants day-byday
and hour-by-hour forecasts and sometimes even minute-by-minute
countdowns, and the fallout from missed schedules is severe. “You had to
put in when you would go to the bathroom,” Brogan said. “I’m like, ‘Elon,
sometimes people need to take a long dump.’” SpaceX’s top managers work
together to, in essence, create fake schedules that they know will please
Musk but that are basically impossible to achieve. This would not be such a
horrible situation if the targets were kept internal. Musk, however, tends to
quote these fake schedules to customers, unintentionally giving them false
hope. Typically, it falls to Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president, to clean
up the resulting mess. She will either need to ring up a customer to give
them a more realistic timeline or concoct a litany of excuses to explain
away the inevitable delays. “Poor Gwynne,” Brogan said. “Just to hear her
on the phone with the customers is agonizing.”
There can be no question that Musk has mastered the art of getting the
most out of his employees. Interview three dozen SpaceX engineers and
each one of them will have picked up on a managerial nuance that Musk has
used to get people to meet his deadlines. One example from Brogan: Where
a typical manager may set the deadline for the employee, Musk guides his
engineers into taking ownership of their own delivery dates. “He doesn’t
say, ‘You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.,’” Brogan said. “He says, ‘I
need the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?’ Then, when
you say yes, you are not working hard because he told you to. You’re
working hard for yourself. It’s a distinction you can feel. You have signed
up to do your own work.” And by recruiting hundreds of bright, selfmotivated
people, SpaceX has maximized the power of the individual. One
person putting in a sixteen-hour day ends up being much more effective
than two people working eight-hour days together. The individual doesn’t
have to hold meetings, reach a consensus, or bring other people up to speed
on a project. He just keeps working and working and working. The ideal
SpaceX employee is someone like Steve Davis, the director of advanced
projects at SpaceX. “He’s been working sixteen hours a day every day for
years,” Brogan said. “He gets more done than eleven people working
together.”
To find Davis, Musk called a teaching assistant* in Stanford’s
aeronautics department and asked him if there were any hardworking,
bright master’s and doctoral candidates who didn’t have families. The TA
pointed Musk to Davis, who was pursuing a master’s degree in aerospace
engineering to add to degrees in finance, mechanical engineering, and
particle physics. Musk called Davis on a Wednesday and offered him a job
the following Friday. Davis was the twenty-second SpaceX hire and has
ended up the twelfth most senior person still at the company. He turned
thirty-five in 2014.
Davis did his tour of duty on Kwaj and considered it the greatest time of
his life. “Every night, you could either sleep by the rocket in this tent shelter
where the geckos crawled all over you or take this one-hour boat ride that
made you seasick back to the main island,” he said. “Every night, you had
to pick the pain that you remembered least. You got so hot and exhausted. It
was just amazing.” After working on the Falcon 1, Davis moved to the
Falcon 9 and then Dragon.
The Dragon capsule took SpaceX four years to design. It’s likely the
fastest project of its ilk done in the history of the aerospace industry. The
project started with Musk and a handful of engineers, most of them under
thirty years old, and peaked at one hundred people.* They cribbed from past
capsule work and read over every paper published by NASA and other
aeronautics bodies around projects like Gemini and Apollo. “If you go
search for something like Apollo’s reentry guidance algorithm, there are
these great databases that will just spit out the answer,” Davis said. The
engineers at SpaceX then had to figure out how to advance these past efforts
and bring the capsule into the modern age. Some of the areas of
improvement were obvious and easily accomplished, while others required
more ingenuity. Saturn 5 and Apollo had colossal computing bays that
produced only a fraction of the computer horsepower that can be achieved
today on, say, an iPad. The SpaceX engineers knew they could save a lot of
room by cutting out some of the computers while also adding capabilities
with their more powerful equipment. The engineers decided that while
Dragon would look a lot like Apollo, it would have steeper wall angles, to
clear space for gear and for the astronauts that the company hoped to fly.
SpaceX also got the recipe for its heat shield material, called PICA, through
a deal with NASA. The SpaceX engineers found out how to make the PICA
material less expensively and improved the underlying recipe so that
Dragon—from day one—could withstand the heat of a reentry coming back
from Mars.* The total cost for Dragon came in at $300 million, which
would be on the order of 10 to 30 times less than capsule projects built by
other companies. “The metal comes in, we roll it out, weld it, and make
things,” Davis said. “We build almost everything in-house. That is why the
costs have come down.”
Davis, like Brogan and plenty of other SpaceX engineers, has had Musk
ask for the seemingly impossible. His favorite request dates back to 2004.
SpaceX needed an actuator that would trigger the gimbal action used to
steer the upper stage of Falcon 1. Davis had never built a piece of hardware
before in his life and naturally went out to find some suppliers who could
make an electromechanical actuator for him. He got a quote back for
$120,000. “Elon laughed,” Davis said. “He said, ‘That part is no more
complicated than a garage door opener. Your budget is five thousand
dollars. Go make it work.’” Davis spent nine months building the actuator.
At the end of the process, he toiled for three hours writing an e-mail to
Musk covering the pros and cons of the device. The e-mail went into gory
detail about how Davis had designed the part, why he had made various
choices, and what its cost would be. As he pressed send, Davis felt anxiety
surge through his body knowing that he’d given his all for almost a year to
do something an engineer at another aerospace company would not even
attempt. Musk rewarded all of this toil and angst with one of his standard
responses. He wrote back, “Ok.” The actuator Davis designed ended up
costing $3,900 and flew with Falcon 1 into space. “I put every ounce of
intellectual capital I had into that e-mail and one minute later got that
simple response,” Davis said. “Everyone in the company was having that
same experience. One of my favorite things about Elon is his ability to
make enormous decisions very quickly. That is still how it works today.”
Kevin Watson can attest to that. He arrived at SpaceX in 2008 after
spending twenty-four years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Watson
worked on a wide variety of projects at JPL, including building and testing
computing systems that could withstand the harsh conditions of space. JPL
would typically buy expensive, specially toughened computers, and this
frustrated Watson. He daydreamed about ways to handcraft much cheaper,
equally effective computers. While having his job interview with Musk,
Watson learned that SpaceX needed just this type of thinking. Musk wanted
the bulk of a rocket’s computing systems to cost no more than $10,000. It
was an insane figure by aerospace industry standards, where the avionics
systems for a rocket typically cost well over $10 million. “In traditional
aerospace, it would cost you more than ten thousand dollars just for the
food at a meeting to discuss the cost of the avionics,” Watson said.
During the job interview, Watson promised Musk that he could do the
improbable and deliver the $10,000 avionics system. He began working on
making the computers for Dragon right after being hired. The first system
was called CUCU, pronounced “cuckoo.” This communications box would
go inside the International Space Station and communicate back with
Dragon. A number of people at NASA referred to the SpaceX engineers as
“the guys in the garage” and were cynical about the start-up’s ability to do
much of anything, including building this type of machine. But SpaceX
produced the communication computer in record time, and it ended up as
the first system of its kind to pass NASA’s protocol tests on the first try.
NASA officials were forced to say “cuckoo” over and over again during
meetings—a small act of defiance SpaceX had planned all along to torture
NASA. As the months went on, Watson and other engineers built out the
complete computing systems for Dragon and then adapted the technology
for Falcon 9. The result was a fully redundant avionics platform that used a
mix of off-the-shelf computing gear and products built in-house by SpaceX.
It cost a bit more than $10,000 but came close to meeting Musk’s goal.
SpaceX reinvigorated Watson, who had become disenchanted with
JPL’s acceptance of wasteful spending and bureaucracy. Musk had to sign
off on every expenditure over $10,000. “It was his money that we were
spending, and he was keeping an eye on it, as he damn well should,”
Watson said. “He made sure nothing stupid was happening.” Decisions
were made quickly during weekly meetings, and the entire company bought
into them. “It was amazing how fast people would adapt to what came out
of those meetings,” Watson said. “The entire ship could turn ninety degrees
instantly. Lockheed Martin could never do anything like that.” Watson
continued:
Elon is brilliant. He’s involved in just about everything. He
understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very
quickly not to go give him a gut reaction. He wants answers that get
down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands
really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like
nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy. He
can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can
make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve
all these equations in real time. It’s amazing to watch the amount of
knowledge he has accumulated over the years. I don’t want to be the
person who ever has to compete with Elon. You might as well leave
the business and find something else fun to do. He will outmaneuver
you, outthink you, and out-execute you.
One of Watson’s top discoveries at SpaceX was the test bed on the third
floor of the Hawthorne factory. SpaceX has test versions of all the hardware
and electronics that go into a rocket laid out on metal tables. It has in effect
replicated the innards of a rocket end to end in order to run thousands of
flight simulations. Someone “launches” the rocket from a computer and
then every piece of mechanical and computing hardware is monitored with
sensors. An engineer can tell a valve to open, then check to see if it opened,
how quickly it opened, and the level of current running to it. This testing
apparatus lets SpaceX engineers practice ahead of launches and figure out
how they would deal with all manner of anomalies. During the actual
flights, SpaceX has people in the test facility who can replicate errors seen
on Falcon or Dragon and make adjustments accordingly. SpaceX has made
numerous changes on the fly with this system. In one case someone spotted
an error in a software file in the hours right before a launch. SpaceX’s
engineers changed the file, checked how it affected the test hardware, and,
when no problems were detected, sent the file to the Falcon 9, waiting on
the launchpad, all in less than thirty minutes. “NASA wasn’t used to this,”
Watson said. “If something went wrong with the shuttle, everyone was just
resigned to waiting three weeks before they could try and launch again.”12
From time to time, Musk will send out an e-mail to the entire company
to enforce a new policy or let them know about something that’s bothering
him. One of the more famous e-mails arrived in May 2010 with the subject
line: Acronyms Seriously Suck:
There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX.
Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to
communication and keeping communication good as we grow is
incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there
may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up,
over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to
new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms
and people don’t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit
there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.
That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action—I
have given enough warnings over the years. Unless an acronym is
approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary. If there is
an existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be
eliminated, as I have requested in the past.
For example, there should be no “HTS” [horizontal test stand] or
“VTS” [vertical test stand] designations for test stands. Those are
particularly dumb, as they contain unnecessary words. A “stand” at
our test site is obviously a *test* stand. VTS-3 is four syllables
compared with “Tripod,” which is two, so the bloody acronym
version actually takes longer to say than the name!
The key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts
communication. An acronym that most engineers outside of SpaceX
already know, such as GUI, is fine to use. It is also ok to make up a
few acronyms/contractions every now and again, assuming I have
approved them, eg MVac and M9 instead of Merlin 1C-Vacuum or
Merlin 1C-Sea Level, but those need to be kept to a minimum.
This was classic Musk. The e-mail is rough in its tone and yet not really
unwarranted for a guy who just wants things done as efficiently as possible.
It obsesses over something that other people might find trivial and yet he
has a definite point. It’s comical in that Musk wants all acronym approvals
to run directly through him, but that’s entirely in keeping with the hands-on
management style that has, mainly, worked well at both SpaceX and Tesla.
Employees have since dubbed the acronym policy the ASS Rule.
The guiding principle at SpaceX is to embrace your work and get stuff
done. People who await guidance or detailed instructions languish. The
same goes for workers who crave feedback. And the absolute worst thing
that someone can do is inform Musk that what he’s asking is impossible. An
employee could be telling Musk that there’s no way to get the cost on
something like that actuator down to where he wants it or that there is
simply not enough time to build a part by Musk’s deadline. “Elon will say,
‘Fine. You’re off the project, and I am now the CEO of the project. I will do
your job and be CEO of two companies at the same time. I will deliver it,’”
Brogan said. “What’s crazy is that Elon actually does it. Every time he’s
fired someone and taken their job, he’s delivered on whatever the project
was.”
It is jarring for both parties when the SpaceX culture rubs against more
bureaucratic bodies like NASA, the U.S. Air Force, and the Federal
Aviation Administration. The first inklings of these difficulties appeared on
Kwaj, where government officials sometimes questioned what they saw as
SpaceX’s cavalier approach to the launch process. There were times when
SpaceX would want to make a change to its launch procedures and any such
change would require a pile of paperwork. SpaceX, for example, would
have written down all the steps needed to replace a filter—put on gloves,
wear safety goggles, remove a nut—and then want to alter this procedure or
use a different type of filter. The FAA would need a week to review the new
process before SpaceX could actually go about changing the filter on the
rocket, a lag that both the engineers and Musk found ridiculous. On one
occasion after this type of thing happened, Musk laid into an FAA official
while on a conference call with members of the SpaceX team and NASA.
“It got hot and heated, and he berated this guy on a personal level for like
ten minutes,” Brogan said.
Musk did not recall this incident but did remember other confrontations
with the FAA. One time he compiled a list of things an FAA subordinate
had said during a meeting that Musk found silly and sent the list along to
the guy’s boss. “And then his dingbat manager sent me this long e-mail
about how he had been in the shuttle program and in charge of twenty
launches or something like that and how dare I say that the other guy was
wrong,” Musk said. “I told him, ‘Not only is he wrong, and let me
rearticulate the reasons, but you’re wrong, and let me articulate the
reasons.’ I don’t think he sent me another e-mail after that. We’re trying to
have a really big impact on the space industry. If the rules are such that you
can’t make progress, then you have to fight the rules.
“There is a fundamental problem with regulators. If a regulator agrees to
change a rule and something bad happens, they could easily lose their
career. Whereas if they change a rule and something good happens, they
don’t even get a reward. So, it’s very asymmetric. It’s then very easy to
understand why regulators resist changing the rules. It’s because there’s a
big punishment on one side and no reward on the other. How would any
rational person behave in such a scenario?”
In the middle of 2009, SpaceX hired Ken Bowersox, a former astronaut,
as its vice president of astronaut safety and mission assurance. Bowersox fit
the mold of recruit prized by a classic big aerospace company. He had a
degree in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy, had been a
test pilot in the air force, and flew on the space shuttle a handful of times.
Many people within SpaceX saw his arrival at the company as a good thing.
He was considered a diligent, dignified sort who would provide a second set
of eyes to many of SpaceX’s procedures, checking to make sure the
company went about things in a safe, standardized manner. Bowersox ended
up smack in the middle of the constant pull and push at SpaceX between
doing things efficiently and agonizing over traditional procedures. He and
Musk were increasingly at odds as the months passed, and Bowersox started
to feel as if his opinions were being ignored. During one incident in
particular, a part made it all the way to the test stand with a major flaw—
described by one engineer as the equivalent of a coffee cup not having a
bottom—instead of being caught at the factory. According to observers,
Bowersox argued that SpaceX should go back and investigate the process
that led to the mistake and fix its root cause. Musk had already decided that
he knew the basis of the problem and dismissed Bowersox after a couple of
years on the job. (Bowersox declined to speak on the record about his time
at SpaceX.) A number of people inside SpaceX saw the Bowersox incident
as an example of Musk’s hard-charging manner undermining some muchneeded
process. Musk had a totally different take on the situation, casting
Bowersox as not being up to the engineering demands at SpaceX.
A handful of high-ranking government officials gave me their candid
takes on Musk, albeit without being willing to put their names to the
remarks. One found Musk’s treatment of air force generals and military men
of similar rank appalling. Musk has been known to let even high-ranking
officials have it when he thinks they’re off base and is not apologetic about
this. Another could not believe it when Musk would call very intelligent
people idiots. “Imagine the worst possible way that could come out, and it
would come out,” this person said. “Life with Elon is like being in a very
intimate married couple. He can be so gentle and loyal and then really hard
on people when it isn’t necessary.” One former official felt that Musk would
need to temper himself better in the years to come if SpaceX was to keep
currying favor with the military and government agencies in its bid to defeat
the incumbent contractors. “His biggest enemy will be himself and the way
he treats people,” this person said.
When Musk rubs outsiders the wrong way, Shotwell is often there to try
to smooth over the situation. Like Musk, she has a salty tongue and a fiery
personality, but Shotwell is willing to play the role of the conciliator. These
skills have allowed her to handle the day-to-day operations at SpaceX,
leaving Musk to focus on the company’s overall strategy, the product
designs, marketing, and motivating employees. Like all of Musk’s most
trusted lieutenants, Shotwell has been willing to stay largely in the
background, do her work, and focus on the company’s cause.
Shotwell grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, the daughter of an artist
(mom) and a neurosurgeon (dad). She played the part of a bright, pretty girl,
getting straight A’s at school and joining the cheerleading squad. Shotwell
had not expressed a major inclination toward the sciences and knew only
one version of an engineer—the guy who drives a train. But there were
clues that she was wired a bit different. She was the daughter who mowed
the lawn and helped put the family basketball hoop together. In third grade,
Shotwell developed a brief interest in car engines, and her mom bought a
book detailing how they work. Later, in high school, Shotwell’s mom
forced her to attend a lecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology on a
Saturday afternoon. As Shotwell listened to one of the panels, she grew
enamored with a fifty-year-old mechanical engineer. “She had these
beautiful clothes, this suit and shoes that I loved,” Shotwell said. “She was
tall and carried off the heels really well.” Shotwell chatted with the engineer
after the talk, learning about her job. “That was the day I decided to become
a mechanical engineer,” she said.
Shotwell went on to receive an undergraduate degree in mechanical
engineering and a master’s degree in applied mathematics from
Northwestern University. Then she took a job at Chrysler. It was a type of
management training program meant for hotshot recent graduates who
appeared to have leadership potential. Shotwell started out going to auto
mechanics school—“I loved that”—and then from department to
department. While working on engines research, Shotwell found that there
were two very expensive Cray supercomputers sitting idle because none of
the veterans knew how to use them. A short while later, she logged onto the
computers and set them up to run computational fluid dynamics, or CFD,
operations to simulate the performance of valves and other components.
The work kept Shotwell interested, but the environment started to grate on
her. There were rules for everything, including lots of union regulations
around who could operate certain machines. “I picked up a tool once, and
got written up,” she said. “Then I opened a bottle of liquid nitrogen and got
written up. I started thinking that the job was not what I had anticipated it
would be.”
Shotwell pulled out of the Chrysler training program, regrouped at
home, and then briefly pursued her doctorate in applied mathematics. While
back on the Northwestern campus, one of her professors mentioned an
opportunity at the Aerospace Corporation. Anything but a household name,
Aerospace Corporation has been headquartered in El Segundo since 1960,
serving as a kind of neutral, nonprofit organization that advises the air
force, NASA, and other federal bodies on space programs. The company
has a bureaucratic feel but has proved very useful over the years with its
research activities and ability to champion and nix costly endeavors.
Shotwell started at Aerospace in October 1988 and worked on a wide range
of projects. One job required her to develop a thermal model that depicted
how temperature fluctuations in the space shuttle’s cargo bay affected the
performance of equipment on various payloads. She spent ten years at
Aerospace and honed her skills as a systems engineer. By the end, though,
Shotwell had become irritated by the pace of the industry. “I didn’t
understand why it had to take fifteen years to make a military satellite,” she
said. “You could see my interest was waning.”
For the next four years, Shotwell worked at Microcosm, a space start-up
just down the road from the Aerospace Corporation, and became the head
of its space systems division and business development. Boasting a
combination of smarts, confidence, direct talk, and good looks, Shotwell
developed a reputation as a strong saleswoman. In 2002, one of her
coworkers, Hans Koenigsmann, left for SpaceX. Shotwell took
Koenigsmann out for a going-away lunch and dropped him off at SpaceX’s
then rinky-dink headquarters. “Hans told me to go in and meet Elon,”
Shotwell said. “I did, and that’s when I told him, ‘You need a good business
development person.’” The next day Mary Beth Brown called Shotwell and
told her that Musk wanted to interview her for the new vice president of
business development position. Shotwell ended up as employee No. 7. “I
gave three weeks’ notice at Microcosm and remodeled my bathroom
because I knew I would not have a life after taking the job,” she said.
Through the early years of SpaceX, Shotwell pulled off the miraculous
feat of selling something the company did not have. It took SpaceX so
much longer than it had planned to have a successful flight. The failures
along the way were embarrassing and bad for business. Nonetheless,
Shotwell managed to sell about a dozen flights to a mix of government and
commercial customers before SpaceX put its first Falcon 1 into orbit. Her
deal-making skills extended to negotiating the big-ticket contracts with
NASA that kept SpaceX alive during its leanest years, including a $278
million contract in August 2006 to begin work on vehicles that could ferry
supplies to the ISS. Shotwell’s track record of success turned her into
Musk’s ultimate confidante at SpaceX, and at the end of 2008, she became
president and chief operating officer at the company.
Part of Shotwell’s duties include reinforcing the SpaceX culture as the
company grows larger and larger and starts to resemble the traditional
aerospace giants that it likes to mock. Shotwell can switch on an easygoing,
affable air and address the entire company during a meeting or convince a
collection of possible recruits why they should sign up to be worked to the
bone. During one such meeting with a group of interns, Shotwell pulled
about a hundred people into the corner of the cafeteria. She wore high-heel
black boots, skintight jeans, a tan jacket, and a scarf and had big hoop
earnings dangling beside her shoulder-length blond hair. Pacing back and
forth in front of the group with a microphone in hand, she asked them to
announce what school they came from and what project they were working
on while at SpaceX. One student went to Cornell and worked on Dragon,
another went to USC and did propulsion system design, and another went to
the University of Illinois and worked with the aerodynamics group. It took
about thirty minutes to make it all the way around the room, and the
students were, at least by academic pedigree and bright-eyed enthusiasm,
among the most impressive youngsters in the world. The students peppered
Shotwell with questions—her best moment, her advice for being successful,
SpaceX’s competitive threats—and she replied with a mix of earnest
answers and rah-rah stuff. Shotwell made sure to emphasize the lean,
innovative edge SpaceX has over the more traditional aerospace companies.
“Our competitors are scared shitless of us,” Shotwell told the group. “The
behemoths are going to have to figure out how to get it together and
compete. And it is our job to have them die.”
One of SpaceX’s biggest goals, Shotwell said, was to fly as often as
possible. The company has never sought to make a fortune off each flight. It
would rather make a little on each launch and keep the flights flowing. A
Falcon 9 flight costs $60 million, and the company would like to see that
figure drop to about $20 million through economies of scale and
improvements in launch technology. SpaceX spent $2.5 billion to get four
Dragon capsules to the ISS, nine flights with the Falcon 9, and five flights
with the Falcon 1. It’s a price-per-launch total that the rest of the players in
the industry cannot comprehend let alone aspire to. “I don’t know what
those guys do with their money,” Shotwell said. “They are smoking it. I just
don’t know.” As Shotwell saw it, a number of new nations were showing
interest in launches, eyeing communications technology as essential to
growing their economies and leveling their status with developed nations.
Cheaper flights would help SpaceX take the majority of the business from
that new customer set. The company also expected to participate in an
expanding market for human flights. SpaceX has never had any interest in
doing the five-minute tourist flights to low Earth orbit like Virgin Galactic
and XCOR. It does, however, have the ability to carry researchers to
orbiting habitats being built by Bigelow Aerospace and to orbiting science
labs being constructed by various countries. SpaceX will also start making
its own satellites, turning the company into a one-stop space shop. All of
these plans hinge on SpaceX being able to prove that it can fly on schedule
every month and churn through the $5 billion backlog of launches. “Most of
our customers signed up early and wanted to be supportive and got good
deals on their missions,” she said. “We are in a phase now where we need to
launch on time and make launching Dragons more efficient.”
For a short while, the conversation with the interns bogged down. It
turned to some of the annoyances of SpaceX’s campus. The company leases
its facility and has not been able to build things like a massive parking
structure that would make life easier for its three-thousand-person
workforce. Shotwell promised that more parking, more bathrooms, and
more of the freebies that technology start-ups in Silicon Valley offer their
employees would be on the way. “I want a day care,” she said.
But it was while discussing SpaceX’s grandest missions that Shotwell
really came into her own and seemed to inspire the interns. Some of them
clearly dreamed of becoming astronauts, and Shotwell said that working at
SpaceX was almost certainly their best chance to get to space now that
NASA’s astronaut corps had dwindled. Musk had made designing coollooking,
“non–Stay Puft” spacesuits a personal priority. “They can’t be
clunky and nasty,” Shotwell said. “You have to do better than that.” As for
where the astronauts would go: well, there were the space habitats, the
moon, and, of course, Mars as options. SpaceX has already started testing a
giant rocket, called the Falcon Heavy, that will take it much farther into
space than the Falcon 9, and it has another, even larger spaceship on the
way. “Our Falcon Heavy rocket will not take a busload of people to Mars,”
she said. “So, there’s something after Heavy. We’re working on it.” To
make something like that vehicle happen, she said, the SpaceX employees
needed to be effective and pushy. “Make sure your output is high,” Shotwell
said. “If we’re throwing a bunch of shit in your way, you need to be mouthy
about it. That’s not a quality that’s widely accepted elsewhere, but it is at
SpaceX.” And, if that sounded harsh, so be it. As Shotwell saw it, the
commercial space race was coming down to SpaceX and China and that’s it.
And in the bigger picture, the race was on to ensure man’s survival. “If you
hate people and think human extinction is okay, then fuck it,” Shotwell said.
“Don’t go to space. If you think it is worth humans doing some risk
management and finding a second place to go live, then you should be
focused on this issue and willing to spend some money. I am pretty sure we
will be selected by NASA to drop landers and rovers off on Mars. Then the
first SpaceX mission will be to drop off a bunch of supplies, so that once
people get there, there will be places to live and food to eat and stuff for
them to do.”
It’s talk like this that thrills and amazes people in the aerospace industry,
who have long been hoping that some company would come along and truly
revolutionize space travel. Aeronautics experts will point out that twenty
years after the Wright brothers started their experiments, air travel had
become routine. The launch business, by contrast, appears to have frozen.
We’ve been to the moon, sent research vehicles to Mars, and explored the
solar system, but all of these things are still immensely expensive one-off
projects. “The cost remains extraordinarily high because of the rocket
equation,” said Carol Stoker, the planetary scientist at NASA. Thanks to
military and government contracts from agencies like NASA, the aerospace
industry has historically had massive budgets to work with and tried to
make the biggest, most reliable machines it could. The business has been
tuned to strive for maximum performance, so that the aerospace contractors
can say they met their requirements. That strategy makes sense if you’re
trying to send up a $1 billion military satellite for the U.S. government and
simply cannot afford for the payload to blow up. But on the whole, this
approach stifles the pursuit of other endeavors. It leads to bloat and excess
and a crippling of the commercial space industry.
Outside of SpaceX, the American launch providers are no longer
competitive against their peers in other countries. They have limited launch
abilities and questionable ambition. SpaceX’s main competitor for domestic
military satellites and other large payloads is United Launch Alliance
(ULA), a joint venture formed in 2006 when Boeing and Lockheed Martin
combined forces. The thinking at the time about the union was that the
government did not have enough business for two companies and that
combining the research and manufacturing work of Boeing and Lockheed
would result in cheaper, safer launches. ULA has leaned on decades of work
around the Delta (Boeing) and Atlas (Lockheed) launch vehicles and has
flown many dozens of rockets successfully, making it a model of reliability.
But neither the joint venture nor Boeing nor Lockheed, both of which can
offer commercial services on their own, come close to competing on price
against SpaceX, the Russians, or the Chinese. “For the most part, the global
commercial market is dominated by Arianespace [Europe], Long March
[China] or Russian vehicles,” said Dave Bearden, the general manager of
civil and commercial programs at the Aerospace Corporation. “There are
just different labor rates and differences in the way they are built.”
To put things more bluntly, ULA has turned into an embarrassment for
the United States. In March 2014, ULA’s then CEO, Michael Gass, faced
off against Musk during a congressional hearing that dealt, in part, with
SpaceX’s request to take on more of the government’s annual launch load.
A series of slides were rolled out that showed how the government
payments for launches have skyrocketed since Boeing and Lockheed went
from a duopoly to a monopoly. According to Musk’s math presented at the
hearing, ULA charged $380 million per flight, while SpaceX would charge
$90 million per flight. (The $90 million figure was higher than SpaceX’s
standard $60 million because the government has certain additional
requirements for particularly sensitive launches.) By simply picking
SpaceX as its launch provider, Musk pointed out, the government would
save enough money to pay for the satellite going on the rocket. Gass had no
real retort. He claimed Musk’s figures for the ULA launch price were
inaccurate but failed to provide a figure of his own. The hearing also came
as tensions between the United States and Russia were running high due to
Russia’s aggressive actions in Ukraine. Musk rightly noted that the United
States could soon be placing sanctions on Russia that could carry over to
aerospace equipment. ULA, as it happens, relies on Russian-made engines
to send up sensitive U.S. military equipment in its Atlas V rockets. “Our
Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles are truly American,” Musk
said. “We design and manufacture our rockets in California and Texas.”
Gass countered that ULA had bought a two-year supply of Russian engines
and purchased the blueprints to the machines and had them translated from
Russian to English, and he said this with a straight face. (A few months
after the hearing, ULA replaced Gass as CEO and signed a deal with Blue
Origin to develop American-made rockets.)
Some of the most disheartening moments of the hearing arrived when
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama took the microphone for questioning.
ULA has manufacturing facilities in Alabama and close ties to the senator.
Shelby felt compelled to play the role of hometown booster by repeatedly
pointing out that ULA had enjoyed sixty-eight successful launches and then
asking Musk what he made of that accomplishment. The aerospace industry
stands as one of Shelby’s biggest donors and he’s ended up surprisingly probureaucracy
and anticompetition when it comes to getting things into space.
“Typically competition results in better quality and lower-priced contracts
—but the launch market is not typical,” Shelby said. “It is limited demand
framed by government-industrial policies.” The March hearing in which
Shelby made these statements would turn out to be something of a sham.
The government had agreed to put fourteen of its sensitive launches up for
bid instead of just awarding them directly to ULA. Musk had come to
Congress to present his case for why SpaceX made sense as a viable
candidate for those and other launches. The day after the hearing, the air
force cut the number of launches up for bid from fourteen to between seven
and one. One month later, SpaceX filed a lawsuit against the air force
asking for a chance to earn its launch business. “SpaceX is not seeking to be
awarded contracts for these launches,” the company said on its
freedomtolaunch.com website. “We are simply seeking the right to
compete.”*
SpaceX’s main competitor for ISS resupply missions and commercial
satellites in the United States is Orbital Sciences Corporation. Founded in
Virginia in 1982, the company started out not unlike SpaceX, as the new kid
that raised outside funding and focused on putting smaller satellites into
low-Earth orbit. Orbital is more experienced, although it has a limited roster
of machine types. Orbital depends on suppliers, including Russian and
Ukrainian companies, for its engines and rocket bodies, making it more of
an assembler of spacecraft than a true builder like SpaceX. And, also unlike
SpaceX, Orbital’s capsules cannot withstand the journey back from the ISS
to Earth, so it’s unable to return experiments and other goods. In October
2014, one of Orbital’s rockets blew up on the launchpad. With its ability to
launch on hold while it investigated the incident, Orbital reached out to
SpaceX for help. It wanted to see if Musk had any extra capacity to take
care of some of Orbital’s customers. The company also signaled that it
would move away from using Russian engines as well.
As for getting humans to space, SpaceX and Boeing were the victors in
a four-year NASA competition to fly astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX will get
$2.6 billion, and Boeing will get $4.2 billion to develop their capsules and
ferry people to the ISS by 2017. The companies would, in effect, be
replacing the space shuttle and restoring the United States’ ability to
conduct manned flights. “I actually don’t mind that Boeing gets twice as
much money for meeting the same NASA requirements as SpaceX with
worse technology,” Musk said. “Having two companies involved is better
for the advancement of human spaceflight.”
SpaceX had once looked like it too would be a one-trick pony. The
company’s original plans were to have the smallish Falcon 1 function as its
primary workhorse. At $6 million to $12 million per flight, the Falcon 1
was by far the cheapest means of getting something into orbit, thrilling
people in the space industry. When Google announced its Lunar X Prize in
2007—$30 million in awards to people who could land a robot on the moon
—many of the proposals that followed selected the Falcon 1 as their
preferred launch vehicle because it seemed like the only reasonably priced
option for getting something to the moon. Scientists around the world were
equally excited, thinking that for the first time they had a means of placing
experiments into orbit in a cost-effective way. But for all the enthusiastic
talk about the Falcon 1, the demand never arrived. “It became very clear
that there was a huge need for the Falcon 1 but no money for it,” said
Shotwell. “The market has to be able to sustain a certain amount of
vehicles, and three Falcon 1s per year does not make a business.” The last
Falcon 1 launch took place in July 2009 from Kwajalein, when SpaceX
carried a satellite into orbit for the Malaysian government. People in the
aerospace industry have been grumbling ever since. “We gave Falcon 1 a
hell of a shot,” Shotwell said. “I was emotional about it and disappointed.
I’d anticipated a flood of orders but, after eight years, they just did not
come.”
SpaceX has since expanded its launch capabilities at a remarkable pace
and looks like it might be on the verge of getting that $12 million per flight
option back. In June 2010, the Falcon 9 flew for the first time and orbited
Earth successfully. In December 2010, SpaceX proved that the Falcon 9
could carry the Dragon capsule into space and that the capsule could be
recovered safely after an ocean landing.* It became the first commercial
company ever to pull off this feat. Then, in May 2012, SpaceX went
through the most significant moment in the company’s history since that
first successful launch on Kwajalein.
On May 22, at 3:44 A.M., a Falcon 9 rocket took off from the Kennedy
Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket did its yeoman-like
work boosting Dragon into space. Then the capsule’s solar panels fanned
out and Dragon became dependent on its eighteen Draco thrusters, or small
rocket engines, to guide its path to the International Space Station. The
SpaceX engineers worked in shifts—some of them sleeping on cots at the
factory—as it took the capsule three days for Dragon to make its journey.
They spent most of the time observing Dragon’s flight and checking to see
that its sensor systems were picking up the ISS. Originally, Dragon planned
to dock with the ISS around 4 A.M. on the twenty-fifth, but as the capsule
approached the space station, an unexpected glint kept throwing off the
calculations of a laser used to measure the distance between Dragon and the
ISS. “I remember it being two and a half hours of struggle,” Shotwell said.
Her outfit of Uggs, a fishnet sweater, and leggings started to feel like
pajamas as the night wore on, and the engineers battled this unplanned
difficulty. Fearing all the time that the mission would be aborted, SpaceX
decided to upload some new software to the Dragon that would cut the size
of the visual frame used by the sensors to eliminate the effect of the sunlight
on the machine. Then, just before 7 A.M., Dragon got close enough to the
ISS for Don Pettit, an astronaut, to use a fifty-eight-foot robotic arm to
reach out and grab the resupply capsule. “Houston, Station, it looks like
we’ve got us a dragon by the tail,” Pettit said.13
“I’d been digesting my guts,” Shotwell said. “And then I am drinking
champagne at six in the morning.” About thirty people were in the control
room when the docking happened. Over the next couple of hours, workers
streamed into the SpaceX factory to soak up the elation of the moment.
SpaceX had set another first, as the only private company to dock with the
ISS. A couple of months later SpaceX received $440 million from NASA to
keep developing Dragon so that it could transport people. “Elon is changing
the way aerospace business is done,” said NASA’s Stoker. “He’s managed
to keep the safety factor up while cutting costs. He’s just taken the best
things from the tech industry like the open-floor office plans and having
everyone talking and all this human interaction. It’s a very different way to
most of the aerospace industry, which is designed to produce requirements
documents and project reviews.”
In May 2014, Musk invited the press to SpaceX’s headquarters to
demonstrate what some of that NASA money had bought. He unveiled the
Dragon V2, or version two, spacecraft. Unlike most executives, who like to
show their products off at trade shows or daytime events, Musk prefers to
hold true Hollywood-style galas in the evenings. People arrived in
Hawthorne by the hundreds and snacked on hors d’oeuvres until the 7:30
P.M. showing. Musk appeared wearing a purplish velvet jacket and popping
open the capsule’s door with a bump of his fist like the Fonz. What he
revealed was spectacular. The cramped quarters of past capsules were gone.
There were seven thin, sturdy, contoured seats arranged with four seats
close to the main console and a row of three seats in the back. Musk walked
around in the capsule to show how roomy it was and then plopped down in
the central captain’s chair. He reached up and unlocked a four-paneled flatscreen
console that gracefully slid down right in front of the first row of
seats.* In the middle of the console was a joystick for flying the aircraft and
some physical buttons for essential functions that astronauts could press in
case of an emergency or a malfunctioning touch-screen. The inside of the
capsule had a bright, metallic finish. Someone had finally built a spaceship
worthy of scientist and moviemaker dreams.
There was substance to go with the style. The Dragon 2 will be able to
dock with the ISS and other space habitats automatically without needing
the intervention of a robotic arm. It will run on a SuperDraco engine—a
thruster made by SpaceX and the first engine ever built completely by a 3-D
printer to go into space. This means that a machine guided by a computer
formed the engine out of single piece of metal—in this case the highstrength
alloy Inconel—so that its strength and performance should exceed
anything built by humans by welding various parts together. And most
mind-boggling of all, Musk revealed that the Dragon 2 will be able to land
anywhere on Earth that SpaceX wants by using the SuperDraco engines and
thrusters to come to a gentle stop on the ground. No more landings at sea.
No more throwing spaceships away. “That is how a twenty-first-century
spaceship should land,” Musk said. “You can just reload propellant and fly
again. So long as we continue to throw away rockets and spacecraft, we will
never have true access to space.”
The Dragon 2 is just one of the machines that SpaceX continues to
develop in parallel. One of the company’s next milestones will be the first
flight of the Falcon Heavy, which is designed to be the world’s most
powerful rocket.* SpaceX has found a way to combine three Falcon 9s into
a single craft with 27 of the Merlin engines and the ability to carry more
than 53 metric tons of stuff into orbit. Part of the genius of Musk and
Mueller’s designs is that SpaceX can reuse the same engine in different
configurations—from the Falcon 1 up to the Falcon Heavy—saving on cost
and time. “We make our main combustion chambers, turbo pump, gas
generators, injectors, and main valves,” Mueller said. “We have complete
control. We have our own test site, while most of the other guys use
government test sites. The labor hours are cut in half and so is the work
around the materials. Four years ago, we could make two rockets a year and
now we can make twenty a year.” SpaceX boasts that the Falcon Heavy can
take up twice the payload of the nearest competitor—the Delta IV Heavy
from Boeing/ULA—at one-third the cost. SpaceX is also busy building a
spaceport from the ground up. The goal is to be able to launch many rockets
an hour from this facility located in Brownsville, Texas, by automating the
processes needed to stand a rocket up on the pad, fuel it, and send it off.
Just as it did in the early days, SpaceX continues to experiment with
these new vehicles during actual launches in ways that other companies
would dare not do. SpaceX will often announce that it’s trying out a new
engine or its landing legs and place the emphasis on that one upgrade in the
marketing material leading up to a launch. It’s common, though, for SpaceX
to test out a dozen other objectives in secret during a mission. Musk
essentially asks employees to do the impossible on top of the impossible.
One former SpaceX executive described the working atmosphere as a
perpetual-motion machine that runs on a weird mix of dissatisfaction and
eternal hope. “It’s like he has everyone working on this car that is meant to
get from Los Angeles to New York on one tank of gas,” this executive said.
“They will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts. Then, when
they set off for New York after that year, all of the vice presidents think
privately that the car will be lucky to get to Las Vegas. What ends up
happening is that the car gets to New Mexico—twice as far as they ever
expected—and Elon is still mad. He gets twice as much as anyone else out
of people.”
There’s a degree to which it’s just never enough for Musk, no matter
what it is. Case in point: the December 2010 launch in which SpaceX got
the Dragon capsule to orbit Earth and return successfully. This had been one
of the company’s great achievements, and people had worked tirelessly for
months, if not years. The launch had taken place on December 8, and
SpaceX had a Christmas party on December 16. About ninety minutes
before the party started, Musk had called his top executives to SpaceX for a
meeting. Six of them, including Mueller, were decked out in party attire and
ready to celebrate the holidays and SpaceX’s historic achievement around
Dragon. Musk laid into them for about an hour because the truss structure
for a future rocket was running behind schedule. “Their wives were sitting
three cubes over waiting for the berating to end,” Brogan said. Other
examples of similar behavior have cropped up from time to time. Musk, for
example, rewarded a group of thirty employees who had pulled off a tough
project for NASA with bonuses that consisted of additional stock option
grants. Many of the employees, seeking instant, more tangible gratification,
demanded cash. “He chided us for not valuing the stock,” Drew Eldeen, a
former engineer, said. “He said, ‘In the long run, this is worth a lot more
than a thousand dollars in cash.’ He wasn’t screaming or anything like that,
but he seemed disappointed in us. It was hard to hear that.”
The lingering question for many SpaceX employees is when exactly
they will see a big reward for all their work. SpaceX’s staff is paid well but
by no means exorbitantly. Many of them expect to make their money when
SpaceX files for an initial public offering. The thing is that Musk does not
want to go public anytime soon, and understandably so. It’s a bit hard to
explain the whole Mars thing to investors, when it’s unclear what the
business model around starting a colony on another planet will be. When
the employees heard Musk say that an IPO was years away and would not
occur until the Mars mission looked more secure, they started to grumble,
and when Musk found out, he addressed all of SpaceX in an e-mail that is a
fantastic window into his thinking and how it differs from almost every
other CEO’s. (The full e-mail appears in Appendix 3.)

Going Public
Per my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about
SpaceX going public before the Mars transport system is in place.
Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and
always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public
company diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until
Mars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering,
but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to
foist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature
of our mission.
Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company
experience may think that being public is desirable. This is not so.
Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in
technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for
reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do
with anything except the economy. This causes people to be
distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of
creating great products.
For those who are under the impression that they are so clever
that they can outsmart public market investors and would sell
SpaceX stock at the “right time,” let me relieve you of any such
notion. If you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then
there is no need to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as
you can just invest in other public company stocks and make
billions of dollars in the market.

THE REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR
THERE ARE SO MANY TELEVISION COMMERCIALS FOR CARS
AND TRUCKS that it’s easy to become immune to them and ignore what’s
taking place in the ads. That’s okay. Because there’s not really much of note
happening. Carmakers looking to put a modicum of effort into their ads
have been hawking the exact same things for decades: a car with a bit more
room, a few extra miles per gallon, better handling, or an extra cup holder.
Those that can’t find anything interesting at all to tout about their cars turn
to scantily clad women, men with British accents, and, when necessary,
dancing mice in tuxedos to try and convince people that their products are
better than the rest. Next time a car ad appears on your television, pause for
a moment and really listen to what’s being said. When you realize that the
Volkswagen sign-and-drive “event” is code for “we’re making the
experience of buying a car slightly less miserable than usual,” you’ll start to
appreciate just how low the automotive industry has sunk.
In the middle of 2012, Tesla Motors stunned its complacent peers in the
automotive industry. It began shipping the Model S sedan. This all-electric
luxury vehicle could go more than 300 miles on a single charge. It could
reach 60 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds. It could seat seven people, if you
used a couple of optional rear-facing seats in the back for kids. It also had
two trunks. There was the standard one and then what Tesla calls a “frunk”
up front, where the bulky engine would usually be. The Model S ran on an
electric battery pack that makes up the base of the car and a watermelonsized
electric motor located between the rear tires. Getting rid of the engine
and its din of clanging machinery also meant that the Model S ran silently.
The Model S outclassed most other luxury sedans in terms of raw speed,
mileage, handling, and storage space.
And there was more—like a cutesy thing with the door handles, which
were flush with the car’s body until the driver got close to the Model S.
Then the silver handles would pop out, the driver would open the door and
get in, and the handles would retract flush with the car’s body again. Once
inside, the driver encountered a seventeen-inch touch-screen that controlled
the vast majority of the car’s functions, be it raising the volume on the
stereo* or opening the sunroof with a slide of the finger. Whereas most cars
have a large dashboard to accommodate various displays and buttons and to
protect people from the noise of the engine, the Model S offered up vast
amounts of space. The Model S had an ever-present Internet connection,
allowing the driver to stream music through the touch console and to
display massive Google maps for navigation. The driver didn’t need to turn
a key or even push an ignition button to start the car. His weight in the seat
coupled with a sensor in the key fob, which is shaped like a tiny Model S,
was enough to activate the vehicle. Made of lightweight aluminum, the car
achieved the highest safety rating in history. And it could be recharged for
free at Tesla’s stations lining highways across the United States and later
around the world.
For both engineers and green-minded people, the Model S presented a
model of efficiency. Traditional cars and hybrids have anywhere from
hundreds to thousands of moving parts. The engine must perform constant,
controlled explosions with pistons, crankshafts, oil filters, alternators, fans,
distributors, valves, coils, and cylinders among the many pieces of
machinery needed for the work. The oomph produced by the engine must
then be passed through clutches, gears, and driveshafts to make the wheels
turn, and then exhaust systems have to deal with the waste. Cars end up
being about 10–20 percent efficient at turning the input of gasoline into the
output of propulsion. Most of the energy (about 70 percent) is lost as heat in
the engine, while the rest is lost through wind resistance, braking, and other
mechanical functions. The Model S, by contrast, has about a dozen moving
parts, with the battery pack sending energy instantly to a watermelon-sized
motor that turns the wheels. The Model S ends up being about 60 percent
efficient, losing most of the rest of its energy to heat. The sedan gets the
equivalent of about 100 miles per gallon.*
Yet another distinguishing characteristic of the Model S was the
experience of buying and owning the car. You didn’t go to a dealership and
haggle with a pushy salesman. Tesla sold the Model S directly through its
own stores and website. Typically, the stores were placed in high-end malls
or affluent suburbs, not far from the Apple stores on which they were
modeled. Customers would walk in and find a complete Model S in the
middle of the shop and often an exposed version of the car’s base near the
back of the store to show off the battery pack and motor. There were
massive touch-screens where people could calculate how much they might
save on fuel costs by moving to an all-electric car, and where they could
configure the look and add-ons for their future Model S. Once the
configuration process was done, the customer could give the screen a big,
forceful swipe and his Model S would theatrically appear on an even bigger
screen in the center of the store. If you wanted to sit in the display model, a
salesman would pull back a red velvet rope near the driver’s-side door and
let you enter the car. The salespeople were not compensated on commission
and didn’t have to try to talk you into buying a suite of extras. Whether you
ultimately bought the car in the store or online, it was delivered in a
concierge fashion. Tesla would bring it to your home, office, or anywhere
else you wanted it. The company also offered customers the option of
picking their cars up from the factory in Silicon Valley and treating their
friends and family to a complimentary tour of the facility. In the months that
followed the delivery, there were no oil changes or tune-ups to be dealt with
because the Model S didn’t need them. It had done away with so much of
the mechanical dreck standard in an internal combustion vehicle. However,
if something did go wrong with the car, Tesla would come pick it up and
give the customer a loaner while it repaired the Model S.
The Model S also offered a way to fix issues in a manner that people
had never before encountered with a mass-produced car. Some of the early
owners complained about glitches like the door handles not popping out
quite right or their windshield wipers operating at funky speeds. These were
inexcusable flaws for such a costly vehicle, but Tesla typically moved with
clever efficiency to address them. While the owner slept, Tesla’s engineers
tapped into the car via the Internet connection and downloaded software
updates. When the customer took the car out for a spin in the morning and
found it working right, he was left feeling as if magical elves had done the
work. Tesla soon began showing off its software skills for jobs other than
making up for mistakes. It put out a smartphone app that let people turn on
their air-conditioning or heating from afar and to see where the car was
parked on a map. Tesla also began installing software updates that imbued
the Model S with new features. Overnight, the Model S sometimes got new
traction controls for hilly and highway driving or could suddenly recharge
much faster than before or possess a new range of voice controls. Tesla had
transformed the car into a gadget—a device that actually got better after you
bought it. As Craig Venter, one of the earliest Model S owners and the
famed scientist who first decoded man’s DNA, put it, “It changes
everything about transportation. It’s a computer on wheels.”
The first people to notice what Tesla had accomplished were the
technophiles in Silicon Valley. The region is filled with early adopters
willing to buy the latest gizmos and suffer through their bugs. Normally this
habit applies to computing devices ranging from $100 to $2,000 in price.
This time around, the early adopters proved willing not only to spend
$100,000 on a product that might not work but also to trust their well-being
to a start-up. Tesla needed this early boost of confidence and got it on a
scale few expected. In the first couple of months after the Model S went on
sale, you might see one or two per day on the streets of San Francisco and
the surrounding cities. Then you started to see five to ten per day. Soon
enough, the Model S seemed to feel like the most common car in Palo Alto
and Mountain View, the two cities at the heart of Silicon Valley. The Model
S emerged as the ultimate status symbol for wealthy technophiles, allowing
them to show off, get a new gadget, and claim to be helping the
environment at the same time. From Silicon Valley, the Model S
phenomenon spread to Los Angeles, then all along the West Coast and then
to Washington, D.C., and New York (although to a lesser degree).
At first the more traditional automakers viewed the Model S as a
gimmick and its surging sales as part of a fad. These sentiments, however,
soon gave way to something more akin to panic. In November 2012, just a
few months after it started shipping, the Model S was named Motor Trend’s
Car of the Year in the first unanimous vote that anyone at the magazine
could remember. The Model S beat out eleven other vehicles from
companies such as Porsche, BMW, Lexus, and Subaru and was heralded as
“proof positive that America can still make great things.” Motor Trend
celebrated the Model S as the first non–internal combustion engine car ever
to win its top award and wrote that the vehicle handled like a sports car,
drove as smoothly as a Rolls-Royce, held as much as a Chevy Equinox, and
was more efficient than a Toyota Prius. Several months later, Consumer
Reports gave the Model S its highest car rating in history—99 out of 100—
while proclaiming that it was likely the best car ever built. It was at about
this time that sales of the Model S started to soar alongside Tesla’s share
price and that General Motors, among other automakers, pulled together a
team to study the Model S, Tesla, and the methods of Elon Musk.
It’s worth pausing for a moment to meditate on what Tesla had
accomplished. Musk had set out to make an electric car that did not suffer
from any compromises. He did that. Then, using a form of entrepreneurial
judo, he upended the decades of criticisms against electric cars. The Model
S was not just the best electric car; it was best car, period, and the car
people desired. America had not seen a successful car company since
Chrysler emerged in 1925. Silicon Valley had done little of note in the
automotive industry. Musk had never run a car factory before and was
considered arrogant and amateurish by Detroit. Yet, one year after the
Model S went on sale, Tesla had posted a profit, hit $562 million in
quarterly revenue, raised its sales forecast, and become as valuable as
Mazda Motor. Elon Musk had built the automotive equivalent of the
iPhone. And car executives in Detroit, Japan, and Germany had only their
crappy ads to watch as they pondered how such a thing had occurred.
You can forgive the automotive industry veterans for being caught
unawares. For years Tesla had looked like an utter disaster incapable of
doing much of anything right. It took until early 2009 for Tesla to really hit
its stride with the Roadster and work out the manufacturing issues behind
the sports car. Just as the company tried to build some momentum around
the Roadster, Musk sent out an e-mail to customers declaring a price hike.
Where the car originally started around $92,000, it would now start at
$109,000. In the e-mail, Musk said that four hundred customers who had
already placed their orders for a Roadster but not yet received them would
bear the brunt of the price change and need to cough up the extra cash. He
tried to assuage Tesla’s customer base by arguing that the company had no
choice but to raise prices. The manufacturing costs for the Roadster had
come in much higher than the company initially expected, and Tesla needed
to prove that it could make the cars at a profit to bolster its chances of
securing a large government loan that would be needed to build the Model
S, which it vowed to deliver in 2011. “I firmly believe that the plan . . .
strikes a reasonable compromise between being fair to early customers and
ensuring the viability of Tesla, which is obviously in the best interests of all
customers,” Musk wrote in the e-mail. “Mass market electric cars have been
my goal from the beginning of Tesla. I don’t want and I don’t think the vast
majority of Tesla customers want us to do anything to jeopardize that
objective.” While some Tesla customers grumbled, Musk had largely read
his customer base right. They would support just about anything he
suggested.
Following the price increase, Tesla had a safety recall. It said that Lotus,
the manufacturer of the Roadster’s chassis, had failed to tighten a bolt
properly on its assembly line. On the plus side, Tesla had only delivered
about 345 Roadsters, which meant that it could fix the problem in a
manageable fashion. On the downside, a safety recall was the last thing a
car start-up needs, even if it was, as Tesla claimed, more of a proactive
measure than anything else. The next year, Tesla had another voluntary
recall. It had received a report of a power cable grinding against the body of
the Roadster to the point that it caused a short circuit and some smoke. That
time, Tesla brought 439 Roadsters in for a fix. Tesla did its best to put a
positive spin on these issues, saying that it would make “house calls” to fix
the Roadsters or pick up the cars and take them back to the factory. Ever
since, Musk has tried to turn any snafu with a Tesla into an excuse to show
off the company’s attention to service and dedication to pleasing the
customer. More often than not, the strategy has worked.
On top of the occasional issues with the Roadster, Tesla continued to
suffer from public perception problems. In June 2009, Martin Eberhard
sued Musk and went to town in the complaint detailing his ouster from the
company. Eberhard accused Musk of libel, slander, and breach of contract.
The charges painted Musk as a bully moneyman who had pushed the
soulful inventor out of his own company. The lawsuit also accused Musk of
trumping up his role in Tesla’s founding. Musk responded in kind, issuing a
blog post that detailed his take on Eberhard’s foibles and taking umbrage at
the suggestions that he was not a true founder of the company. A short
while later, the two men settled and agreed to stop going at each other. “As
co-founder of the company, Elon’s contributions to Tesla have been
extraordinary,” Eberhard said in a statement at the time. It must have been
excruciating for Eberhard to agree to put that in writing and the very
existence of that statement points to Musk’s skills and tactics as a hard-line
negotiator. The two men continue to despise each other today, although they
must do so in private, as legally required. Eberhard, though, holds no longstanding
grudge against Tesla. His shares in the company ended up
becoming very valuable. He still drives his Roadster, and his wife got a
Model S.
For so much of its early existence, Tesla appeared in the news for the
wrong reasons. There were people in the media and the automotive industry
who viewed it as a gimmick. They seemed to delight in the soap opera–
worthy spats between Musk and Eberhard and other disgruntled former
employees. Far from being seen universally as a successful entrepreneur,
Musk was viewed in some Silicon Valley circles as an abrasive blowhard
who would get what he deserved when Tesla inevitably collapsed. The
Roadster would make its way to the electric-car graveyard. Detroit would
prove that it had a better handle on this whole car innovation thing than
Silicon Valley. The natural order of the world would remain intact.
A funny thing happened, however. Tesla did just enough to survive.
From 2008 to 2012, Tesla sold about 2,500 Roadsters.* The car had
accomplished what Musk had intended from the outset. It proved that
electric cars could be fun to drive and that they could be objects of desire.
With the Roadster, Tesla kept electric cars in the public’s consciousness and
did so under impossible circumstances, namely the collapse of the
American automotive industry and the global financial markets. Whether
Musk was a founder of Tesla in the purest sense of the word is irrelevant at
this point. There would be no Tesla to talk about today were it not for
Musk’s money, marketing savvy, chicanery, engineering smarts, and
indomitable spirit. Tesla was, in effect, willed into existence by Musk and
reflects his personality as much as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple reflect the
personalities of their founders. Marc Tarpenning, the other Tesla cofounder,
said as much when he reflected on what Musk has meant to the company.
“Elon pushed Tesla so much farther than we ever imagined,” he said.
As difficult as birthing the Roadster had been, the adventure had
whetted Musk’s appetite for what he could accomplish in the automotive
industry with a clean slate. Tesla’s next car—code-named WhiteStar—
would not be an adapted version of another company’s vehicle. It would be
made from scratch and structured to take full advantage of what the electriccar
technology offered. The battery pack in the Roadster, for example, had
to be placed near the rear of the car because of constraints imposed by the
Lotus Elise chassis. This was okay but not ideal due to the imposing weight
of the batteries. With WhiteStar, which would become the Model S, Musk
and Tesla’s engineers knew from the start that they would place the 1,300-
pound battery pack on the base of the car. This would give the vehicle a low
center of gravity and excellent handling. It would also give the Model S
what’s known as a low polar moment of inertia, which relates to how a car
resists turning. Ideally, you want heavy parts like the engine as close as
possible to the car’s center of gravity, which is why the engines of race cars
tend to be near the middle of the vehicle. Traditional cars are a mess on this
metric, with the bulky engine up front, passengers in the middle, and
gasoline sloshing around the rear. In the case of the Model S, the bulk of the
car’s mass is very close to the center of gravity and this has positive followon
effects to handling, performance, and safety.
The innards, though, were just one part of what would make the Model
S shine. Musk wanted to make a statement with the car’s look as well. It
would be a sedan, yes, but it would be a sexy sedan. It would also be
comfortable and luxurious and have none of the compromises that Tesla had
been forced to embrace with the Roadster. To bring such a beautiful,
functional car to life, Musk hired Henrik Fisker, a Danish automobile
designer renowned for his work at Aston Martin.
Tesla first revealed its plans for the Model S to Fisker in 2007. It asked
him to design a sleek, four-door sedan that would cost between $50,000 and
$70,000. Tesla could still barely make Roadsters and had no idea if its allelectric
powertrain would hold up over time. Musk, though, refused to wait
and find out. He wanted the Model S to ship in late 2009 or early 2010 and
needed Fisker to work fast. By reputation, Fisker had a flair for the dramatic
and had produced some of the most stunning car designs over the past
decade, not just for Aston Martin but also for special versions of BMW and
Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
Fisker had a studio in Orange County, California, and Musk and other
Tesla executives would meet there to go over his evolving takes on the
Model S. Each visit was less inspiring than the last. Fisker baffled the Tesla
teams with his stodgy designs. “Some of the early styles were like a giant
egg,” said Ron Lloyd, the former vice president of the WhiteStar project at
Tesla. “They were terrible.” When Musk pushed back, Fisker blamed the
physical constraints Tesla had put in place for the Model S as too restrictive.
“He said they would not let him make the car sexy,” Lloyd said. Fisker tried
a couple of different approaches and unveiled some foam models of the car
for Musk and his crew to dissect. “We kept on telling him they were not
right,” Lloyd said.
Not long after these meetings, Fisker started his own company—Fisker
Automotive—and unveiled the Fisker Karma hybrid in 2008. This luxury
sedan looked like a vehicle Batman might take out for a Sunday drive. With
its elongated lines and sharp edges, the car was stunning and truly original.
“It rapidly became clear that he was trying to compete with us,” Lloyd said.
As Musk dug into the situation, he discovered that Fisker had been
shopping his idea for a car company to investors around Silicon Valley for
some time. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of the more famous
venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, once had a chance to invest in Tesla
and then ended up putting money into Fisker instead. All of this was too
much for Musk, and he launched a lawsuit against Fisker in 2008, accusing
him of stealing Tesla’s ideas and using the $875,000 Tesla had paid for
design work to help get his rival car company off the ground. (Fisker
ultimately prevailed in the dispute with an arbitrator ordering Tesla to
reimburse Fisker’s legal fees and deeming Tesla’s allegations baseless.)
Tesla had thought about doing a hybrid like Fisker where a gas engine
would be present to recharge the car’s batteries after they had consumed an
initial charge. The car would be able to travel fifty to eighty miles after
being plugged into an outlet and then take advantage of ubiquitous gas
stations as needed to top up the batteries, eliminating range anxiety. Tesla’s
engineers prototyped the hybrid vehicle and ran all sorts of cost and
performance metrics. In the end, they found the hybrid to be too much of a
compromise. “It would be expensive, and the performance would not be as
good as the all-electric car,” said J. B. Straubel. “And we would have
needed to build a team to compete with the core competency of every car
company in the world. We would have been betting against all the things we
believe in, like the power electronics and batteries improving. We decided
to put all the effort into going where we think the endpoint is and to never
look back.” After coming to this conclusion, Straubel and others inside
Tesla started to let go of their anger toward Fisker. They figured he would
end up delivering a kluge of a car and get what was coming to him.
A large car company might spend $1 billion and need thousands of
people to design a new vehicle and bring it to market. Tesla had nothing
close to these resources as it gave birth to the Model S. According to Lloyd,
Tesla initially aimed to make about ten thousand Model S sedans per year
and had budgeted around $130 million to achieve this goal, including
engineering the car and acquiring the manufacturing machines needed to
stamp out the body parts. “One of the things Elon pushed hard with
everyone was to do as much as possible in-house,” Lloyd said. Tesla would
make up for its lack of R&D money by hiring smart people who could
outwork and outthink the third parties relied on by the rest of the
automakers. “The mantra was that one great engineer will replace three
medium ones,” Lloyd said.
A small team of Tesla engineers began the process of trying to figure
out the mechanical inner workings of the Model S. Their first step in this
journey took place at a Mercedes dealership where they test drove a CLS 4-
Door Coupe and an E-Class sedan. The cars had the same chassis, and the
Tesla engineers took measurements of every inch of the vehicles, studying
what they liked and didn’t like. In the end, they preferred the styling on the
CLS and settled on it as their baseline for thinking about the Model S.
After purchasing a CLS, Tesla’s engineers tore it apart. One team had
reshaped the boxy, rectangular battery pack from the Roadster and made it
flat. The engineers cut the floor out of the CLS and plopped in the pack.
Next they put the electronics that tied the whole system together in the
trunk. After that, they replaced the interior of the car to restore its fit and
finish. Following three months of work, Tesla had in effect built an allelectric
Mercedes CLS. Tesla used the car to woo investors and future
partners like Daimler that would eventually turn to Tesla for electric
powertrains in their vehicles. Now and again, the Tesla team took the car
out for drives on public roads. It weighed more than the Roadster but was
still fast and had a range of about 120 miles per charge. To perform these
joyrides-cum-tests in relative secrecy, the engineers had to weld the tips of
the exhaust pipes back onto the car to make it look like any other CLS.
It was at this time, the summer of 2008, when an artsy car lover named
Franz von Holzhausen joined Tesla. His job would be to breathe new life
into the car’s early designs and, if possible, turn the Model S into an iconic
product.*
Von Holzhausen grew up in a small Connecticut town. His father
worked on the design and marketing of consumer products, and Franz
treated the family basement full of markers, different kinds of paper, and
other materials as a playground for his imagination. As he grew older, von
Holzhausen drifted toward cars. He and a friend stripped down a dunebuggy
motor one winter and then built it back up, and von Holzhausen
always filled the margins of his school notebooks with drawings of cars and
had pictures of cars on his bedroom walls. Applying to college, von
Holzhausen decided to follow his father’s path and enrolled in the industrial
design program at Syracuse University. Then, through a chance encounter
with another designer during an internship, von Holzhausen heard about the
Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. “This guy had been teaching
me about car design and this school in Los Angeles, and I got superintrigued,”
said von Holzhausen. “I went to Syracuse for two years and then
decided to transfer out to California.”
The move to Los Angeles kicked off a long and storied design career in
the automotive industry. Von Holzhausen would go on to intern in Michigan
with Ford and in Europe with Volkswagen, where he began to pick up on a
mix of design sensibilities. After graduating in 1992, he started work for
Volkswagen on just about the most exciting project imaginable—a topsecret
new version of the Beetle. “It really was a magical time,” von
Holzhausen said. “Only fifty people in the world knew we were doing this
project.” Von Holzhausen had a chance to work on the exterior and interior
of the vehicle, including the signature flower vase built into the dashboard.
In 1997, Volkswagen launched the “New Beetle,” and von Holzhausen saw
firsthand how the look of the car captivated the public and changed the way
people felt about Volkswagen, which had suffered from woeful sales in the
United States. “It started a rebirth of the VW brand and brought design back
into their mix,” he said.
Von Holzhausen spent eight years with VW, climbing the ranks of its
design team and falling in love with the car culture of Southern California.
Los Angeles has long adored its cars, with the climate lending itself to all
manner of vehicles from convertibles to surfboard-toting vans. Almost all
of the major carmakers set up design studios in the city. The presence of the
studios allowed von Holzhausen to hop from VW to General Motors and
Mazda, where he served as the company’s director of design.
GM taught von Holzhausen just how nasty a big car company could
become. None of the cars in GM’s lineup really excited him, and it seemed
near impossible to make a large impact on the company’s culture. He was
one member of a thousand-person design team that divvyed up the makes of
cars haphazardly without any consideration as to which person really
wanted to work on which car. “They took all the spirit out of me,” said von
Holzhausen. “I knew I didn’t want to die there.” Mazda, by contrast, needed
and wanted help. It let von Holzhausen and his team in Los Angeles put
their imprint on every car in the North American vehicle lineup and to
produce a set of concept cars that reshaped how the company approached
design. As von Holzhausen put it, “We brought the zoom-zoom back into
the look and feel of the car.”
Von Holzhausen started a project to make Mazda’s cars more green by
revaluating the types of materials used to fabricate the seats and the fuels
going into the vehicles. He had, in fact, just made an ethanol-based concept
car when, in early 2008, a friend told him that Tesla needed a chief designer.
After playing phone tag for a month with Musk’s assistant, Mary Beth
Brown, to inquire about the position, von Holzhausen finally got in touch
and met Musk for an interview at the SpaceX headquarters.
Musk instantly saw von Holzhausen, with his bouffant, trendy clothes
and laid-back attitude, as a free-spirited, creative complement and wooed
him with vigor. They took a tour of the SpaceX factory in Hawthorne and
Tesla’s headquarters in Silicon Valley. Both facilities were chaotic and
reeked of start-up. Musk ramped up the charm and sold von Holzhausen on
the idea that he had a chance to shape the future of the automobile and that
it made sense to leave his cushy job at a big, proven automaker for this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “Elon and I went for a drive in the Roadster,
and everyone was checking it out,” von Holzhausen said. “I knew I could
stay at Mazda for ten years and get very comfortable or take a huge leap of
faith. At Tesla, there was no history, no baggage. There was just a vision of
products that could change the world. Who wouldn’t want to be involved
with that?”
While von Holzhausen knew the risks of going to a startup, he could not
have realized just how close Tesla was to bankruptcy when he joined the
company in August 2008. Musk had coaxed von Holzhausen away from a
secure job and into the jaws of death. But in many ways, this is what von
Holzhausen sought at this point in his career. Tesla did not feel as much like
a car company as a bunch of guys tinkering on a big idea. “To me, it was
exciting,” he said. “It was like a garage experiment, and it made cars cool
again.” The suits were gone, and so were the veteran automotive hands
dulled by years working in the industry. In their stead, von Holzhausen
found energetic geeks who didn’t realize that what they wanted to do was
borderline impossible. Musk’s presence added to the energy and gave von
Holzhausen confidence that Tesla actually could outflank much, much
larger competitors. “Elon’s mind was always way beyond the present
moment,” he said. “You could see that he was a step or three ahead of
everyone else and one hundred percent committed to what we were doing.”
Von Holzhausen had examined the drawings of the Model S left by
Fisker and a clay model of the car and had come away unimpressed. “It was
a blob,” he said. “It was clear to me that the people that had been working
on this were novices.” Musk realized the same thing and tried to articulate
what he wanted. Even though the words were not precise, they were good
enough to give von Holzhausen a feel for Musk’s vision and the confidence
that he could deliver on it. “I said, ‘We’re going to start over. We’re going
to work together and make this awesome.’”
To save money, the Tesla design center came to life inside the SpaceX
factory. A handful of people on von Holzhausen’s team took over one
corner and put up a tent to add some separation and secrecy to what they
were doing. In the tradition of many a Musk employee, von Holzhausen had
to build his own office. He made a pilgrimage to IKEA to buy some desks
and then went to an art store to get some paper and pens.
As von Holzhausen began sketching the outside of the Model S, the
Tesla engineers had started up a project to build another electric CLS. They
ripped this one down to its very core, removing all of the body structure and
then stretching the wheelbase by four inches to match up with some of the
early Model S specifications. Things began moving fast for everyone
involved in the Model S project. In the span of about three months, von
Holzhausen had designed 95 percent of what people see today with the
Model S, and the engineers had started building a prototype exterior around
the skeleton.
Throughout this process, von Holzhausen and Musk talked every day.
Their desks were close, and the men had a natural rapport. Musk said he
wanted an aesthetic that borrowed from Aston Martin and Porsche and
some specific functions. He insisted, for example, that the car seat seven
people. “It was like ‘Holy shit, how do we pull this off in a sedan?’” von
Holzhausen said. “But I understood. He had five kids and wanted
something that could be thought of as a family vehicle, and he knew other
people would have this issue.”
Musk wanted to make another statement with a huge touchscreen. This
was years before the iPad would be released. The touch-screens that people
ran into now and again at airports or shopping kiosks were for the most part
terrible. But to Musk, the iPhone and all of its touch functions made it
obvious that this type of technology would soon become commonplace. He
would make a giant iPhone and have it handle most of the car’s functions.
To find the right size for the screen, Musk and von Holzhausen would sit in
the skeleton car and hold up laptops of different sizes, placing them
horizontally and vertically to see what looked best. They settled on a
seventeen-inch screen in a vertical position. Drivers would tap on this
screen for every task except for opening the glove box and turning on the
emergency lights—jobs required by law to be performed with physical
buttons.
Since the battery pack at the base of the car would weigh so much,
Musk, the designers, and the engineers were always looking for ways to
reduce the Model S’s weight in other spots. Musk opted to solve a big
chunk of this problem by making the body of the Model S out of
lightweight aluminum instead of steel. “The non-battery-pack portion of the
car has to be lighter than comparable gasoline cars, and making it all
aluminum became the obvious decision,” Musk said. “The fundamental
problem was that if we didn’t make it out of aluminum the car wasn’t going
to be any good.”
Musk’s word choice there—“obvious decision”—goes a long way
toward explaining how he operates. Yes, the car needed to be light, and, yes,
aluminum would be an option for making that happen. But at the time, car
manufacturers in North America had almost no experience producing
aluminum body panels. Aluminum tends to tear when worked by large
presses. It also develops lines that look like stretch marks on skin and make
it difficult to lay down smooth coats of paint. “In Europe, you had some
Jaguars and one Audi that were made of aluminum, but it was less than five
percent of the market,” Musk said. “In North America, there was nothing.
It’s only recently that the Ford F-150 has arrived as mostly aluminum.
Before that, we were the only one.” Inside of Tesla, attempts were
repeatedly made to talk Musk out of the aluminum body, but he would not
budge, seeing it as the only rational choice. It would be up to the Tesla team
to figure out how to make the aluminum manufacturing happen. “We knew
it could be done,” Musk said. “It was a question of how hard it would be
and how long it would take us to sort it out.”
Just about all of the major design choices with the Model S came with
similar challenges. “When we first talked about the touch-screen, the guys
came back and said, ‘There’s nothing like that in the automotive supply
chain,’” Musk said. “I said, ‘I know. That’s because it’s never been put in a
fucking car before.’” Musk figured that computer manufacturers had tons of
experience making seventeen-inch laptop screens and expected them to
knock out a screen for the Model S with relative ease. “The laptops are
pretty robust,” Musk said. “You can drop them and leave them out in the
sun, and they still have to work.” After contacting the laptop suppliers,
Tesla’s engineers came back and said that the temperature and vibration
loads for the computers did not appear to be up to automotive standards.
Tesla’s supplier in Asia also kept pointing the carmaker to its automotive
division instead of its computing division. As Musk dug into the situation
more, he discovered that the laptop screens simply had not been tested
before under the tougher automotive conditions, which included large
temperature fluctuations. When Tesla performed the tests, the electronics
ended up working just fine. Tesla also started working hand in hand with
the Asian manufacturers to perfect their then-immature capacitive-touch
technology and to find ways to hide the wiring behind the screen that made
the touch technology possible. “I’m pretty sure that we ended up with the
only seventeen-inch touch-screen in the world,” Musk said. “None of the
computer makers or Apple had made it work yet.”
The Tesla engineers were radical by automotive industry standards but
even they had problems fully committing to Musk’s vision. “They wanted
to put in a bloody switch or a button for the lights,” Musk said. “Why
would we need a switch? When it’s dark, turn the lights on.” Next, the
engineers put up resistance to the door handles. Musk and von Holzhausen
had been studying a bunch of preliminary designs in which the handles had
yet to be drawn in and started to fall in love with how clean the car looked.
They decided that the handles should only present themselves when a
passenger needed to get in the car. Right away, the engineers realized this
would be a technological pain, and they completely ignored the idea in one
prototype version of the car, much to the dismay of Musk and von
Holzhausen. “This prototype had the handles pivot instead of popping out,”
von Holzhausen said. “I was upset about it, and Elon said, ‘Why the fuck is
this different? We’re not doing this.’”
To crank up the pace of the Model S design, there were engineers
working all day and then others who would show up at 9 P.M. and work
through the night. Both groups huddled inside of the 3,000-square-foot tent
placed on the SpaceX factory floor. Their workspace looked like a reception
area at an outdoor wedding. “The SpaceX guys were amazingly respectful
and didn’t peek or ask questions,” said Ali Javidan, one of the main
engineers. As von Holzhausen delivered his specifications, the engineers
built the prototype body of the car. Every Friday afternoon, they brought
what they had made into a courtyard behind the factory where Musk would
look it over and provide feedback. To run tests on the body, the car would
be loaded up with ballast to represent five people and then do loops around
the factory until it overheated or broke down.
The more von Holzhausen learned about Tesla’s financial struggles, the
more he wanted the public to see the Model S. “Things were so precarious,
and I didn’t want to miss our opportunity to get this thing finished and show
it to the world,” he said. That moment came in March 2009, when, just six
months after von Holzhausen had arrived, Tesla unveiled the Model S at a
press event held at SpaceX.
Amid rocket engines and hunks of aluminum, Tesla showcased a gray
Model S sedan. From a distance, the display model looked glamorous and
refined. The media reports from the day described the car as the love child
of an Aston Martin and a Maserati. In reality, the sedan barely held together.
It still had the base structure of a Mercedes CLS, although no one in the
press knew that, and some of the body panels and the hood were stuck to
the frame with magnets. “They could just slide the hood right off,” said
Bruce Leak, a Tesla owner invited to attend the event. “It wasn’t really
attached. They would put it back on and try and align it to get the fit and
finish right, but then someone would push on it, and it would move again. It
was one of those Wizard of Oz, man behind the curtain moments.” A couple
of the Tesla engineers practiced test-driving the car for a couple of days
leading up to the event to make sure that they knew just how long the car
would go before it overheated. While not perfect, the display accomplished
exactly what Musk had intended. It reminded people that Tesla had a
credible plan to make electric cars more mainstream and that its cars were
far more ambitious than what big-time automakers like GM and Nissan
seemed to have in mind both from a design and a range perspective.
The messy reality behind the display was that the odds of Tesla
advancing the Model S from a prop to a sellable car were infinitesimal. The
company had the technical know-how and the will for the job. It just didn’t
have much money or a factory that could crank out cars by the thousands.
Building an entire car would require blanking machines that take sheets of
aluminum and chop them up into the appropriate size for doors, hoods, and
body panels. Next up would be the massive stamping machines and metal
dies used to take the aluminum and bend it into precise shapes. Then there
would be dozens of robots that would aid in assembling the cars, computercontrolled
milling machines for precise metalwork, painting equipment, and
a bevy of other machines for running tests. It was an investment that would
run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Musk would also need to hire
thousands of workers.
As with SpaceX, Musk preferred to build as much of Tesla’s vehicles
in-house as possible, but the high costs were limiting just how much Tesla
could take on. “The original plan was that we would do final assembly,”
said Diarmuid O’Connell, the vice president of business development at
Tesla. Partners would stamp out the body parts, do the welding and handle
the painting, and ship everything to Tesla, where workers would turn the
parts into a whole car. Tesla proposed to build a factory to handle this type
of work first in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and then later in San Jose,
California, and then pulled back on these proposals, much to the dismay of
city officials in both locales. The public hemming and hawing around
picking the factory site did little to inspire confidence in Tesla’s ability to
knock out a second car and generated the same type of negative headlines
that had surrounded the Roadster’s protracted delivery.
O’Connell had joined Tesla in 2006 to help solve some of the factory
and financing issues. He grew up near Boston in a middle-class Irish family
and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College. After
that, O’Connell attended the University of Virginia to get a master’s degree
in foreign policy and then Northwestern, where he got an MBA from the
Kellogg School of Management. He had fancied himself a scholar of the
Soviet Union and its foreign and economic policy and had studied these
areas at UVa. “But then, in 1988 and 1989, they’re starting to close down
the Soviet Union, and, at the very least, I had a brand problem,” O’Connell
said. “It started looking to me like I was heading to a career in academia or
intelligence.” It was then that O’Connell’s career took a detour into the
business world, where he became a management consultant working for
McCann Erickson Worldwide, Young & Rubicam, and Accenture, advising
companies like Coca-Cola and AT&T.
O’Connell’s career path changed more drastically in 2001 when the
planes hit the twin towers in New York. In the wake of the terrorist attacks,
O’Connell, like many people, decided to serve the United States in any
capacity that he could. In his late thirties, he had missed the window to be a
soldier and instead focused his attention on trying to get into national
security work. O’Connell went from office to office in Washington, D.C.,
looking for a job and had little luck until Lincoln Bloomfield, the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs, heard him out. Bloomfield
needed someone who could help prioritize missions in the Middle East and
make sure the right people were working on the right things, and he figured
that O’Connell’s management consulting experience made him a nice fit for
the job. O’Connell became Bloomfield’s chief of staff and dealt with a wide
range of charged situations, from trade negotiations to setting up an
embassy in Baghdad. After gaining security clearance, O’Connell also had
access to a daily report that collected information from intelligence and
military personnel on the status of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“Every morning at six A.M., the first thing to hit my desk was this overnight
report that included information on who got killed and what killed them,”
O’Connell said. “I kept thinking, This is insane. Why are we in this place?
It was not just Iraq but the whole picture. Why were we so invested in that
part of the world?” The unsurprising answer that O’Connell came up with
was oil.
The more O’Connell dug into the United States’ dependence on foreign
oil, the more frustrated and despondent he became. “My clients were
basically the combat commanders—people in charge of Latin America and
Central Command,” he said. “As I talked with them and studied and
researched, I realized that even in peacetime, so many of our assets were
employed to support the economic pipeline around oil.” O’Connell decided
that the rational thing to do for his country and for his newborn son was to
alter this equation. He looked at the wind industry and the solar industry
and the traditional automakers but came away unconvinced that what they
were doing could have a radical enough impact on the status quo. Then,
while reading Businessweek, he stumbled on an article about a start-up
called Tesla Motors and went to the company’s website, which described
Tesla as a place “where we are doing things, not talking about things.” “I
sent an e-mail telling them I had come from the national security area and
was really passionate about reducing our dependence on oil and figured it
was just a dead-letter type of thing,” O’Connell said. “I got an e-mail back
the next day.”
Musk hired O’Connell and quickly dispatched him to Washington, D.C.,
to start poking around on what types of tax credits and rebates Tesla might
be able to drum up around its electric vehicles. At the same time, O’Connell
drafted an application for a Department of Energy stimulus package.* “All I
knew is that we were going to need a shitload of money to build this
company,” O’Connell said. “My view was that we needed to explore
everything.” Tesla had been looking for between $100 million and $200
million, grossly underestimating what it would take to build the Model S.
“We were naïve and learning our way in the business,” O’Connell said.
It January 2009, Tesla took over Porsche’s usual spot at the Detroit auto
show, getting the space cheap because so many other car companies had
bailed out on the event. Fisker had a luxurious booth across the hallway
with wood flooring and pretty blond booth babes draped over its car. Tesla
had the Roadster, its electric powertrain, and no frills.
The technology that Tesla’s engineers displayed proved good enough to
attract the attention of the big boys. Not long after the show, Daimler voiced
some interest in seeing what an electric Mercedes A Class car might look
and feel like. Daimler executives said they would visit Tesla in about a
month to discuss this proposition in detail, and the Tesla engineers decided
to blow them away by producing two prototype vehicles before the visit.
When the Daimler executives saw what Tesla had done, they ordered four
thousand of Tesla’s battery packs for a fleet of test vehicles in Germany.
The Tesla team pulled off the same kind of feats for Toyota and won its
business, too.
In May 2009, things started to take off for Tesla. The Model S had been
unveiled, and Daimler followed that by acquiring a 10 percent stake in Tesla
for $50 million. The companies also formed a strategic partnership to have
Tesla provide the battery packs for one thousand of Daimler’s Smart cars.
“That money was important and went a long way back then,” said
O’Connell. “It was also a validation. Here is the company that invented the
internal combustion engine, and they are investing in us. It was a seminal
moment, and I am sure it gave the guys over at the DOE the feeling that we
were real. It’s not just our scientists saying this stuff is good. It’s Mercedes
freaking Benz.”
Sure enough, in January 2010, the Department of Energy struck a $465
million loan agreement with Tesla.* The money was far more than Tesla
had ever expected to get from the government. But it still represented just a
fraction of the $1 billion plus that most carmakers needed to bring a new
vehicle to market. So, while Musk and O’Connell were thrilled to get the
money, they still wondered if Tesla would be able to live up to the bargain.
Tesla would need one more windfall or, perhaps, to steal a car factory. And
in May 2010, that’s more or less what it did.
General Motors and Toyota had teamed up in 1984 to build New United
Motor Manufacturing Inc., or NUMMI, on the site of a former GM
assembly plant in Fremont, California, a city on the outskirts of Silicon
Valley. The companies hoped the joint facility would combine the best of
American and Japanese automaking skills and result in higher-quality,
cheaper cars. The factory went on to pump out millions of vehicles like the
Chevy Nova and Toyota Corolla. Then the recession hit, and GM found
itself trying to climb out of bankruptcy. It decided to abandon the plant in
2009, and Toyota followed right after, saying it would close down the whole
facility, leaving five thousand people without jobs.
All of a sudden, Tesla had the chance to buy a 5.3-million-square-foot
plant in its backyard. Just one month after the last Toyota Corolla went off
the manufacturing line in April 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a
partnership and transfer of the factory. Tesla agreed to pay $42 million for a
large portion of the factory (once worth $1 billion), while Toyota invested
$50 million in Tesla for a 2.5 percent stake in the company. Tesla had
basically secured a factory, including the massive metal-stamping machines
and other equipment, for free.*
The string of fortunate turns for Tesla left Musk feeling good. Just after
the factory deal closed in the summer of 2010, Tesla started the process of
filing for an initial public offering. The company obviously needed as much
capital as it could get to bring the Model S to market and push forward with
its other technology projects. Tesla hoped to raise about $200 million.
For Musk, going public represented something of a Faustian bargain.
Ever since the Zip2 and PayPal days, Musk has done everything in his
power to maintain absolute control over his companies. Even if he remained
the largest shareholder in Tesla, the company would be subjected to the
capricious nature of the public markets. Musk, the ultimate long-term
thinker, would face constant second-guessing from investors looking for
short-term returns. Tesla would also be subject to public scrutiny, as it
would be forced to open its books for public consumption. This was bad
because Musk prefers to operate in secrecy and because Tesla’s financial
situation looked awful. The company had one product (the Roadster), had
huge development costs, and had bordered on bankruptcy months earlier.
The car blog Jalopnik greeted the Tesla IPO as a Hail Mary rather than a
sound fiscal move. “For lack of a better phrase, Tesla is a money pit,” the
blog wrote. “Since the company’s founding in 2003, it’s managed to incur
over $290 million in losses on just $147.6 million in revenue.” Told by a
source that Tesla hoped to sell 20,000 units of the Model S per year at
$58,000 a pop, Jalopnik scoffed. “Even considering the supposed pent-up
demand among environmentalists for a car like the Model S, those are
ambitious goals for a small company planning to launch a niche luxury
product into a soft market. Frankly, we’re skeptical. We’ve seen how brutal
and unforgiving the market can be, and other automakers aren’t simply
going to roll over and surrender that volume to Tesla.” Other pundits
concurred with this assessment.
Tesla went public on June 29, 2010, nonetheless. It raised $226 million,
with the company’s shares shooting up 41 percent that day. Investors looked
past Tesla’s $55.7 million loss in 2009 and the more than $300 million the
company had spent in seven years. The IPO stood as the first for an
American carmaker since Ford went public in 1956. Competitors continued
to treat Tesla like an annoying, ankle-biting dachshund. Nissan’s CEO,
Carlos Ghosn, used the event to remind people that Tesla was but a
pipsqueak and that his company had plans to pump out up to 500,000
electric cars by 2012.
Flush with funds, Musk began expanding some of the engineering teams
and formalizing the development work around the Model S. Tesla’s main
offices moved from San Mateo to a larger building in Palo Alto, and von
Holzhausen expanded the design team in Los Angeles. Javidan hopped
between projects, helping develop technology for the electrified Mercedes-
Benz, an electric Toyota Rav4, and prototypes of the Model S. The Tesla
team worked fast inside of a tiny lab with about 45 people knocking out 35
Rav4 test vehicles at the rate of about two cars per week. The alpha version
of the Model S, including newly stamped body parts from the Fremont
factory, a revamped battery pack, and revamped power electronics, came to
life in the basement of the Palo Alto office. “The first prototype was
finished at about two A.M.,” Javidan said. “We were so excited that we
drove it around without glass, any interior, or a hood.”
A day or two later, Musk came to check out the vehicle. He jumped into
the car and drove it to the opposite end of the basement, where he could
spend some time alone with it. He got out and walked around the vehicle,
and then the engineers came over to hear his take on the machine. This
process would be repeated many times in the months to come. “He would
generally be positive but constructive,” Javidan said. “We would try and get
him rides whenever we could, and he might ask for the steering to be tighter
or something like that before running off to another meeting.”
About a dozen of the alpha cars were produced. A couple went to
suppliers like Bosch to begin work on the braking systems, while others
were used for various tests and design tweaks. Tesla’s executives kept the
vehicles rotating on a strict schedule, giving one team two weeks for coldweather
testing and then shipping that alpha car to another team right away
for powertrain tuning. “The guys from Toyota and Daimler were blown
away,” Javidan said. “They might have two hundred alpha cars and several
hundred to a thousand beta cars. We were doing everything from crash tests
to the interior design with about fifteen cars. That was amazing to them.”
Tesla employees developed similar techniques to their counterparts at
SpaceX for dealing with Musk’s high demands. The savvy engineers knew
better than to go into a meeting and deliver bad news without some sort of
alternative plan at the ready. “One of the scariest meetings was when we
needed to ask Elon for an extra two weeks and more money to build out
another version of the Model S,” Javidan said. “We put together a plan,
stating how long things would take and what they would cost. We told him
that if he wanted the car in thirty days it would require hiring some new
people, and we presented him with a stack of resumes. You don’t tell Elon
you can’t do something. That will get you kicked out of the room. You need
everything lined up. After we presented the plan, he said, ‘Okay, thanks.’
Everyone was like, ‘Holy shit, he didn’t fire you.’”
There were times when Musk would overwhelm the Tesla engineers
with his requests. He took a Model S prototype home for a weekend and
came back on the Monday asking for around eighty changes. Since Musk
never writes anything down, he held all the alterations in his head and
would run down the checklist week by week to see what the engineers had
fixed. The same engineering rules as those at SpaceX applied. You did what
Musk asked or were prepared to burrow down into the properties of
materials to explain why something could not be done. “He always said,
‘Take it down to the physics,’” Javidan said.
As the development of the Model S neared completion in 2012, Musk
refined his requests and dissection style. He went over the Model S with
von Holzhausen every Friday at Tesla’s design studio in Los Angeles. Von
Holzhausen and his small team had moved out of the corner in the SpaceX
factory and gotten their own hangar-shaped facility near the rear of the
SpaceX complex.* The building had a few offices and then one large, wideopen
area where various mock-ups of vehicles and parts awaited inspection.
During a visit I made in 2012, there was one complete Model S, a skeletal
version of the Model X—an as yet to be released SUV—and a selection of
tires and hubcaps lined up against the wall. Musk sank into the Model S
driver seat and von Holzhausen climbed into the passenger seat. Musk’s
eyes darted around for a few moments and then settled onto the sun visor. It
was beige and a visible seam ran around the edge and pushed the fabric out.
“It’s fish-lipped,” Musk said. The screws attaching the visor to the car were
visible as well, and Musk insisted that every time he saw them it felt like
tiny daggers were stabbing him in the eyes. The whole situation was
unacceptable. “We have to decide what is the best sun visor in the world
and then do better,” Musk said. A couple of assistants taking notes outside
of the car jotted this down.
This process played out again with the Model X. This was to be Tesla’s
merger of an SUV and a minivan built off the Model S foundation. Von
Holzhausen had four different versions of the vehicle’s center console
resting on the floor, so that they could be slotted in one by one and viewed
by Musk. The pair spent most of their time, however, agonizing over the
middle row of seats. Each one had an independent base so that each
passenger could adjust his seat rather than moving the whole row
collectively. Musk loved the freedom this gave the passenger but grew
concerned after seeing all three seats in different positions. “The problem is
that they will never be aligned and might look a mess,” Musk said. “We
have to make sure they are not too hodgy podgy.”
The idea of Musk as a design expert has long struck me as bizarre. He’s
a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor. So much of who Musk is
says that he should fall into that Silicon Valley stereotype of the schlubby
nerd who would only know good design if he read about it in a textbook.
The truth is that there might be some of that going on with Musk, and he’s
turned it into an advantage. He’s very visual and can store things that others
have deemed to look good away in his brain for recall at any time. This
process has helped Musk develop a good eye, which he’s combined with his
own sensibilities, while also refining his ability to put what he wants into
words. The result is a confident, assertive perspective that does resonate
with the tastes of consumers. Like Steve Jobs before him, Musk is able to
think up things that consumers did not even know they wanted—the door
handles, the giant touch-screen—and to envision a shared point of view for
all of Tesla’s products and services. “Elon holds Tesla up as a product
company,” von Holzhausen said. “He’s passionate that you have to get the
product right. I have to deliver for him and make sure it’s beautiful and
attractive.”
With the Model X, Musk again turned to his role as a dad to shape some
of the flashiest design elements of the vehicle. He and von Holzhausen were
walking around the floor of an auto show in Los Angeles, and they both
complained about the awkwardness of getting to the middle and back row
seats in an SUV. Parents who have felt their backs wrench while trying to
angle a child and car seat into a vehicle know this reality all too well, as
does any decent-sized human who has tried to wedge into a third row seat.
“Even on a minivan, which is supposed to have more room, almost onethird
of the entry space is covered by the sliding door,” von Holzhausen
said. “If you could open up the car in a way that is unique and special, that
could be a real game changer. We took that kernel of an idea back and
worked up forty or fifty design concepts to solve the problem, and I think
we ended up with one of the most radical ones.” The Model X has what
Musk coined as “falcon-wing doors.” They’re hinged versions of the gullwing
doors found on some high-end cars like the DeLorean. The doors go
up and then flop over in a constrained enough way that the Model X won’t
rub up against a car parked close to it or hit the ceiling in a garage. The end
result is that a parent can plop a child in the second-row passenger seat
without needing to bend over or twist at all.
When Tesla’s engineers first heard about the falcon-wing doors, they
cringed. Here was Musk with another crazy ask. “Everyone tried to come
up with an excuse as to why we couldn’t do it,” Javidan said. “You can’t put
it in the garage. It won’t work with things like skis. Then, Elon took a demo
model to his house and showed us that the doors opened. Everyone is
mumbling, ‘Yeah, in a fifteen-million-dollar house, the doors will open just
fine.’” Like the controversial door handles on the Model S, the Model X’s
doors have become one of its most striking features and the thing
consumers talk about the most. “I was one of the first people to test it out
with a kid’s car seat,” Javidan said. “We have a minivan, and you have to be
a contortionist to get the seat into the middle row. Compared to that, the
Model X was so easy. If it’s a gimmick, it’s a gimmick that works.”
During my 2012 visit to the design studio, Tesla had a number of
competitors’ vehicles in the parking lot nearby, and Musk made sure to
demonstrate the limitations of their seating compared to the Model X. He
tried with honest effort to sit in the third row of an Acura SUV, but, even
though the car claimed to have room for seven, Musk’s knees were pressed
up to his chin, and he never really fit into the seat. “That’s like a midget
cave,” he said. “Anyone can make a car big on the outside. The trick is to
make it big on the inside.” Musk went from one rival’s car to the next,
illuminating the vehicles’ flaws for me and von Holzhausen. “It’s good to
get a sense for just how bad the other cars are,” he said.
When these statements fly out of Musk’s mouth, it’s momentarily
shocking. Here’s a guy who needed nine years to produce about three
thousand cars ridiculing automakers that build millions of vehicles every
year. In that context, his ribbing comes off as absurd.
Musk, though, approaches everything from a Platonic perspective. As
he sees it, all of the design and technology choices should be directed
toward the goal of making a car as close to perfect as possible. To the extent
that rival automakers haven’t, that’s what Musk is judging. It’s almost a
binary experience for him. Either you’re trying to make something
spectacular with no compromises or you’re not. And if you’re not, Musk
considers you a failure. This position can look unreasonable or foolish to
outsiders, but the philosophy works for Musk and constantly pushes him
and those around him to their limits.
On June 22, 2012, Tesla invited all of its employees, some select
customers, and the press to its factory in Fremont to watch as the first
Model S sedans were taken home. Depending on which of the many
promised delivery dates you pick, the Model S was anywhere from eighteen
months to two-plus years late. Some of the delays were a result of Musk’s
requests for exotic technologies that needed to be invented. Other delays
were simply a function of this still quite young automaker learning how to
produce an immaculate luxury vehicle and needing to go through the trial
and error tied to becoming a more mature, more refined company.
The outsiders were blown away by their first glimpse of the Tesla
factory. Musk had T-E-S-L-A painted in enormous black letters on the side
of the building so that people driving by on the freeway, or flying above for
that matter, were made well aware of the company’s presence. The inside of
the factory, once dressed in the dark, dingy tones of General Motors and
Toyota, had taken on the Musk aesthetic. The floors received a white epoxy,
the walls and beams were painted white, the thirty-foot tall stamping
machines were white, and then much of the other machinery, like the teams
of the robots, had been painted red, making the place look like an industrial
version of Santa Claus’s workshop. Just as he did at SpaceX, Musk placed
the desks of his engineers right on the factory floor, where they worked in
an area cordoned off by rudimentary cubicle dividers. Musk had a desk in
this area as well.*
The Model S launch event took place in a section of the factory where
they finish off the cars. There’s a part of the floor with various grooves and
bumps that the cars pass over, as technicians listen for any rattles. There’s
also a chamber where water can be sprayed at high pressure onto the car to
check for leaks. For the very last inspection, the Model S cruises onto a
raised platform made out of bamboo, which, when coupled with lots of
LED lighting, is meant to provide an abundant amount of contrast so that
people can spot flaws on the body. For the few first months that the Model
S came off the line, Musk went to this bamboo stage to inspect every
vehicle. “He was down on all fours looking up under the wheel well,” said
Steve Jurvetson, the investor and Tesla board member.
Hundreds of people had gathered around this stage to watch as the first
dozen or so cars were presented to their owners. Many of the employees
were factory workers who had once been part of the autoworkers’ union,
lost their jobs when the NUMMI plant closed, and were now back at work
again, making the car of the future. They waved American flags and wore
red, white, and blue visors. A handful of the workers cried as the Model S
sedans were lined up on the stage. Even Musk’s most cynical critics would
have softened for a moment while watching the proceedings. Say what you
will about Tesla receiving government money or hyping up the promise of
the electric car, it was trying to do something big and different, and people
were getting hired by the thousands as a result. With machines humming in
the background, Musk gave a brief speech and then handed the owners their
keys. They drove off the bamboo platform and out the factory doors, while
the Tesla employees provided a standing ovation.
Just four weeks earlier, SpaceX had flown cargo to the International
Space Station and had its capsule returned to Earth—firsts all around for a
private company. That feat coupled with the launch of the Model S led to a
rapid transformation in the way the world outside of Silicon Valley
perceived Musk. The guy who was always promising, promising, promising
was doing—and doing spectacular things. “I may have been optimistic with
respect to the timing on some of these things, but I didn’t over-promise on
the outcome,” Musk told me during an interview after the Model S launch.
“I have done everything I said I was going to do.”
Musk did not have Riley around to celebrate with and share in this run
of good fortune. They had divorced, and Musk had begun to think about
dating again, if he could find the time. Even with this turmoil in his
personal life, however, Musk had reached a point of calm that he had not
felt in many years. “My main emotion is that there is a bit of weight off my
shoulders,” he said at the time. Musk took his boys to Maui to meet up with
Kimbal and other relatives, marking his first real vacation in a number of
years.
It was right after this holiday that Musk let me have the first substantial
glimpse into his life. Skin still peeling off his sunburnt arms, Musk met
with me at the Tesla and SpaceX headquarters, at the Tesla design studio,
and at a Beverley Hills screening of a documentary he had helped sponsor.
The film, Baseball in the Time of Cholera, was good but grim and explored
a cholera outbreak in Haiti. It turned out that Musk had visited Haiti the
previous Christmas, filling his jet with toys and MacBook Airs for an
orphanage. Bryn Mooser, the codirector of the film, told me that during a
barbecue Musk had taught the kids how to fire off model rockets and then
later went to visit a village deeper in the jungle by traveling in a dugout
canoe. After the screening, Musk and I hung out on the street for a bit away
from the crowd. I noted aloud that everyone wants to make him out as the
Tony Stark character but that he didn’t really exude that “playboy drinking
scotch while zooming through Afghanistan in an army convoy” vibe. He
fired back, pointing to the Haitian canoe ride. “I got wasted, too, on some
drink they call the Zombie,” Musk said. He smiled and then invited me to
grab some drinks across the street at Mr. Chow to celebrate the movie. All
seemed to be going well for Musk, and he savored the moment.
This restful period did not last long and soon enough Tesla’s battle for
survival resumed. The company could only produce about ten sedans per
week at the outset and had thousands of back orders that it needed to fulfill.
Short sellers, those investors who bet a company’s share price will fall, had
taken huge positions in Tesla, making it the most shorted stock out of one
hundred of the largest companies listed on the NASDAQ exchange. The
naysayers expected numerous Model S flaws to crop up and undermine the
enthusiasm for the car, to the point that people started canceling their orders
in bulk. There were also huge doubts that Tesla could ramp up production in
a meaningful way and do so profitably. In October 2012, the presidential
hopeful Mitt Romney dubbed Tesla “a loser,” while slagging off a couple of
other government-backed green technology companies (the solar panel
maker Solyndra and Fisker) during a debate with Barack Obama.14
While the doubters placed huge wagers on Tesla’s impending failure,
Musk’s bluster mode engaged. He began talking about Tesla’s goals to
become the most profitable major automobile maker in the world, with
better margins than BMW. Then, in September 2012, he unveiled something
that shocked both Tesla critics and proponents alike. Tesla had secretly been
building the first leg of a network of charging stations. The company
disclosed the location of six stations in California, Nevada, and Arizona and
promised that hundreds more would be on the way. Tesla intended to build a
global charging network that would let Model S owners making long drives
pull off the highway and recharge very quickly. And they would be able to
do so for free. In fact, Musk insisted that Tesla owners would soon be able
to travel across the United States without spending a penny on fuel. Model
S drivers would have no trouble finding these stations, not only because the
cars’ onboard computers would guide them to the nearest one but because
Musk and von Holzhausen had designed giant red and white monoliths to
herald the appearance of the stations.
The Supercharging stations, as Tesla called them, represented a huge
investment for the strapped company. An argument could easily be made
that spending money on this sort of thing at such a precarious moment in
the Model S and Tesla’s history was somewhere between daft and batshit
crazy. Surely Musk did not have the gall to try to revamp the very idea of
the automobile and build an energy network at the same time with a budget
equivalent to what Ford and ExxonMobil spend on their annual holiday
parties. But that was the exact plan. Musk, Straubel, and others inside Tesla
had mapped out this all-or-nothing play long ago and built certain features
into the Model S with the Superchargers in mind.*
While the arrival of the Model S and the charging network garnered
Tesla a ton of headlines, it remained unclear if the positive press and good
vibes would last. Serious trade-offs had been made as Tesla rushed to get
the Model S to market. The car had some spectacular, novel features. But
everyone inside of the company knew that as far as luxury sedans went, the
Model S did not match up feature to feature with cars from BMW and
Mercedes-Benz. The first few thousand Model S cars, for example, would
ship without the parking sensors and radar-assisted cruise control common
on other high-end cars. “It was either hire a team of fifty people right away
to make one of these things happen or implement things as best and as fast
as you could,” Javidan said.
The subpar fit and finish also proved hard to explain. The early adopters
could tolerate a windshield wiper going haywire for a couple of days, but
they wanted to see seats and visors that met the $100,000 price tag. While
Tesla did its best to source the highest-quality materials, it struggled at
times to convince the top suppliers to take the company seriously.15 “People
were very suspect that we would deliver one thousand Model Ss,” said von
Holzhausen. “It was frustrating because we had the drive internally to make
the car perfect but could not get the same commitment externally. With
something like the visor, we ended up having to go to a third-rate supplier
and then work on fixing the situation after the car had already started
shipping.” The cosmetic issues, though, were minor compared to a
tumultuous set of internal circumstances, revealed in detail here for the first
time, that threatened to bankrupt the company once again.
Musk had hired George Blankenship, a former Apple executive, to run
its stores and service-center operations. At Apple, Blankenship worked just
a couple of doors down from Steve Jobs and received credit for building
much of the Apple Store strategy. When Tesla first hired Blankenship, the
press and public were atwitter, anticipating that’d he do something
spectacular and at odds with the traditions of the automotive industry.
Blankenship did some of that. He expanded Tesla’s number of stores
throughout the world and imbued them with that Apple Store vibe. Along
with showcasing the Model S, the Tesla stores sold hoodies and hats and
had areas in the back where kids would find crayons and Tesla coloring
books. Blankenship gave me a tour of the Tesla store on Santana Row, the
glitzy shopping center in San Jose. He came off as a warm, grandfatherly
sort who saw Tesla as his chance to make a difference. “The typical dealer
wants to sell you a car on the spot to clear inventory off his lot,”
Blankenship said. “The goal here is to develop a relationship with Tesla and
electric vehicles.” Tesla, he said, wanted to turn the Model S into more than
a car. Ideally it would be an object of desire just like the iPod and iPhone.
Blankenship noted that Tesla had more than ten thousand reservations for
the Model S at the time, the vast majority of which had arrived without the
customers test-driving the car. A lot of this early interest resulted from the
aura surrounding Musk, who Blankenship said came off as similar to Jobs
but with a toned-down control-freak vibe. “This is the first place I have
worked that is going to change the world,” Blankenship said, taking a jab at
the sometimes trivial nature of Apple’s gadgets.
While Musk and Blankenship got along at first, their relationship fell
apart during the latter stages of 2012. Tesla did have a large number of
reservations in which people put down $5,000 for the right to buy a Model
S and get in the purchase queue. But the company had struggled to turn
these reservations into actual sales. The reasons behind this problem remain
unclear. It may have been that the complaints about the interior and the
early kinks mentioned on the Tesla forums and message boards were
causing concerns. Tesla also lacked financing options to soften the blow of
buying a $100,000 car, while uncertainty surrounded the resale market for
the Model S. You might end up with the car of the future or you might
spend six figures on a dud with a battery pack that loses its capacity, and
with no secondary buyer. Tesla’s service centers at the time were also
terrible. The early cars were unreliable and customers were being sent in
droves to centers unprepared to handle the volume. Many prospective Tesla
owners likely wanted to hang out on the sidelines for a bit longer to make
sure that the company would remain viable. As Musk put it, “The word of
mouth on the car sucked.”
By the middle of February 2013, Tesla had fallen into a crisis state. If it
could not convert its reservations to purchases quickly, its factory would sit
idle, costing the company vast amounts of money. And if anyone caught
wind of the factory slowdown, Tesla’s shares would likely plummet,
prospective owners would become even more cautious, and the short sellers
would win. The severity of this problem had been hidden from Musk, but
once he learned about it, he acted in his signature all-or-nothing fashion.
Musk pulled people from recruiting, the design studio, engineering, finance,
and wherever else he could find them and ordered them to get on the phone,
call people with reservations, and close deals. “If we don’t deliver these
cars, we are fucked,” Musk told the employees. “So, I don’t care what job
you were doing. Your new job is delivering cars.” He placed Jerome
Guillen, a former Daimler executive, in charge of fixing the service issues.
Musk fired senior leaders whom he deemed subpar performers and
promoted a flood of junior people who had been doing above-average work.
He also made an announcement personally guaranteeing the resale price of
the Model S. Customers would be able to resell their cars for the average
going rate of similar luxury sedans with Musk putting his billions behind
this pledge. And then Musk tried to orchestrate the ultimate fail-safe for
Tesla just in case his maneuvers did not work.
During the first week of April, Musk reached out to his friend Larry
Page at Google. According to people familiar with their discussion, Musk
voiced his concerns about Tesla’s ability to survive the next few weeks. Not
only were customers failing to convert their reservations to orders at the rate
Musk hoped, but existing customers had also started to defer their orders as
they heard about upcoming features and new color choices. The situation
got so bad that Tesla had to shut down its factory. Publicly, Tesla said it
needed to conduct maintenance on the factory, which was technically true,
although the company would have soldiered on had the orders been closing
as expected. Musk explained all of this to Page and then struck a handshake
deal for Google to acquire Tesla.
While Musk did not want to sell, the deal seemed like the only viable
course for Tesla’s future. Musk’s biggest fear about an acquisition was that
the new owner would not see Tesla’s goals through to their conclusion. He
wanted to make sure that the company would end up producing a massmarket
electric vehicle. Musk proposed terms under which he would remain
in control of Tesla for eight years or until it started pumping out a massmarket
car. Musk also asked for access to $5 billion in capital for factory
expansions. Some of Google’s lawyers were put off by these demands, but
Musk and Page continued to talk about the deal. Given Tesla’s value at the
time, it was thought that Google would need to pay about $6 billion for the
company.
As Musk, Page, and Google’s lawyers debated the parameters of an
acquisition, a miracle happened. The five hundred or so people whom Musk
had turned into car salesmen quickly sold a huge volume of cars. Tesla,
which only had a couple weeks of cash left in the bank, moved enough cars
in the span of about fourteen days to end up with a blowout first fiscal
quarter. Tesla stunned Wall Street on May 8, 2013, by posting its first-ever
profit as a public company—$11 million—on $562 million in sales. It
delivered 4,900 Model S sedans during the period. This announcement sent
Tesla’s shares soaring from about $30 a share to $130 per share in July. Just
a couple of weeks after revealing the first-quarter results, Tesla paid off its
$465 million loan from the government early and with interest. Tesla
suddenly appeared to have vast cash reserves at its disposal, and the short
sellers were forced to take massive losses. The solid performance of the
stock increased consumers’ confidence, creating a virtuous circle for Tesla.
With cars selling and Tesla’s value rising, the deal with Google was no
longer necessary, and Tesla had become too expensive to buy. The talks
with Google ended.*
What transpired next was the Summer of Musk. Musk put his public
relations staff on high alert, telling them that he wanted to try to have one
Tesla announcement per week. The company never quite lived up to that
pace, but it did issue statement after statement. Musk held a series of press
conferences that addressed financing for the Model S, the construction of
more charging stations, and the opening of more retail stores. During one
announcement, Musk noted that Tesla’s charging stations were solarpowered
and had batteries on-site to store extra juice. “I was joking that
even if there’s some zombie apocalypse, you’ll still be able to travel
throughout the country using the Tesla Supercharger system,” Musk said,
setting the bar very high for CEOs at other automakers. But the biggest
event by far was held in Los Angeles, where Tesla unveiled another secret
feature of the Model S.
In June 2013, Tesla cleared the prototype vehicles out of its Los
Angeles design studio and invited Tesla owners and the media for a flashy
evening soiree. Hundreds of people showed up, driving their pricey Model
S sedans through the grungy streets of Hawthorne and parking in between
the design studio and the SpaceX factory. The studio had been converted
into a lounge. The lighting was dim, and the floor had been covered in
AstroTurf and tiered to make plateaus where people could mingle or plop
down on couches. Women in tight black dresses cruised through the crowd,
serving drinks. Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” played on the sound system. A
stage had been built at the front of the room, but before Musk ascended it he
mingled with the masses. It was clear that he had become a rock star for
Tesla owners—every bit the equivalent of Steve Jobs for the Apple faithful.
People surrounded him and asked to take pictures. Meanwhile, Straubel
stood off to the side, often totally alone.
After people had a couple of drinks, Musk fought through the crowd to
the front of the room, where old TV commercials projected onto a screen
above the stage showed families stopping by Esso and Chevron stations.
The kids were so happy to see the Esso tiger mascot. “Gas is a weird thing
to love,” Musk said. “Honestly.” That’s when he brought a Model S up
onstage. A hole opened up in the floor beneath the car. It had been possible
all along, Musk said, to replace the battery pack underneath the Model S in
a matter of seconds—the company just hadn’t told anyone about this. Tesla
would now start adding battery swapping at its charging stations as a
quicker option to recharging. Someone could drive right over a pit where a
robot would take off the car’s battery pack and install a new one in ninety
seconds, at a cost equivalent to filling up with a tank of gas. “The only
decision that you have to make when you come to one of our Tesla stations
is do you prefer faster or free,” Musk said.*
In the months that followed, a couple of events threatened to derail the
Summer of Musk. The New York Times penned a withering review of the
car and its charging stations, and a couple of the Model S sedans caught fire
after being involved in collisions. Disobeying conventional public relations
wisdom, Musk went after the reporter, using data pulled from the car to
undermine the reviewer’s claims. Musk penned the feisty rebuttal himself,
while on vacation in Aspen with Kimbal, and friend and Tesla board
member Antonio Gracias. “At some other company, it would be a public
relations group putting something like this together,” Gracias said. “Elon
felt like it was the most important problem facing Tesla at the time and
that’s always what he deals with and how he prioritizes. It could kill the car
and represented an existential threat against the business. Have there been
moments where his unconventional style in these types of situations has
made me cringe? Yes. But I trust that it will work out in the end.” Musk
applied a similar approach to dealing with the fires by declaring the Model
S the safest car in America in a press release and adding a titanium
underbody shield and aluminum plates to the vehicle to deflect and destroy
debris and keep the battery pack safe.16
The fires, the occasional bad review—none of this had any effect on
Tesla’s sales or share price. Musk’s star shone brighter and brighter as
Tesla’s market value ballooned to about half that of GM and Ford.
Tesla held another press event in October 2014 that cemented Musk’s
place as the new titan of the auto industry. Musk unveiled a supercharged
version of the Model S with two motors—one in the front and one in the
back. It could go zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds. The company had turned a
sedan into a supercar. “It’s like taking off from a carrier deck,” Musk said.
“It’s just bananas.” Musk also unveiled a new suite of software for the
Model S that gave it autopilot functions. The car had radar to detect objects
and warn of possible collisions and could guide itself via GPS. “Later, you
will be able to summon the car,” Musk said. “It will come to wherever you
are. There’s also something else I would like to do. Many of our engineers
will be hearing this in real time. I would like the charge connector to plug
itself into the car, sort of like an articulating snake. I think we will probably
do something like that.”
Thousands of people waited in line for hours to see Musk demonstrate
this technology. Musk cracked jokes during the presentation and played off
the crowd’s enthusiasm. The man who had been awkward in front of media
during the PayPal years had developed a unique, slick stagecraft. A woman
standing next to me in the crowd went weak in the knees when Musk first
took the stage. A man to my other side said he wanted a Model X and had
just offered $15,000 to a friend to move up on the reservation list, so that he
could end up with model No. 700. The enthusiasm coupled with Musk’s
ability to generate attention was emblematic of just how far the little
automaker and its eccentric CEO had come. Rival car companies would kill
to receive such interest and had basically been left dumbfounded as Tesla
snuck up on them and delivered more than they had ever imagined possible.
As the Model S fever gripped Silicon Valley, I visited Ford’s small
research and development lab in Palo Alto. The head of the lab at the time
was a ponytailed, sandal-wearing engineer named T. J. Giuli, who felt very
jealous of Tesla. Inside of every Ford were dozens of computing systems
made by different companies that all had to speak to each other and work as
one. It was a mess of complexity that had evolved over time, and
simplifying the situation would prove near impossible at this point,
especially for a company like Ford, which needed to pump out hundreds of
thousands of cars per year and could not afford to stop and reboot. Tesla, by
contrast, got to start from scratch and make its own software the focus of
the Model S. Giuli would have loved the same opportunity. “Software is in
many ways the heart of the new vehicle experience,” he said. “From the
powertrain to the warning chimes in the car, you’re using software to create
an expressive and pleasing environment. The level of integration that the
software has into the rest of the Model S is really impressive. Tesla is a
benchmark for what we do here.” Not long after this chat, Giuli left Ford to
become an engineer at a stealth start-up.
There was little the mainstream auto industry could do to slow Tesla
down. But that didn’t stop executives from trying to be difficult whenever
possible. Tesla, for example, wanted to call its third-generation car the
Model E, so that its lineup of vehicles would be the Model S, E, and X—
another playful Musk gag. But Ford’s then CEO, Alan Mulally, blocked
Tesla from using Model E, with the threat of a lawsuit. “So I call up
Mulally and I was like, ‘Alan, are you just fucking with us or are you really
going to do a Model E?’” Musk said. “And I’m not sure which is worse.
You know? Like it would actually make more sense if they’re just fucking
with us because if they actually come out with a Model E at this point, and
we’ve got the Model S and the X and Ford comes out with the Model E, it’s
going to look ridiculous. So even though Ford did the Model T a hundred
years ago, nobody thinks of ‘Model’ as being a Ford thing anymore. So it
would just feel like they stole it. Like why did you go steal Tesla’s E? Like
you’re some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort of
Sesame Street robber. And he was like, ‘No, no, we’re definitely going to
use it.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t think that’s such a good idea because
people are going to be confused because it’s not going to make sense.
People aren’t used to Ford having Model something these days. It’s usually
called like the Ford Fusion.’ And he was like, no, his guys really want to
use that. That’s terrible.” After that, Tesla registered the trademark for
Model Y as another joke. “In fact, Ford called us up deadpan and said, ‘We
see you’ve registered Model Y. Is that what you’re going to use instead of
the Model E?’” Musk said. “I’m like, ‘No, it’s a joke. S-E-X-Y. What does
that spell?’ But trademark law is a dry profession it turns out.”*
What Musk had done that the rival automakers missed or didn’t have
the means to combat was turn Tesla into a lifestyle. It did not just sell
someone a car. It sold them an image, a feeling they were tapping into the
future, a relationship. Apple did the same thing decades ago with the Mac
and then again with the iPod and iPhone. Even those who were not religious
about their affiliation to Apple were sucked into its universe once they
bought the hardware and downloaded software like iTunes.
This sort of relationship is hard to pull off if you don’t control as much
of the lifestyle as possible. PC makers that farmed their software out to
Microsoft, their chips to Intel, and their design to Asia could never make
machines as beautiful and as complete as Apple’s. They also could not
respond in time as Apple took this expertise to new areas and hooked
people on its applications.
You can see Musk’s embrace of the car as lifestyle in Tesla’s
abandonment of model years. Tesla does not designate cars as being 2014s
or 2015s, and it also doesn’t have “all the 2014s in stock must go, go, go
and make room for the new cars” sales. It produces the best Model S it can
at the time, and that’s what the customer receives. This means that Tesla
does not develop and hold on to a bunch of new features over the course of
the year and then unleash them in a new model all at once. It adds features
one by one to the manufacturing line when they’re ready. Some customers
may be frustrated to miss out on a feature here and there. Tesla, however,
manages to deliver most of the upgrades as software updates that everyone
gets, providing current Model S owners with pleasant surprises.
For the Model S owner, the all-electric lifestyle translates into a less
hassled existence. Instead of going to the gas station, you just plug the car
in at night, a rhythm familiar to anyone with a smartphone. The car will
start charging right away or the owner can tap into the Model S’s software
and schedule charging to take place late at night, when the cheapest
electricity rates are available. Tesla owners not only dodge gas stations;
they mostly get to skip out on visits to mechanics. A traditional vehicle
needs oil and transmission fluid changes to deal with all the friction and
wear and tear produced by its thousands of moving parts. The simpler
electric car design eliminates this type of maintenance. Both the Roadster
and the Model S also take advantage of what’s known as regenerative
braking, which extends the life of the brakes. During stop-and-go situations,
the Tesla will brake by kicking the motor into reverse via software and
slowing down the wheels instead of using brake pads and friction to clamp
them down. The Tesla motor generates electricity during this process and
funnels it back to the batteries, which is why electric cars get better mileage
in city traffic. Tesla still recommends that owners bring in the Model S once
a year for a checkup but that’s mostly to give the vehicle a once-over and
make sure that none of the components seems to be wearing down
prematurely.
Even Tesla’s approach to maintenance is philosophically different from
that of the traditional automotive industry. Most car dealers make the
majority of their profits from servicing cars. They treat vehicles like a
subscription service, expecting people to visit their service centers multiple
times a year for many years. This is the main reason dealerships have
fought to block Tesla from selling its cars directly to consumers.* “The
ultimate goal is to never have to bring your car back in after you buy it,”
said Javidan. The dealers charge more than independent mechanics but give
people the peace of mind that their car is being worked on by a specialist
for a particular make of vehicle. Tesla makes its profits off the initial sale of
the car and then from some optional software services. “I got the number
ten Model S,” said Konstantin Othmer,17 the Silicon Valley software whiz
and entrepreneur. “It was an awesome car, but it had just about every issue
you might have read about in the forums. They would fix all these things
and decided to trailer the car back to the shop so that they didn’t add any
miles to it. Then I went in for a one-year service, and they spruced up
everything so that the car was better than new. It was surrounded by velvet
ropes in the service center. It was just beautiful.”
Tesla’s model isn’t just about being an affront to the way carmakers and
dealers do business. It’s a more subtle play on how electric cars represent a
new way to think of automobiles. All car companies will soon follow
Tesla’s lead and offer some form of over-the-air updates to their vehicles.
The practicality and scope of their updates will be limited, however. “You
just can’t do an over-the-air sparkplug change or replacement of the timing
belt,” said Javidan. “With a gas car, you have to get under the hood at some
point and that forces you back to the dealership anyway. There’s no real
incentive for Mercedes to say, ‘You don’t need to bring the car in,’ because
it’s not true.” Tesla also has the edge of having designed so many of the key
components for its cars in-house, including the software running throughout
the vehicle. “If Daimler wants to change the way a gauge looks, it has to
contact a supplier half a world away and then wait for a series of
approvals,” Javidan said. “It would take them a year to change the way the
‘P’ on the instrument panel looks. At Tesla, if Elon decides he wants a
picture of a bunny rabbit on every gauge for Easter, he can have that done in
a couple of hours.”*
As Tesla turned into a star of modern American industry, its closest
rivals were obliterated. Fisker Automotive filed for bankruptcy and was
bought by a Chinese auto parts company in 2014. One of its main investors
was Ray Lane, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
Lane had cost Kleiner Perkins a chance to invest in Tesla and then backed
Fisker—a disastrous move that tarnished the firm’s brand and Lane’s
reputation. Better Place was another start-up that enjoyed more hype than
Fisker and Tesla put together and raised close to $1 billion to build electric
cars and battery-swapping stations.18 The company never produced much of
anything and declared bankruptcy in 2013.
The guys like Straubel who had been at Tesla since the beginning are
quick to remind people that the chance to build an awesome electric car had
been there all along. “It’s not really like there was a rush to this idea, and
we got there first,” Straubel said. “It is frequently forgotten in hindsight that
people thought this was the shittiest business opportunity on the planet. The
venture capitalists were all running for the hills.” What separated Tesla
from the competition was the willingness to charge after its vision without
compromise, a complete commitment to execute to Musk’s standards.

THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY OF ELON
MUSK
THE RIVE BROTHERS USED TO BE LIKE A TECHNOLOGY GANG.
In the late 1990s, they would jump on skateboards and zip around the
streets of Santa Cruz, knocking on the doors of businesses and asking if
they needed any help managing their computing systems. The young men,
who had all grown up in South Africa with their cousin Elon Musk, soon
decided there must be an easier way to hawk their technology smarts than
going door-to-door. They wrote some software that allowed them to take
control of their clients’ systems from afar and to automate many of the
standard tasks that companies required, such as installing updates for
applications. The software became the basis of a new company called
Everdream, and the brothers promoted their technology in some compelling
ways. Billboards went up around Silicon Valley in which Lyndon Rive, a
buff underwater hockey player,* stood naked with his pants around his
ankles, while holding a computer in front of his crotch. Up above his photo,
the tagline for the ad read, “Don’t get caught with your systems down.”
By 2004, Lyndon and his brothers, Peter and Russ, wanted a new
challenge—something that not only made them money but, as Lyndon put
it, “something that made us feel good every single day.” Near the end of the
summer that year, Lyndon rented an RV and set out with Musk for the
Black Rock desert and the madness of Burning Man. The men used to go on
adventures all the time when they were kids and looked forward to the long
drive as a way to catch up and brainstorm about their businesses. Musk
knew that Lyndon and his brothers were angling for something big. While
driving, Musk turned to Lyndon and suggested that he look into the solar
energy market. Musk had studied it a bit and thought there were some
opportunities that others had missed. “He said it was a good place to get
into,” Lyndon recalled.
After arriving at Burning Man, Musk, a regular at the event, and his
family went through their standard routines. They set up camp and prepped
their art car for a drive. This year, they had cut the roof off a small car,
elevated the steering wheel, shifted it to the right so that it was placed near
the middle of the vehicle, and replaced the seats with a couch. Musk took a
lot of pleasure in driving the funky creation.19 “Elon likes to see the
rawness of people there,” said Bill Lee, his longtime friend. “It’s his version
of camping. He wants to go and drive the art cars and see installations and
the great light shows. He dances a lot.” Musk put on a display of strength
and determination at the event as well. There was a wooden pole perhaps
thirty feet high with a dancing platform at the top. Dozens of people tried
and failed to climb it, and then Musk gave it a go. “His technique was very
awkward, and he should not have succeeded,” said Lyndon. “But he hugged
it and just inched up and inched up until he reached the top.”
Musk and the Rives left Burning Man enthused. The Rives decided to
become experts on the solar industry and find the opportunity in the market.
They spent two years studying solar technology and the dynamics of the
business, reading research reports, interviewing people, and attending
conferences along the way. It was during the Solar Power International
conference that the Rive brothers really hit on what their business model
might be. Only about two thousand* people showed up for the event, and
they all fit into a couple of hotel conference rooms for presentations and
panels. During one open discussion session, representatives from a handful
of the world’s largest solar installers were sitting onstage, and the moderator
asked what they were doing to make solar panels more affordable for
consumers. “They all gave the same answer,” Lyndon said. “They said,
‘We’re waiting for the cost of the panels to drop.’ None of them were taking
ownership of the problem.”
At the time, it was not easy for consumers to get solar panels on their
houses. You had to be very proactive, acquiring the panels and finding
someone else to install them. The consumer paid up front and had to make
an educated guess as to whether or not his or her house even got enough
sunshine to make the ordeal worthwhile. On top of all this, people were
reluctant to buy panels, knowing that the next year’s models would be more
efficient.
The Rives decided to make buying into the solar proposition much
simpler and formed a company called SolarCity in 2006. Unlike other
companies, they would not manufacture their own solar panels. Instead they
would buy them and then do just about everything else in-house. They built
software for analyzing a customer’s current energy bill and the position of
their house and the amount of sunlight it typically received to determine if
solar made sense for the property. They built up their own teams to install
the solar panels. And they created a financing system in which the customer
did not need to pay anything up front for the panels. The consumer leased
the panels over a number of years at a fixed monthly rate. Consumers got a
lower bill overall, they were no longer subject to the constantly rising rates
of typical utilities, and, if they sold their house, they could pass the contract
to the new owner. At the end of the lease, the homeowner could also
upgrade to new, more efficient panels. Musk had helped his cousins come
up with this structure and become the company’s chairman and its largest
shareholder, owning about a third of SolarCity.
Six years later, SolarCity had become the largest installer of solar panels
in the country. The company had lived up to its initial goals and made
installing the panels painless. Rivals were rushing to mimic its business
model. SolarCity had benefited along the way from a collapse in the price
of solar panels, which occurred after Chinese panel manufacturers flooded
the market with product. It had also expanded its business from consumers
to businesses with companies like Intel, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart signing
up for large installations. In 2012, SolarCity went public and its shares
soared higher in the months that followed. By 2014, SolarCity was valued
at close to $7 billion.
During the entire period of SolarCity’s growth, Silicon Valley had
dumped huge amounts of money into green technology companies with
mostly disastrous results. There were the automotive flubs like Fisker and
Better Place, and Solyndra, the solar cell maker that conservatives loved to
hold up as a cautionary tale of government spending and cronyism run
amok. Some of the most famous venture capitalists in history, like John
Doerr and Vinod Khosla, were ripped apart by the local and national press
for their failed green investments. The story was almost always the same.
People had thrown money at green technology because it seemed like the
right thing to do, not because it made business sense. From new kinds of
energy storage systems to electric cars and solar panels, the technology
never quite lived up to its billing and required too much government
funding and too many incentives to create a viable market. Much of this
criticism was fair. It’s just that there was this Elon Musk guy hanging
around who seemed to have figured something out that everyone else had
missed. “We had a blanket rule against investing in clean-tech companies
for about a decade,” said Peter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder and venture
capitalist at Founders Fund. “On the macro level, we were right because
clean tech as a sector was quite bad. But on the micro level, it looks like
Elon has the two most successful clean-tech companies in the U.S. We
would rather explain his success as being a fluke. There’s the whole Iron
Man thing in which he’s presented as a cartoonish businessman—this very
unusual animal at the zoo. But there is now a degree to which you have to
ask whether his success is an indictment on the rest of us who have been
working on much more incremental things. To the extent that the world still
doubts Elon, I think it’s a reflection on the insanity of the world and not on
the supposed insanity of Elon.”
SolarCity, like the rest of Musk’s ventures, did not represent a business
opportunity so much as it represented a worldview. Musk had decided long
ago—in his very rational manner—that solar made sense. Enough solar
energy hits the Earth’s surface in about an hour to equal a year’s worth of
worldwide energy consumption from all sources put together.20
Improvements in the efficiency of solar panels have been happening at a
steady clip. If solar is destined to be mankind’s preferred energy source in
the future, then this future ought to be brought about as quickly as possible.
Starting in 2014, SolarCity began to make the full extent of its
ambitions more obvious. First, the company began selling energy storage
systems. These units were built through a partnership with Tesla Motors.
Battery packs were manufactured at the Tesla factory and stacked inside
refrigerator-sized metal cases. Businesses and consumers could purchase
these storage systems to augment their solar panel arrays. Once they were
charged up, the battery units could be used to help large customers get
through the night or during unexpected outages. Customers could also pull
from the batteries instead of the grid during peak energy use periods, when
utilities tend to tack on extra charges. While SolarCity rolled the storage
units out in a modest, experimental fashion, the company expects most of
its customers to buy the systems in the years ahead to smooth out the solar
experience and help people and businesses leave the electrical grid
altogether.
Then, in June 2014, SolarCity acquired a solar cell maker called Silevo
for $200 million. This deal marked a huge shift in strategy. SolarCity would
no longer buy its solar panels. It would make them at a factory in New York
State. Silevo’s cells were said to be 18.5 percent efficient at turning light
into energy, compared to 14.5 percent for most cells, and the expectations
were that the company could reach 24 percent efficiency with the right
manufacturing techniques. Buying, rather than manufacturing, solar panels
had been one of SolarCity’s great advantages. It could capitalize on the glut
in the solar cell market and avoid the large capital expenditures tied to
building and running factories. With 110,000 customers, however, SolarCity
had started to consume so many solar panels that it needed to ensure a
consistent supply and price. “We are currently installing more solar than
most of the companies are manufacturing,” said Peter Rive, the cofounder
and chief technology officer at SolarCity. “If we do the manufacturing
ourselves and take advantage of some different technology, our costs will be
lower—and this business has always been about lowering the costs.”
After adding the leases, the storage units, and the solar cell
manufacturing together, it became clear to close observers of SolarCity that
the company had morphed into something resembling a utility. It had built
out a network of solar systems all under its control and managed by the
company’s software. By the end of 2015, SolarCity expects to have
installed 2 gigawatts’ worth of solar panels, producing 2.8 terawatt-hours of
electricity per year. “This would put us on a path to fulfill our goal to
become one of the largest suppliers of electricity in the United States,” the
company said after announcing these figures in a quarterly earnings
statement. The reality is that SolarCity accounts for a tiny fraction of the
United States’ annual energy consumption and has a long way to go to
become a major supplier of electricity in the country. There can, however,
be little doubt that Musk intends for the company to be a dominant force in
the solar industry and in the energy industry overall.
What’s more, SolarCity is a key part of what can be thought of as the
unified field theory of Musk. Each one of his businesses is interconnected
in the short term and the long term. Tesla makes battery packs that
SolarCity can then sell to end customers. SolarCity supplies Tesla’s
charging stations with solar panels, helping Tesla to provide free recharging
to its drivers. Newly minted Model S owners regularly opt to begin living
the Musk Lifestyle and outfit their homes with solar panels. Tesla and
SpaceX help each other as well. They exchange knowledge around
materials, manufacturing techniques, and the intricacies of operating
factories that build so much stuff from the ground up.
For most of their histories, SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX have been the
clear underdogs in their respective markets and gone to war against deeppocketed,
entrenched competitors. The solar, automotive, and aerospace
industries remain larded down by regulation and bureaucracy, which favors
incumbents. To people in these industries Musk came off as a wide-eyed
technologist who could be easily dismissed and ridiculed and who, as a
competitor, fell somewhere on the spectrum between annoying and full of
shit. The incumbents did their usual thing using their connections in
Washington to make life as miserable as possible on all three of Musk’s
companies, and they were pretty good at it.
As of 2012, Musk Co. turned into a real threat, and it became harder to
go at SolarCity, Tesla, or SpaceX as individual companies. Musk’s star
power had surged and washed over all three ventures at the same time.
When Tesla’s shares jumped, quite often SolarCity’s did, too. Similar
optimistic feelings accompanied successful SpaceX launches. They proved
Musk knew how to accomplish the most difficult of things, and investors
seemed to buy in more to the risks Musk took with his other enterprises.
The executives and lobbyists of aerospace, energy, and automotive
companies were suddenly going up against a rising star of big business—an
industrialist celebrity. Some of Musk’s opponents started to fear being on
the wrong side of history or at least the wrong side of his glow. Others
began playing really dirty.
Musk has spent years buttering up the Democrats. He’s visited the
White House several times and has the ear of President Obama. Musk,
however, is not a blind loyalist. He first and foremost backs the beliefs
behind Musk Co. and then uses any pragmatic means at his disposal to
advance his cause. Musk plays the part of the ruthless industrialist with a
fierce capitalist streak better than most Republicans and has the credentials
to back it up and earn support. The politicians in states like Alabama
looking to protect some factory jobs for Lockheed or in New Jersey trying
to help out the automobile dealership lobby now have to contend with a guy
who has an employment and manufacturing empire spread across the entire
United States. As of this writing, SpaceX had a factory in Los Angeles, a
rocket test facility in central Texas, and had just started construction on a
spaceport in South Texas. (SpaceX does a lot of business at existing launch
sites in California and Florida, as well.) Tesla had its car factory in Silicon
Valley, the design center in Los Angeles, and had started construction on a
battery factory in Nevada. (Politicians from Nevada, Texas, California, New
Mexico, and Arizona threw themselves at Musk over the battery factory,
with Nevada ultimately winning the business by offering Tesla $1.4 billion
in incentives. This event confirmed not only Musk’s soaring celebrity but
also his unmatched ability to raise funds.) SolarCity has created thousands
of white- and blue-collar clean-tech jobs, and it will create manufacturing
jobs at the solar panel factory that’s being built in Buffalo, New York. All
together, Musk Co. employed about fifteen thousand people at the end of
2014. Far from stopping there, the plan for Musk Co. calls for tens of
thousands of more jobs to be created on the back of ever more ambitious
products.
Tesla’s primary focus throughout 2015 will be bringing the Model X to
market. Musk expects the SUV to sell at least as well as the Model S and
wants Tesla’s factories to be capable of making 100,000 cars per year by the
end of 2015 to keep up with demand for both vehicles. The major downside
accompanying the Model X is its price. The SUV will start at the same lofty
prices as the Model S, which limits the potential customer base. The hope,
though, is that the Model X turns into the luxury vehicle of choice for
families and solidifies the Tesla brand’s connection with women. Musk has
pledged that the Supercharger network, service centers, and the batteryswap
stations will be built out even more in 2015 to greet the arrival of the
new vehicle. Beyond the Model X, Tesla has started work on the second
version of the Roadster, talked about making a truck, and, in all seriousness,
has begun modeling a type of submarine car that could transition from road
to water. Musk paid $1 million for the Lotus Esprit that Roger Moore drove
underwater in The Spy Who Loved Me and wants to prove that such a
vehicle can be done. “Maybe we’ll make two or three, but it wouldn’t be
more than that,” Musk told the Independent newspaper. “I think the market
for submarine cars is quite small.”
At the opposite end of the sales spectrum, or so Musk hopes, will be
Tesla’s third-generation car, or the Model 3. Due out in 2017, this four-door
car would come in around $35,000 and be the real measure of Tesla’s
impact on the world. The company hopes to sell hundreds of thousands of
the Model 3 and make electric cars truly mainstream. For comparison,
BMW sells about 300,000 Minis and 500,000 of its BMW 3 Series vehicles
per year. Tesla would look to match those figures. “I think Tesla is going to
make a lot of cars,” Musk said. “If we continue on the current growth rate, I
think Tesla will be one of the most valuable companies in the world.”
Tesla already consumes a huge portion of the world’s lithium ion battery
supply and will need far more batteries to produce the Model 3. This is why,
in 2014, Musk announced plans to build what he dubbed the Gigafactory, or
the world’s largest lithium ion manufacturing facility. Each Gigafactory will
employ about 6,500 people and help Tesla meet a variety of goals. It should
first allow Tesla to keep up with the battery demand created by its cars and
the storage units sold by SolarCity. Tesla also expects to be able to lower
the costs of its batteries while improving their energy density. It will build
the Gigafactory in conjunction with longtime battery partner Panasonic, but
it will be Tesla that is running the factory and fine-tuning its operations.
According to Straubel, the battery packs coming out of the Gigafactory
should be dramatically cheaper and better than the ones built today,
allowing Tesla not only to hit the $35,000 price target for the Model 3 but
also to pave the way for electric vehicles with 500-plus miles of range.
If Tesla actually can deliver an affordable car with 500 miles of range, it
will have built what many people in the auto industry insisted for years was
impossible. To do that while also constructing a worldwide network of free
charging stations, revamping the way cars are sold, and revolutionizing
automotive technology would be an exceptional feat in the history of
capitalism.
In early 2014, Tesla raised $2 billion by selling bonds. Tesla’s ability to
raise money from eager investors was a newfound luxury. Tesla had
bordered on bankruptcy for much of its existence and been one major
technical gaffe from obsolescence at all times. The money coupled with
Tesla’s still-rising share price and strong sales has put the company in a
position to open lots of new stores and service centers while advancing its
manufacturing capabilities. “We don’t necessarily need all of the money for
the Gigafactory right now, but I decided to raise it in advance because you
never know when there will be some bloody meltdown,” Musk said. “There
could be external factors or there could be some unexpected recall and then
suddenly we need to raise money on top of dealing with that. I feel a bit like
my grandmother. She lived through the Great Depression and some real
hard times. Once you’ve been through that, it stays with you for a long
time. I’m not sure it ever leaves really. So, I do feel joy now, but there’s still
that nagging feeling that it might all go away. Even later in life when my
grandmother knew there was really no possibility of her going hungry, she
always had this thing about food. With Tesla, I decided to raise a huge
amount of money just in case something terrible happens.”
Musk felt optimistic enough about Tesla’s future to talk to me about
some of his more whimsical plans. He hopes to redesign the Tesla
headquarters in Palo Alto, a change employees would welcome. The
building, with its tiny, 1980s-era lobby and a kitchen that can barely handle
a few people making cereal21 at the same time, has none of the perks of a
typical Silicon Valley darling. “I think our Tesla headquarters looks like
crap,” Musk said. “We’re going to spruce things up. Not to sort of the
Google level. You have to be like making money hand over fist in order to
be able to spend money the way that Google does. But we’re going to make
our headquarters much nicer and put in a restaurant.” Naturally, Musk had
ideas for some mechanical enhancements as well. “Everybody around here
has slides in their lobbies,” he said. “I’m actually wondering about putting
in a roller coaster—like a functional roller coaster at the factory in Fremont.
You’d get in, and it would take you around factory but also up and down.
Who else has a roller coaster? I’m thinking about doing that with SpaceX,
too. That one might be even bigger since SpaceX has like ten buildings
now. It would probably be really expensive, but I like the idea of it.”
What’s fascinating is that Musk remains willing to lose it all. He doesn’t
want to build just one Gigafactory but several. And he needs these facilities
to be built quickly and flawlessly, so that they’re cranking out massive
quantities of batteries right as the Model 3 arrives. If need be, Musk will
build a second Gigafactory to compete with the Nevada site and place his
own employees in competition with each other in a race to make the
batteries first. “We’re not really trying to sort of yank anyone’s chain here,”
Musk said. “It’s just like this thing needs to be completed on time. If we
suddenly find that we’re leveling the ground and laying the foundation and
we’re on a bloody Indian burial ground, then fuck. We can’t say, ‘Oh shit.
Let’s go back to the other place that we were thinking about and get a sixmonth
reset.’ Six months for this factory is a huge deal. Do the basic math
and it’s more than a billion dollars a month in lost revenue,* assuming we
use it to capacity. From a different standpoint, if we spend all the money to
prepare the car factory in Fremont to triple the volume from 150,000 per
year to 450,000 or 500,000 cars and hire and train all the people, and we’re
just sitting there waiting for the factory to come on line, we’d be burning
money like it was going out of fashion. I think that could kill the company.
“A six-month offset would be like, like Gallipoli. You have to make
sure you charge right after the bombardment. Don’t fucking sit around for
two hours so that the Turks can go back in the trenches. Timing is
important. We have to do everything we can to minimize the timing risk.”
What Musk struggles to fathom is why other automakers with deeper
pockets aren’t making similar moves. At a minimum, Tesla seems to have
influenced consumers and the auto industry enough for there to be an
expected surge in demand for electric vehicles. “I think we have moved the
needle for almost every car company,” Musk said. “Just the twenty-two
thousand cars we sold in 2013 had a highly leveraged effect in pushing the
industry toward sustainable technology.” It’s true that the supply for lithium
ion batteries is already constrained, and Tesla looks like the only company
addressing the problem in a meaningful way.
“The competitors are all sort of pooh-poohing the Gigafactory,” Musk
said. “They think it’s a stupid idea, that the battery supplier should just go
build something like that. But I know all the suppliers, and I can tell you
that they don’t like the idea of spending several billion dollars on a battery
factory. You’ve got a chicken-and-egg problem where the car companies are
not going to commit to a giant volume because they’re not sure you can sell
enough electric cars. So, I know we can’t get enough lithium ion batteries
unless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is building this
thing.”
There’s the potential that Tesla is setting itself up to capitalize on a
situation like the one Apple found itself in when it first introduced the
iPhone. Apple’s rivals spent the initial year after the iPhone’s release
dismissing the product. Once it became clear Apple had a hit, the
competitors had to catch up. Even with the device right in their hands, it
took companies like HTC and Samsung years to produce anything
comparable. Other once-great companies like Nokia and BlackBerry didn’t
withstand the shock. If, and it’s a big if, Tesla’s Model 3 turned into a
massive hit—the thing that everyone with enough money wanted because
buying something else would just be paying for the past—then the rival
automakers would be in a terrible bind. Most of the car companies dabbling
in electric vehicles continue to buy bulky, off-the-shelf batteries rather than
developing their own technology. No matter how much they wanted to
respond to the Model 3, the automakers would need years to come up with a
real challenger and even then they might not have a ready supply of
batteries for their vehicles.
“I think it is going to be a bit like that,” Musk said. “When will the first
non-Tesla Gigafactory get built? Probably no sooner than six years from
now. The big car companies are so derivative. They want to see it work
somewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward.
They’re probably more like seven years away. But I hope I’m wrong.”
Musk speaks about the cars, solar panels, and batteries with such
passion that it’s easy to forget they are more or less sideline projects. He
believes in the technologies to the extent that he thinks they’re the right
things to pursue for the betterment of mankind. They’ve also brought him
fame and fortune. Musk’s ultimate goal, though, remains turning humans
into an interplanetary species. This may sound silly to some, but there can
be no doubt that this is Musk’s raison d’être. Musk has decided that man’s
survival depends on setting up another colony on another planet and that he
should dedicate his life to making this happen.
Musk is now quite rich on paper. He was worth about $10 billion at the
time of this writing. When he started SpaceX more than a decade ago,
however, he had far less capital at his disposal. He didn’t have the fuck-you
money of a Jeff Bezos, who handed his space company Blue Origin a
kingly pile of cash and asked it to make Bezos’s dreams come true. If Musk
wanted to get to Mars, he would have to earn it by building SpaceX into a
real business. This all seems to have worked in Musk’s favor. SpaceX has
learned to make cheap and effective rockets and to push the limits of
aerospace technology.
In the near term, SpaceX will begin testing its ability to take people into
space. It wants to perform a manned test flight by 2016 and to fly astronauts
to the International Space Station for NASA the next year. The company
will also likely make a major move into building and selling satellites,
which would mark an expansion into one of the most lucrative parts of the
aerospace business. Along with these efforts, SpaceX has been testing the
Falcon Heavy—its giant rocket capable of flying the biggest payloads in the
world—and its reusable-rocket technology. In early 2015, SpaceX almost
managed to land the first stage of its rocket on a platform in the ocean.
Once it succeeds, it will begin performing tests on land.
In 2014, SpaceX also began construction on its own spaceport in South
Texas. It has acquired dozens of acres where it plans to construct a modern
rocket launch facility unlike anything the world has seen. Musk wants to
automate a great deal of the launch process, so that the rockets can be
refueled, stood up, and fired on their own with computers handling the
safety procedures. SpaceX wants to fly rockets several times a month for its
business, and having its own spaceport should help speed up such
capabilities. Getting to Mars will require an even more impressive set of
skills and technology.
“We need to figure out how to launch multiple times a day,” Musk said.
“The thing that’s important in the long run is establishing a self-sustaining
base on Mars. In order for that to work—in order to have a self-sustaining
city on Mars—there would need to be millions of tons of equipment and
probably millions of people. So how many launches is that? Well, if you
send up 100 people at a time, which is a lot to go on such a long journey,
you’d need to do 10,000 flights to get to a million people. So 10,000 flights
over what period of time? Given that you can only really depart for Mars
once every two years, that means you would need like forty or fifty years.
“And then I think for each flight that departs to Mars you want to sort of
launch the spacecraft into orbit and then have it be in a parking orbit and
refuel its tanks with propellant. Essentially, the spacecraft would use a
bunch of its propellant to get to orbit, but then you send up a tanker
spacecraft to fill up the propellant tanks of the spacecraft so that it can
depart for Mars at high speed and can do so and get there in three months
instead of six months and with a large payload. I don’t have a detailed plan
for Mars but I know of something at least that would work, which is sort of
this all-methane system with a big booster, a spacecraft, and a tanker
potentially. I think SpaceX will have developed a booster and spaceship in
the 2025 time frame capable of taking large quantities of people and cargo
to Mars.
“The thing that’s important is to reach an economic threshold around the
cost per person for a trip to Mars. If it costs $1 billion per person, there will
be no Mars colony. At around $1 million or $500,000 per person, I think it’s
highly likely that there will be a self-sustaining Martian colony. There will
be enough people interested who will sell their stuff on Earth and move. It’s
not about tourism. It’s like people coming to America back in the New
World days. You move, get a job there, and make things work. If you solve
the transport problem, it’s not that hard to make a pressurized transparent
greenhouse to live in. But if you can’t get there in the first place, it doesn’t
matter.
“Eventually, you’d need to heat Mars up if you want it to be an
Earthlike planet, and I don’t have a plan for that. That would take a long
time in the best of circumstances. It would probably take, I don’t know,
somewhere between a century and a millennium. There’s zero chance of it
being terraformed and Earthlike in my lifetime. Not zero, but 0.001 percent
chance, and you would have to take real drastic measures with Mars.”*
Musk spent months pacing around his home in Los Angeles late at night
thinking about these plans for Mars and bouncing them off Riley, whom he
remarried near the end of 2012.* “I mean, there aren’t that many people you
can talk to about this sort of thing,” Musk said. These chats included Musk
daydreaming aloud about becoming the first man to set foot on the Red
Planet. “He definitely wants to be the first man on Mars,” Riley said. “I
have begged him not to be.” Perhaps Musk enjoys teasing his wife or
maybe he’s playing coy, but he denied this ambition during one of our latenight
chats. “I would only be on the first trip to Mars if I was confident that
SpaceX would be fine if I die,” he said. “I’d like to go, but I don’t have to
go. The point is not about me visiting Mars but about enabling large
numbers of people to go to the planet.” Musk may not even go into space.
He does not plan to participate in SpaceX’s upcoming human test flights. “I
don’t think that would be wise,” he said. “It would be like the head of
Boeing being a test pilot for a new plane. It’s not the right thing for SpaceX
or the future of space exploration. I might be on there if it’s been flying for
three or four years. Honestly, if I never go to space, that will be okay. The
point is to maximize the probable life span of humanity.”
It’s difficult to gauge just how seriously the average person takes Musk
when he talks like this. A few years ago, most people would have lumped
him into the category of people who hype up jet packs and robots and
whatever else Silicon Valley decided to fixate on for the moment. Then
Musk filed away one accomplishment after another, transforming himself
from big talker to one of Silicon Valley’s most revered doers. Thiel has
watched Musk go through this maturation—from the driven but insecure
CEO of PayPal to a confident CEO who commands the respect of
thousands. “I think there are ways he has dramatically improved over time,”
said Thiel. Most impressive to Thiel has been Musk’s ability to find bright,
ambitious people and lure them to his companies. “He has the most talented
people in the aerospace industry working for him, and the same case can be
made for Tesla, where, if you’re a talented mechanical engineer who likes
building cars, then you’re going to Tesla because it’s probably the only
company in the U.S. where you can do interesting new things. Both
companies were designed with this vision of motivating a critical mass of
talented people to work on inspiring things.” Thiel thinks Musk’s goal of
getting humans to Mars should be taken seriously and believes it gives the
public hope. Not everyone will identify with the mission but the fact that
there’s someone out there pushing exploration and our technical abilities to
their limits is important. “The goal of sending a man to Mars is so much
more inspiring than what other people are trying to do in space,” Thiel said.
“It’s this going-back-to-the-future idea. There’s been this long wind-down
of the space program, and people have abandoned the optimistic visions of
the future that we had in the early 1970s. SpaceX shows there is a way
toward bringing back that future. There’s great value in what Elon is
doing.”
The true believers came out in full force in August 2013 when Musk
unveiled something called the Hyperloop. Billed as a new mode of
transportation, this machine was a large-scale pneumatic tube like the ones
used to send mail around offices. Musk proposed linking cities like Los
Angeles and San Francisco via an elevated version of this kind of tube that
would transport people and cars in pods. Similar ideas had been proposed
before, but Musk’s creation had some unique elements. He called for the
tube to run under low pressure and for the pods to float on a bed of air
produced by skis at their base. Each pod would be thrust forward by an
electromagnetic pulse, and motors placed throughout the tube would give
the pods added boosts as needed. These mechanisms could keep the pods
going at 800 mph, allowing someone to travel from Los Angeles to San
Francisco in about thirty minutes. The whole thing would, of course, be
solar-powered and aimed at linking cities less than a thousand miles apart.
“It makes sense for things like L.A. to San Francisco, New York to D.C.,
New York to Boston,” Musk said at the time. “Over one thousand miles, the
tube cost starts to become prohibitive, and you don’t want tubes every
which way. You don’t want to live in Tube Land.”
Musk had been thinking about the Hyperloop for a number of months,
describing it to friends in private. The first time he talked about it to anyone
outside of his inner circle was during one of our interviews. Musk told me
that the idea originated out of his hatred for California’s proposed highspeed
rail system. “The sixty-billion-dollar bullet train they’re proposing in
California would be the slowest bullet train in the world at the highest cost
per mile,” Musk said. “They’re going for records in all the wrong ways.”
California’s high-speed rail is meant to allow people to go from Los
Angeles to San Francisco in about two and a half hours upon its completion
in—wait for it—2029. It takes about an hour to fly between the cities today
and five hours to drive, placing the train right in the zone of mediocrity,
which particularly gnawed at Musk. He insisted the Hyperloop would cost
about $6 billion to $10 billion, go faster than a plane, and let people drive
their cars onto a pod and drive out into a new city.
At the time, it seemed that Musk had dished out the Hyperloop proposal
just to make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train. He
didn’t actually intend to build the thing. It was more that he wanted to show
people that more creative ideas were out there for things that might actually
solve problems and push the state forward. With any luck, the high-speed
rail would be canceled. Musk said as much to me during a series of e-mails
and phone calls leading up to the announcement. “Down the road, I might
fund or advise on a Hyperloop project, but right now I can’t take my eye off
the ball at either SpaceX or Tesla,” he wrote.
Musk’s tune, however, started to change after he released the paper
detailing the Hyperloop. Bloomberg Businessweek had the first story on it,
and the magazine’s Web server began melting down as people stormed the
website to read about the invention. Twitter went nuts as well. About an
hour after Musk released the information, he held a conference call to talk
about the Hyperloop, and somewhere in between our numerous earlier chats
and that moment, he’d decided to build the thing, telling reporters that he
would consider making at least a prototype to prove that the technology
could work. Some people had their fun with all of this. “Billionaire unveils
imaginary space train,” teased Valleywag. “We love Elon Musk’s nutso
determination—there was certainly a time when electric cars and private
space flight seemed silly, too. But what’s sillier is treating this as anything
other than a very rich man’s wild imagination.” Unlike its early Teslabashing
days, Valleywag was now the minority voice. People seemed
mainly to believe Musk could do it. The depth to which people believed it, I
think, surprised Musk and forced him to commit to the prototype. In a weird
life-imitating-art moment, Musk really had become the closest thing the
world had to Tony Stark, and he could not let his adoring public down.
Shortly after the release of the Hyperloop plans, Shervin Pishevar, an
investor and friend of Musk’s, brought the detailed specifications for the
technology with him during a ninety-minute meeting with President Obama
at the White House. “The president fell in love with the idea,” Pishevar
said. The president’s staff studied the documents and arranged a one-on-one
with Musk and Obama in April 2014. Since then, Pishevar, Kevin Brogan,
and others, have formed a company called Hyperloop Technologies Inc.
with the hopes of building the first leg of the Hyperloop between Los
Angeles and Las Vegas. In theory, people would be able to hop between the
two cities in about ten minutes. Nevada senator Harry Reid has been briefed
on the idea as well, and efforts are under way to buy the land rights
alongside Interstate 15 that would make the high-speed transport possible.
For employees like Gwynne Shotwell and J. B. Straubel, working with
Musk means helping develop these sorts of wonderful technologies in
relative obscurity. They’re the steady hands that will forever be expected to
stay in the shadows. Shotwell has been a consistent presence at SpaceX
almost since day one, pushing the company forward and suppressing her
ego to ensure that Musk gets all the attention he desires. If you’re Shotwell
and truly believe in the cause of sending people to Mars, then the mission
takes precedence over personal desires. Straubel, likewise, has been the
constant at Tesla—a go-between whom other employees could rely on to
carry messages to Musk, and the guy who knows everything about the cars.
Despite his stature at the company, Straubel was one of several longtime
employees who confessed they were nervous to speak with me on the
record. Musk likes to be the guy talking on his companies’ behalf and
comes down hard on even his most loyal executives if they say something
deemed to be out of line with Musk’s views or with what he wants the
public to think. Straubel has dedicated himself to making electric cars and
didn’t want some dumb reporter wrecking his life’s work. “I try really hard
to back away and put my ego aside,” Straubel said. “Elon is incredibly
difficult to work for, but it’s mostly because he’s so passionate. He can be
impatient and say, ‘God damn it! This is what we have to do!’ and some
people will get shell-shocked and catatonic. It seems like people can get
afraid of him and paralyzed in a weird way. I try to help everyone to
understand what his goals and visions are, and then I have a bunch of my
own goals, too, and make sure we’re in synch. Then, I try and go back and
make sure the company is aligned. Ultimately, Elon is the boss. He has
driven this thing with his blood, sweat, and tears. He has risked more than
anyone else. I respect the hell out of what he has done. It just could not
work without Elon. In my view, he has earned the right to be the front
person for this thing.”
The rank-and-file employees tend to describe Musk in more mixed
ways. They revere his drive and respect how demanding he can be. They
also think he can be hard to the point of mean and come off as capricious.
The employees want to be close to Musk, but they also fear that he’ll
suddenly change his mind about something and that every interaction with
him is an opportunity to be fired. “Elon’s worst trait by far, in my opinion,
is a complete lack of loyalty or human connection,” said one former
employee. “Many of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed
to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought. Maybe it was
calculated to keep the rest of the workforce on their toes and scared; maybe
he was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable degree.
What was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition:
used for a specific purpose until exhausted and discarded.”
The communications departments of SpaceX and Tesla have witnessed
the latter forms of behavior more than any other group of employees. Musk
has burned through public relations staffers with comical efficiency. He
tends to take on a lot of the communications work himself, writing news
releases and contacting the press as he sees fit. Quite often, Musk does not
let his communications staff in on his agenda. Ahead of the Hyperloop
announcement, for example, his representatives were sending me e-mails to
find out the time and date for the press conference. On other occasions,
reporters have received an alert about a teleconference with Musk just
minutes before it started. This was not a function of the PR people being
incompetent in getting word of the event out. The truth was that Musk had
only let them know about his plans a couple of minutes in advance, and
they were scrambling to catch up to his whims. When Musk does delegate
work to the communications staff, they’re expected to jump in without
missing a beat and to execute at the highest level. Some of this staff,
operating under this mix of pressure and surprise, only lasted between a few
weeks and a few months. A few others have hung on for a couple of years
before burning out or being fired.
The granddaddy example of Musk’s seemingly callous interoffice style
occurred in early 2014 when he fired Mary Beth Brown. To describe her as
a loyal executive assistant would be grossly inadequate. Brown often felt
like an extension of Musk—the one being who crossed over into all of his
worlds. For more than a decade, she gave up her life for Musk, traipsing
back and forth between Los Angeles and Silicon Valley every week, while
working late into the night and on weekends. Brown went to Musk and
asked that she be compensated on par with SpaceX’s top executives, since
she was handling so much of Musk’s scheduling across two companies,
doing public relations work and often making business decisions. Musk
replied that Brown should take a couple of weeks off, and he would take on
her duties and gauge how hard they were. When Brown returned, Musk let
her know that he didn’t need her anymore, and he asked Shotwell’s assistant
to begin scheduling his meetings. Brown, still loyal and hurt, didn’t want to
discuss any of this with me. Musk said that she had become too comfortable
speaking on his behalf and that, frankly, she needed a life. Other people
grumbled that Brown and Riley clashed and that this was the root cause of
Brown’s ouster.* (Brown declined to be interviewed for this book, despite
several requests.)
Whatever the case, the optics of the situation were terrible. Tony Stark
doesn’t fire Pepper Potts. He adores her and takes care of her for life. She’s
the only person he can really trust—the one who has been there through
everything. That Musk was willing to let Brown go and in such an
unceremonious fashion struck people inside SpaceX and Tesla as
scandalous and as the ultimate confirmation of his cruel stoicism. The tale
of Brown’s departure became part of the lore around Musk’s lack of
empathy. It got bundled up into the stories of Musk dressing employees
down in legendary fashion with vicious barb after vicious barb. People also
linked this type of behavior to Musk’s other quirky traits. He’s been known
to obsess over typos in e-mails to the point that he could not see past the
errors and read the actual content of the messages. Even in social settings,
Musk might get up from the dinner table without a word of explanation to
head outside and look at the stars, simply because he’s not willing to suffer
fools or small talk. After adding up this behavior, dozens of people
expressed to me their conclusion that Musk sits somewhere on the autism
spectrum and that he has trouble considering other people’s emotions and
caring about their well-being.
There’s a tendency, especially in Silicon Valley, to label people who are
a bit different or quirky as autistic or afflicted with Asperger’s syndrome.
It’s armchair psychology for conditions that can be inherently funky to
diagnose or even codify. To slap this label on Musk feels ill-informed and
too easy.
Musk acts differently with his closest friends and family than he does
with employees, even those who have worked alongside him for a long
time. Among his inner circle, Musk is warm, funny, and deeply emotional.*
He might not engage in the standard chitchat, asking a friend how his kids
are doing, but he would do everything in his considerable power to help that
friend if his child were sick or in trouble. He will protect those close to him
at all costs and, when deemed necessary, seek to destroy those who have
wronged him or his friends.
Musk’s behavior matches up much more closely with someone who is
described by neuropsychologists as profoundly gifted. These are people
who in childhood exhibit exceptional intellectual depth and max out IQ
tests. It’s not uncommon for these children to look out into the world and
find flaws—glitches in the system—and construct logical paths in their
minds to fix them. For Musk, the call to ensure that mankind is a
multiplanetary species partly stems from a life richly influenced by science
fiction and technology. Equally it’s a moral imperative that dates back to his
childhood. In some form, this has forever been his mandate.
Each facet of Musk’s life might be an attempt to soothe a type of
existential depression that seems to gnaw at his every fiber. He sees man as
self-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The people who
suggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in
the way of all of this and slowing Musk down. He does not dislike them as
people. It’s more that he feels pained by their mistakes, which have
consigned man to peril that much longer. The perceived lack of emotion is a
symptom of Musk sometimes feeling like he’s the only one who really
grasps the urgency of his mission. He’s less sensitive and less tolerant than
other people because the stakes are so high. Employees need to help solve
the problems to the absolute best of their ability or they need to get out of
the way.
Musk has been pretty up front about these tendencies. He’s implored
people to understand that he’s not chasing momentary opportunities in the
business world. He’s trying to solve problems that have been consuming
him for decades. During our conversations, Musk went back to this very
point over and over again, making sure to emphasize just how long he’d
thought about electric cars and space. The same patterns are visible in his
actions as well. When Musk announced in 2014 that Tesla would opensource
all of its patents, analysts tried to decide whether this was a publicity
stunt or if it hid an ulterior motive or a catch. But the decision was a
straightforward one for Musk. He wants people to make and buy electric
cars. Man’s future, as he sees it, depends on this. If open-sourcing Tesla’s
patents means other companies can build electric cars more easily, then that
is good for mankind, and the ideas should be free. The cynic will scoff at
this, and understandably so. Musk, however, has been programmed to
behave this way and tends to be sincere when explaining his thinking—
almost to a fault.
The people who get closest to Musk are the ones who learn to relate to
this mode of thinking.22 They’re the ones who can identify with his vision
yet challenge him intellectually to complete it. When he asked me during
one of our dinners if I thought he was insane, it was a test of sorts. We had
talked enough that he knew I was interested in what he was doing. He had
started to trust me and open up but wanted to make sure—one final time—
that I truly grasped the importance of his quest. Many of his closest friends
have passed much grander, more demanding tests. They’ve invested in his
companies. They’ve defended him against critics. They helped him keep the
wolves at bay during 2008. They’ve proven their loyalty and their
commitment to his cause.
People in the technology industry have tended to liken Musk’s drive and
the scope of his ambition to that of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. “Elon has that
deep appreciation for technology, the no-holds-barred attitude of a
visionary, and that determination to go after long-term things that they both
had,” said Edward Jung, a child prodigy who worked for Jobs and Gates
and ended up as Microsoft’s chief software architect. “And he has that
consumer sensibility of Steve along with the ability to hire good people
outside of his own comfort areas that’s more like Bill. You almost wish that
Bill and Steve had a genetically engineered love child and, who knows,
maybe we should genotype Elon to see if that’s what happened.” Steve
Jurvetson, the venture capitalist who has invested in SpaceX, Tesla, and
SolarCity, worked for Jobs, and knows Gates well, also described Musk as
an upgraded mix of the two. “Like Jobs, Elon does not tolerate C or D
players,” said Jurvetson. “But I’d say he’s nicer than Jobs and a bit more
refined than Bill Gates.”*
But the more you know about Musk, the harder it becomes to place him
among his peers. Jobs is another CEO who ran two, large industry-changing
companies—Apple and Pixar. But that’s where the practical similarities
between the two men end. Jobs dedicated far more of his energy to Apple
than Pixar, unlike Musk, who has poured equal energy into both companies,
while saving whatever was left over for SolarCity. Jobs was also legendary
for his attention to detail. No one, however, would suggest that his reach
extended down as far as Musk’s into overseeing so much of the companies’
day-to-day operations. Musk’s approach has its limitations. He’s less artful
with marketing and media strategy. Musk does not rehearse his
presentations or polish speeches. He wings most of the announcements
from Tesla and SpaceX. He’ll also fire off some major bit of news on a
Friday afternoon when it’s likely to get lost as reporters head home for the
weekend, simply because that’s when he finished writing the press release
or wanted to move on to something else. Jobs, by contrast, treated every
presentation and media moment as precious. Musk simply does not have the
luxury to work that way. “I don’t have days to practice,” he said. “I’ve got
to give impromptu talks, and the results may vary.”
As for whether Musk is leading the technology industry to new heights
like Gates and Jobs, the professional pundits remain mixed. One camp
holds that SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX offer little in the way of real hope
for an industry that could use some blockbuster innovations. For the other
camp, Musk is the real deal and the brightest shining star of what they see
as a coming revolution in technology.
The economist Tyler Cowen—who has earned some measure of fame in
recent years for his insightful writings about the state of the technology
industry and his ideas on where it may go—falls into that first camp. In The
Great Stagnation, Cowen bemoaned the lack of big technological advances
and argued that the American economy has slowed and wages have been
depressed as a result. “In a figurative sense, the American economy has
enjoyed lots of low-hanging fruit since at least the seventeenth century,
whether it be free land, lots of immigrant labor, or powerful new
technologies,” he wrote. “Yet during the last forty years, that low-hanging
fruit started disappearing, and we started pretending it was still there. We
have failed to recognize that we are at a technological plateau and the trees
are more bare than we would like to think. That’s it. That is what has gone
wrong.”
In his next book, Average Is Over, Cowen predicted an unromantic
future in which a great divide had occurred between the Haves and the
Have Nots. In Cowen’s future, huge gains in artificial intelligence will lead
to the elimination of many of today’s high-employment lines of work. The
people who thrive in this environment will be very bright and able to
complement the machines and team effectively with them. As for the
unemployed masses? Well, many of them will eventually find jobs going to
work for the Haves, who will employ teams of nannies, housekeepers, and
gardeners. If anything Musk is doing might alter the course of mankind
toward a rosier future, Cowen can’t find it. Coming up with true
breakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to
Cowen, because we’ve already mined the bulk of the big discoveries.
During a lunch in Virginia, Cowen described Musk not as a genius inventor
but as an attention seeker, and not a terribly good one at that. “I don’t think
a lot of people care about getting to Mars,” he said. “And it seems like a
very expensive way to drive whatever breakthroughs you might get from it.
Then, you hear about the Hyperloop. I don’t think he has any intention of
doing it. You have to wonder if it’s not meant just to be publicity for his
companies. As for Tesla, it might work. But you’re still just pushing the
problems back somewhere else. You still have to generate power. It could
be that he is challenging convention less than people think.”
These sentiments are not far off from those of Vaclav Smil, a professor
emeritus at the University of Manitoba. Bill Gates has hailed Smil as an
important writer for his tomes on energy, the environment, and
manufacturing. One of Smil’s latest works is Made in the USA, an
exploration of America’s past manufacturing glories and its subsequent,
dismal loss of industry. Anyone who thinks the United States is making a
natural, clever shift away from manufacturing and toward higher-paying
information-worker jobs will want to read this book and have a gander at
the long-term consequences of this change. Smil presents numerous
examples of the ways in which the manufacturing industry generates major
innovations and creates a massive ecosystem of jobs and technical smarts
around them. “For example, when some three decades ago the United States
stopped making virtually all ‘commodity’ consumer electronic devices and
displays, it also lost its capacity to develop and mass-produce advanced flat
screens and batteries, two classes of products that are quintessential for
portable computers and cell phones and whose large-scale imports keep
adding to the US trade deficit,” Smil wrote. A bit later in the book, Smil
emphasized that the aerospace industry, in particular, has been a huge boon
to the U.S. economy and one of its major exporters. “Maintaining the
sector’s competitiveness must be a key component of efforts to boost US
exports, and the exports will have to be a large part of the sector’s sales
because the world’s largest aerospace market of the next two decades will
be in Asia, above all in China and India, and American aircraft and
aeroengine makers should benefit from this expansion.”
Smil is consumed by the United States’ waning ability to compete with
China and yet does not perceive Musk or his companies as any sort of
counter to this slide. “As, among other things, a historian of technical
advances I simply must see Tesla as nothing but an utterly derivative
overhyped toy for showoffs,” Smil wrote to me. “The last thing a country
with 50 million people on food stamps and 85 billion dollars deeper into
debt every month needs is anything to do with space, especially space with
more joyrides for the super rich. And the loop proposal was nothing but
bamboozling people who do not know anything about kindergarten physics
with a very old, long publicized Gedankenexperiment in kinetics. . . . There
are many inventive Americans, but in that lineup Musk would be trailing far
behind.”
The comments were blunt and surprising given some of the things Smil
celebrated in his recent book. He spent a good deal of time showing the
positive impact that Henry Ford’s vertical integration had on advancing the
car industry and the American economy. He also wrote at length about the
rise of “mechatronic machines,” or machines that rely on a lot of electronics
and software. “By 2010 the electronic controls for a typical sedan required
more lines of software code than the instructions needed to operate the
latest Boeing jetliner,” Smil wrote. “American manufacturing has turned
modern cars into remarkable mechatronic machines. The first decade of the
twenty-first century also brought innovations ranging from the deployment
of new materials (carbon composites in aviation, nanostructures) to wireless
electronics.”
There’s a tendency among critics to dismiss Musk as a frivolous
dreamer that stems first and foremost from a misunderstanding of what
Musk is actually doing. People like Smil seem to catch an article or
television show that hits on Musk’s quest to get to Mars and immediately
lump him with the space tourism crowd. Musk, though, hardly ever talks
about tourism and has, since day one, built up SpaceX to compete at the
industrial end of the space business. If Smil thinks Boeing selling planes is
crucial to the American economy, then he should be enthused about what
SpaceX has managed to accomplish in the commercial launch market.
SpaceX builds its products in the United States, has made dramatic
advances in aerospace technology, and has made similar advances in
materials and manufacturing techniques. It would not take much to argue
that SpaceX is America’s only hope of competing against China in the next
couple of decades. As for mechatronic machines, SpaceX and Tesla have set
the example of fusing together electronics, software, and metal that their
rivals are now struggling to match. And all of Musk’s companies, including
SolarCity, have made dramatic use of vertical integration and turned inhouse
control of components into a real advantage.
To get a sense of how powerful Musk’s work may end up being for the
American economy, have a think about the dominant mechatronic machine
of the past several years: the smartphone. Pre-iPhone, the United States was
the laggard in the telecommunications industry. All of the exciting cell
phones and mobile services were in Europe and Asia, while American
consumers bumbled along with dated equipment. When the iPhone arrived
in 2007, it changed everything. Apple’s device mimicked many of the
functions of a computer and then added new abilities with its apps, sensors,
and location awareness. Google charged to market with its Android
software and related handsets, and the United States suddenly emerged as
the driving force in the mobile industry. Smartphones were revolutionary
because of the ways they allowed hardware, software, and services to work
in unison. This was a mix that favored the skills of Silicon Valley. The rise
of the smartphone led to a massive industrial boom in which Apple became
the most valuable company in the country, and billions of its clever devices
were spread all over the world.
Tony Fadell, the former Apple executive credited with bringing the iPod
and iPhone to market, has characterized the smartphone as representative of
a type of super-cycle in which hardware and software have reached a
critical point of maturity. Electronics are good and cheap, while software is
more reliable and sophisticated. Their interplay is now resulting in science
fiction–worthy ideas we were promised long ago becoming a reality.
Google has its self-driving cars and has acquired dozens of robotics
companies as it looks to merge code and machine. Fadell’s company Nest
has its intelligent thermostats and smoke alarms. General Electric has jet
engines packed full of sensors taught to proactively report possible
anomalies to its human mechanics. And a host of start-ups have begun
infusing medical devices with powerful software to help people monitor and
analyze their bodies and diagnose conditions. Tiny satellites are being put
into orbit twenty at a time, and instead of being given a fixed task for their
entire lifetimes, like their predecessors, they’re being reprogrammed on the
fly for a wide variety of business and scientific tasks. Zee Aero, a start-up in
Mountain View, has a couple of former SpaceX staffers on hand and is
working on a secretive new type of transport. A flying car at last? Perhaps.
For Fadell, Musk’s work sits at the highest end of this trend. “He could
have just made an electric car,” Fadell said. “But he did things like use
motors to actuate the door handles. He’s bringing the consumer electronics
and the software together, and the other car companies are trying to figure
out a way to get there. Whether it’s Tesla or SpaceX taking Ethernet cables
and running them inside of rocket ships, you are talking about combining
the old-world science of manufacturing with low-cost, consumer-grade
technology. You put these things together, and they morph into something
we have never seen before. All of a sudden there is a wholesale change,” he
said. “It’s a step function.”
To the extent that Silicon Valley has searched for an inheritor to Steve
Jobs’s role as the dominant, guiding force of the technology industry, Musk
has emerged as the most likely candidate. He’s certainly the “it” guy of the
moment. Start-up founders, proven executives, and legends hold him up as
the person they most admire. The more mainstream Tesla can become, the
more Musk’s reputation will rise. A hot-selling Model 3 would certify Musk
as that rare being able to rethink an industry, read consumers, and execute.
From there, his more fanciful ideas start to seem inevitable. “Elon is one of
the few people that I feel is more accomplished than I am,” said Craig
Venter, the man who decoded the human genome and went on to create
synthetic lifeforms. At some point he hopes to work with Musk on a type of
DNA printer that could be sent to Mars. It would, in theory, allow humans
to create medicines, food, and helpful microbes for early settlers of the
planet. “I think biological teleportation is what is going to truly enable the
colonization of space,” he said. “Elon and I have been talking about how
this might play out.”
One of Musk’s most ardent admirers is also one of his best friends:
Larry Page, the cofounder and CEO of Google. Page has ended up on
Musk’s house-surfing schedule. “He’s kind of homeless, which I think is
sort of funny,” Page said. “He’ll e-mail and say, ‘I don’t know where to stay
tonight. Can I come over?’ I haven’t given him a key or anything yet.”
Google has invested more than just about any other technology
company into Musk’s sort of moon-shot projects: self-driving cars, robots,
and even a cash prize to get a machine onto the moon cheaply. The
company, however, operates under a set of constraints and expectations that
come with employing tens of thousands of people and being analyzed
constantly by investors. It’s with this in mind that Page sometimes feels a
bit envious of Musk, who has managed to make radical ideas the basis of
his companies. “If you think about Silicon Valley or corporate leaders in
general, they’re not usually lacking in money,” Page said. “If you have all
this money, which presumably you’re going to give away and couldn’t even
spend it all if you wanted to, why then are you devoting your time to a
company that’s not really doing anything good? That’s why I find Elon to
be an inspiring example. He said, ‘Well, what should I really do in this
world? Solve cars, global warming, and make humans multiplanetary.’ I
mean those are pretty compelling goals, and now he has businesses to do
that.”
“This becomes a competitive advantage for him, too. Why would you
want to work for a defense contractor when you can work for a guy who
wants to go to Mars and he’s going to move heaven and earth to make it
happen? You can frame a problem in a way that’s really good for the
business.”
At one point, a quotation from Page made the rounds, saying that he
wanted to leave all of his money to Musk. Page felt he was misquoted but
stood by the sentiment. “I’m not leaving my money to him at the moment,”
Page said. “But Elon makes a pretty compelling case for having a
multiplanetary society just because, you know, otherwise we might all die,
which seems like it would be sad for all sorts of different reasons. I think
it’s a very doable project, and it’s a relatively modest resource that we need
to set up a permanent human settlement on Mars. I was just trying to make
the point that that’s a really powerful idea.”
As Page puts it, “Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.” It’s a
principle he’s tried to apply at Google. When Page and Sergey Brin began
wondering aloud about developing ways to search the text inside of books,
all of the experts they consulted said it would be impossible to digitize
every book. The Google cofounders decided to run the numbers and see if it
was actually physically possible to scan the books in a reasonable amount
of time. They concluded it was, and Google has since scanned millions of
books. “I’ve learned that your intuition about things you don’t know that
much about isn’t very good,” Page said. “The way Elon talks about this is
that you always need to start with the first principles of a problem. What are
the physics of it? How much time will it take? How much will it cost? How
much cheaper can I make it? There’s this level of engineering and physics
that you need to make judgments about what’s possible and interesting.
Elon is unusual in that he knows that, and he also knows business and
organization and leadership and governmental issues.”
Some of the conversations between Musk and Page take place at a
secret apartment Google owns in downtown Palo Alto. It’s inside of one of
the taller buildings in the area and offers views of the mountains
surrounding the Stanford University campus. Page and Brin will take
private meetings at the apartment and have their own chef on call to prepare
food for guests. When Musk is present, the chats tend toward the absurd
and fantastic. “I was there once, and Elon was talking about building an
electric jet plane that can take off and land vertically,” said George Zachary,
the venture capitalist and friend of Musk’s. “Larry said the plane should be
able to land on ski slopes, and Sergey said it needed to be able to dock at a
port in Manhattan. Then they started talking about building a commuter
plane that was always circling the Earth, and you’d hop up to it and get
places incredibly fast. I thought everyone was kidding, but at the end I
asked Elon, ‘Are you really going to do that?’ And he said, ‘Yes.’”
“It’s kind of our recreation, I guess,” said Page.23 “It’s fun for the three
of us to talk about kind of crazy things, and we find stuff that eventually
turns out to be real. We go through hundreds or thousands of possible things
before arriving at the ones that are most promising.”
Page talked about Musk at times as if he were a one-of-a-kind, a force
of nature able to accomplish things in the business world that others would
never even try. “We think of SpaceX and Tesla as being these tremendously
risky things, but I think Elon was going to make them work no matter what.
He’s willing to suffer some personal cost, and I think that makes his odds
actually pretty good. If you knew him personally, you would look back to
when he started the companies and say his odds of success would be more
than ninety percent. I mean we just have a single proof point now that you
can be really passionate about something that other people think is crazy
and you can really succeed. And you look at it with Elon and you say,
‘Well, maybe it’s not luck. He’s done it twice. It can’t be luck totally.’ I
think that means it should be repeatable in some sense. At least it’s
repeatable by him. Maybe we should get him to do more things.”
Page holds Musk up as a model he wishes others would emulate—a
figure that should be replicated during a time in which the businessmen and
politicians have fixated on short-term, inconsequential goals. “I don’t think
we’re doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really
important to do,” Page said. “I think like we’re just not educating people in
this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and
scientific background. You should have some leadership training and a bit
of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and
raise money. I don’t think most people are doing that, and it’s a big
problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you’re
able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think
differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work.
I think that’s really an important thing for the world. That’s how we make
progress.”
The pressure of feeling the need to fix the world takes its toll on Musk’s
body. There are times when you run into Musk and he looks utterly
exhausted. He does not have bags under his eyes but rather deep, shadowy
valleys. During the worst of times, following weeks of sleep deprivation,
his eyes seem to have sunk back into his skull. Musk’s weight moves up
and down with the stress, and he’s usually heavier when really overworked.
It’s funny in a way that Musk spends so much time talking about man’s
survival but isn’t willing to address the consequences of what his lifestyle
does to his body. “Elon came to the conclusion early in his career that life is
short,” Straubel said. “If you really embrace this, it leaves you with the
obvious conclusion that you should be working as hard as you can.”
Suffering, though, has always been Musk’s thing. The kids at school
tortured him. His father played brutal mind games. Musk then abused
himself by working inhumane hours and forever pushing his businesses to
the edge. The idea of work-life balance seems meaningless in this context.
For Musk, it’s just life, and his wife and kids try to fit into the show where
they can. “I’m a pretty good dad,” Musk said. “I have the kids for slightly
more than half the week and spend a fair bit of time with them. I also take
them with me when I go out of town. Recently, we went to the Monaco
Grand Prix and were hanging out with the prince and princess of Monaco. It
all seemed quite normal to the kids, and they were blasé about it. They are
growing up having a set of experiences that are extremely unusual, but you
don’t realize experiences are unusual until you are much older. They’re just
your experiences. They have good manners at meals.”
It bothers Musk a bit that his kids won’t suffer like he did. He feels that
the suffering helped to make him who he is and gave him extra reserves of
strength and will. “They might have a little adversity at school, but these
days schools are so protective,” he said. “If you call someone a name, you
get sent home. When I was going to school, if they punched you and there
was no blood, it was like, ‘Whatever. Shake it off.’ Even if there was a little
blood, but not a lot, it was fine. What do I do? Create artificial adversity?
How do you do that? The biggest battle I have is restricting their video
game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to
read more than they play video games. They also can’t play completely
stupid video games. There’s one game they downloaded recently called
Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It’s like a Psych
101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play
Flappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy Bird, but at least there is some
physics involved.”
Musk has talked about having more kids, and it’s on this subject that he
delivers some controversial philosophizing vis-à-vis the creator of Beavis
and Butt-head. “There’s this point that Mike Judge makes in Idiocracy,
which is like smart people, you know, should at least sustain their
numbers,” Musk said. “Like, if it’s a negative Darwinian vector, then
obviously that’s not a good thing. It should be at least neutral. But if each
successive generation of smart people has fewer kids, that’s probably bad,
too. I mean, Europe, Japan, Russia, China are all headed for demographic
implosion. And the fact of the matter is that basically the wealthier—
basically wealth, education, and being secular are all indicative of low birth
rate. They all correlate with low birth rate. I’m not saying like only smart
people should have kids. I’m just saying that smart people should have kids
as well. They should at least maintain—at least be a replacement rate. And
the fact of the matter is that I notice that a lot of really smart women have
zero or one kid. You’re like, ‘Wow, that’s probably not good.’”
The next decade of Musk Co. should be quite something. Musk has
given himself a chance to become one of the greatest businessmen and
innovators of all time. By 2025 Tesla could very well have a lineup of five
or six cars and be the dominant force in a booming electric car market.
Playing off its current growth rate, SolarCity will have had time to emerge
as a massive utility company and the leader in a solar market that had
finally lived up to its promise. SpaceX? Well, it’s perhaps the most
intriguing. According to Musk’s calculations, SpaceX should be conducting
weekly flights to space, carrying humans and cargo, and have put most of
its competitors out of business. Its rockets should be capable of doing a
couple of laps around the moon and then landing with pinpoint accuracy
back at the spaceport in Texas. And the preparation for the first few dozen
trips to Mars should be well under way.
If all of this were taking place, Musk, then in his mid-fifties, likely
would be the richest man in the world and among its most powerful. He
would be the majority shareholder in three public companies, and history
would be preparing to smile broadly on what he had accomplished. During
a time in which countries and other businesses were paralyzed by indecision
and inaction, Musk would have mounted the most viable charge against
global warming, while also providing people with an escape plan—just in
case. He would have brought a substantial amount of crucial manufacturing
back to the United States while also providing an example for other
entrepreneurs hoping to harness a new age of wonderful machines. As Thiel
said, Musk may well have gone so far as to give people hope and to have
renewed their faith in what technology can do for mankind.
This future, of course, remains precarious. Huge technological issues
confront all three of Musk’s companies. He’s bet on the inventiveness of
man and the ability of solar, battery, and aerospace technology to follow
predicted price and performance curves. Even if these bets hit as he hopes,
Tesla could face a weird, unexpected recall. SpaceX could have a rocket
carrying humans blow up—an incident that could very well end the
company on the spot. Dramatic risks accompany just about everything
Musk does.
By the time our last dinner had come around, I had decided that this
propensity for risk had little to do with Musk being insane, as he had
wondered aloud several months earlier. No, Musk just seems to possess a
level of conviction that is so intense and exceptional as to be off-putting to
some. As we shared some chips and guacamole and cocktails, I asked Musk
directly just how much he was willing to put on the line. His response?
Everything that other people hold dear. “I would like to die on Mars,” he
said. “Just not on impact. Ideally I’d like to go for a visit, come back for a
while, and then go there when I’m like seventy or something and then just
stay there. If things turn out well, that would be the case. If my wife and I
have a bunch of kids, she would probably stay with them on Earth.”
EPILOGUE
ELON MUSK IS A BODY THAT REMAINS VERY MUCH IN
MOTION.
By the time this book reaches your hands, it’s quite possible that Musk
and SpaceX will have managed to land a rocket on a barge at sea or back on
a launchpad in Florida. Tesla Motors may have unveiled some of the special
features of the Model X. Musk could have formally declared war on the
artificial intelligence machines coming to life inside of Google’s data
centers. Who knows?
What’s clear is that Musk’s desire to take on more keeps growing. Just
as I was putting the finishing touches on this book, Musk unfurled a number
of major initiatives. The most dramatic of which is a plan to surround the
Earth with thousands of small communications satellites. Musk wants, in
effect, to build a space-based Internet in which the satellites would be close
enough to the planet to beam down bandwidth at high speeds. Such a
system would be useful for a couple of reasons: In areas too poor or too
remote to have fiber-optic connections, it would provide people with highspeed
Internet for the first time. It could also function as an efficient
backhaul network for businesses and consumers.
Musk, of course, also sees this space Internet as key to his long-term
ambitions around Mars. “It will be important for Mars to have a global
communications network,” he said. “I think this needs to be done, and I
don’t see anyone else doing it.” SpaceX will build these satellites at a new
factory and will also look to sell more satellites to commercial customers as
it perfects the technology. To fund part of this unbelievably ambitious
project, SpaceX secured $1 billion from Google and Fidelity. In a rare
moment of restraint, Musk declined to provide an exact delivery date for his
space Internet, which he forecasts will cost more than $10 billion to build.
“People should not expect this to be active sooner than five years,” he said.
“But we see it as a long-term revenue source for SpaceX to be able to fund
a city on Mars.”
Meanwhile, SolarCity has purchased a new research and development
facility near the Tesla factory in Silicon Valley that’s intended to aid its
manufacturing work. The building it acquired was the old Solyndra
manufacturing plant—another symbol of Musk’s ability to thrive in the
green technology industry that has destroyed so many other entrepreneurs.
And Tesla continues to build its Gigafactory in Nevada at pace, while its
network of charging stations has saved upward of four million gallons of
gas. During a quarterly earnings announcement, J. B. Straubel promised that
Tesla would start producing battery systems for home use in 2015 that
would let people hop off the grid for periods of time. Musk then one-upped
Straubel, bragging that he thinks Tesla could eventually be more valuable
than Apple and could challenge it in the race to be the first $1 trillion
company. A handful of groups have also set to work building prototype
Hyperloop systems in and around California. Oh, and Musk starred in an
episode of The Simpsons titled “The Musk Who Fell to Earth,” in which
Homer became his inventive muse.
The heady expansion plans and triumphant rhetoric from Musk were
still not quite enough to hide all of Musk Co.’s flaws. Early 2015 marked
the vociferous return of Musk’s detractors on Wall Street. Tesla’s sales in
China were lackluster by any measure, and some analysts renewed their
doubts about how much long-term demand there would be for the Model S.
Tesla’s shares slumped and, for the first time in a while, Musk sounded
flustered trying to defend the company’s position.
The personal costs of Musk’s lifestyle were more severe. Musk
announced that, once again, he would be divorcing Talulah Riley.
According to Musk, Riley wanted a simpler, smaller life in England and had
come to despise Los Angeles. “Tried to talk her out of it, but she insisted,”
Musk told me. “It is possible that she will change her mind at some point,
but not anytime soon.”
After finishing my reporting and writing for this book, I had a chance to
speak with some of Musk’s confidantes and employees in a more relaxed
manner and bounce various ideas off of them. I’m more convinced than
ever that Musk is, and has always been, a man on a quest, and that his brand
of quest is far more fantastic and consuming than anything most of us will
ever experience. It seems that he’s become almost addicted to expanding his
ambitions and can’t quite stop himself from announcing things like the
Hyperloop and the space Internet. I’m also more convinced than ever that
Musk is a deeply emotional person who suffers and rejoices in an epic
fashion. This side of him is likely obscured by the fact that he feels most
deeply about his own humanity-altering quest and so has trouble
recognizing the strong emotions of those around him. This tends to make
Musk come off as aloof and hard. I would argue, however, that his brand of
empathy is unique. He seems to feel for the human species as a whole
without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals. And
it may well be the case that this is exactly the type of person it takes to
make a freaking space Internet real.
APPENDIX 1
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY LOVES MESSY FOUNDING
TALES. A bit of backstabbing? A hearty helping of deceit? Perfect. And
yet, the press has never really dug into the alleged intrigue surrounding
Musk’s formation of Zip2, nor have reporters examined the very serious
allegations of inconsistencies in Musk’s academic record.
In April 2007, a physicist named John O’Reilly filed a lawsuit alleging
that Musk had stolen the idea for Zip2. According to the lawsuit, filed with
the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara, O’Reilly first met Musk in
October 1995. O’Reilly had started a company called Internet Merchant
Channel, or IMC, which planned to let businesses create primitive,
information-packed online ads. A restaurant, for example, could build an ad
that would display its menu and perhaps even turn-by-turn directions to its
location. O’Reilly’s ideas were mostly theoretical, but Zip2 did end up
providing a very similar service. O’Reilly alleged that Musk had first heard
about this type of technology while trying to get a job working as a
salesman for IMC. He and Musk met on at least three occasions, according
to the lawsuit, to talk about the job. O’Reilly then went on an overseas trip
and struggled to get back in touch with Musk upon his return.
O’Reilly declined to discuss his case against Musk with me. But in the
lawsuit, he claimed to have learned about Zip2 through happenstance many
years after meeting Musk. While reading a book in 2005 about the Internet
economy, O’Reilly stumbled upon a passage that mentioned Musk’s
founding of Zip2 and its 1999 sale to Compaq Computer for $307 million in
cash. The physicist was blown away as he realized that Zip2 sounded a lot
like IMC, which had never amounted to much of a business. O’Reilly’s
mind raced back to his encounters with Musk. He began to suspect that
Musk had avoided him on purpose and that instead of becoming an IMC
salesman, Musk had run off to pursue the same concept on his own.
O’Reilly wanted to be compensated for coming up with the original
business idea. He spent about two years making his case against Musk. The
case file at the court runs hundreds of pages. O’Reilly has affidavits from
people that back up parts of his version of events. A judge, however, found
that O’Reilly lacked the necessary legal standing to bring this case against
Musk due to issues around how his businesses had been dissolved. The
judge ordered O’Reilly to shell out $125,000 for Musk’s legal fees in 2010.
All these years later, Musk still hasn’t made O’Reilly pay.
While playing detective, O’Reilly unearthed some information about
Musk’s past that’s arguably more interesting than the allegations in the
lawsuit. He found that the University of Pennsylvania granted Musk’s
degrees in 1997—two years later than what Musk has cited. I called Penn’s
registrar and verified these findings. Copies of Musk’s records show that he
received a dual degree in economics and physics in May 1997. O’Reilly
also subpoenaed the registrar’s office at Stanford to verify Musk’s
admittance in 1995 for his doctorate work in physics. “Based on the
information you provided, we are unable to locate a record in our office for
Elon Musk,” wrote the director of graduate admissions. When asked during
the case to produce a document verifying Musk’s enrollment at Stanford,
Musk’s attorney declined and called the request “unduly burdensome.” I
contacted a number of Stanford physics professors who taught in 1995, and
they either failed to respond or didn’t remember Musk. Doug Osheroff, a
Nobel Prize winner and department chair at the time, said, “I don’t think I
knew Elon, and am pretty sure that he was not in the Physics Department.”
In the years that have followed, Musk’s enemies have been quick to
bring up the ambiguities around his admission to Stanford. When Martin
Eberhard sued Musk, his attorney introduced O’Reilly’s research into the
case. And during the course of my interviews, a number of Musk’s
detractors from the Zip2, PayPal, and early Tesla days said flat out that they
think Musk fibbed about getting into Stanford in a bid to boost his
credentials as a fledgling entrepreneur and then had to stick with the story
after Zip2 took off.
At first, I, too, felt like there were a lot of oddities surrounding Musk’s
academic record, particularly the Stanford days. But, as I dug in, there were
solid explanations for all of the inconsistencies and plenty of evidence to
undermine the cases of Musk’s detractors.
During the course of my reporting, for example, I found evidence that
contradicted O’Reilly’s timeline of events. Peter Nicholson, the banker
whom Musk had worked for in Canada, took a stroll with Musk along the
boardwalk in Toronto before Musk left for Stanford and chatted about the
incarnations of something like Zip2. Musk had already started writing some
of the early software to support the idea he’d outlined to Kimbal. “He was
agonizing whether to do a PhD at Stanford or take this piece of software
he’d made in his spare time and make a business out of it,” Nicholson said.
“He called the thing the Virtual City Navigator. I told him there was this
crazy Internet thing going on, and that people will pay big money for damn
near anything. This software was a golden opportunity. He could do a PhD
anytime.” Kimbal and other members of Musk’s family have similar
memories.
Musk, speaking at length for the first time on the subject, denied
everything alleged by O’Reilly and does not even recall meeting the man.
“He’s a total scumbag,” Musk said. “O’Reilly is like a failed physicist who
became a serial litigate. And I told the guy, ‘Look, I’m not going to settle an
unjust case. So it’s just like don’t even try.’ But he still kept at it. His case
was tossed out twice on demur, which means that basically even if all the
facts in his case were true, he would still lose.
“He’d tried his best to like torture me through my friends and personally
[by filing the lawsuit]. And then we’ve got summary judgment. He lost the
summary judgment. He appealed summary judgment, then several months
later lost the appeal and I was like, ‘Okay, fuck it. Let’s file for fees.’ And
we were awarded fees from when he appealed. And that’s when we sent the
sheriff after him and he claimed that he had no money basically. Whether he
did or didn’t I don’t know. He certainly claimed he had no money. So we
were like either we’ve got to like impound his car or tap his wife’s income.
Those didn’t seem like great choices. So, we decided that he doesn’t have to
pay back the money he owes me, so long as he doesn’t sue anyone else on
frivolous grounds. And, in fact, late last year or early this year [2014], he
tried to do just that thing. But, whoever he sued was aware of the nature of
my judgment and contacted the lawyer I used, who then told O’Reilly,
‘Look, you need to drop the case against these guys or everyone’s going to
ask for the money. It’s kind of pointless to sue them on frivolous grounds
because you’re going to have fork over the winnings to Elon.’ It’s like go
do something productive with your life.”
As for his academic records, Musk produced a document for me dated
June 22, 2009, that came from Judith Haccou, the director of graduate
admissions in the office of the registrar at Stanford University. It read, “As
per special request from my colleagues in the School of Engineering, I have
searched Stanford’s admission data base and acknowledge that you applied
and were admitted to the graduate program in Material Science Engineering
in 1995. Since you did not enroll, Stanford is not able to issue you an
official certification document.”
Musk also had an explanation for the weird timing on his degrees from
Penn. “I had a History and an English credit that I agreed with Penn that I
would do at Stanford,” he said. “Then I put Stanford on deferment. Later,
Penn’s requirements changed so that you don’t need the English and History
credit. So then they awarded me the degree in ’97 when it was clear I was
not going to go to grad school, and their requirement was no longer there.
“I finished everything that was needed for a Wharton degree in ’94.
They’d actually mailed me a Wharton degree. I decided to spend another
year and finished the physics degree, but then there was that History and
English credit thing. I was only reminded about the History and English
thing when I tried to get an H-1B visa and called the school to get a copy of
my graduation certificate, and they said I hadn’t graduated. Then they
looked into the new requirements, and said it was fine.”
APPENDIX 2
WHILE MUSK HAS REFLECTED PUBLICLY ABOUT HIS TIME AT
PAYPAL AND THE COUP, he went into far greater detail than ever before
during one of our longer interviews. Years had passed since the tumultuous
days surrounding his ouster, and Musk had been able to meditate more on
what went right, what went wrong, and what might have been. He started by
discussing his decision to go out of the country, mixing business with a
delayed honeymoon, and ended with an explanation of how the finance
industry still hasn’t solved the problems X.com wanted to tackle.
“The problem with me going away was that I was not there to reassure
the board on a few things. Like, the brand change, I think it would have
been the right move, but it didn’t need to happen right then. At the time it
was this weird almost hybrid brand with X.com and PayPal. I think X was
the right long-term brand for something that wants to be the central place
where all transactions happen. That’s the X. It’s like the X is the transaction.
PayPal doesn’t make sense in that context, when we’re talking about
something more than a personal payment system. I think X was the more
sensible approach but timing-wise it didn’t need to happen then. That
should have probably waited longer.
“As for the technology change, that’s not really well understood. On the
face of it, it doesn’t sound like it makes much sense for us to be writing our
front-end code in Microsoft C++ instead of Linux. But the reason is that the
programming tools for Microsoft and a PC are actually extremely powerful.
They’re developed for the gaming industry. I mean, this is going to sound
like heresy in a sort of Silicon Valley context, but you can program faster,
you can get functionality faster in the PC C++ world. All of the games for
the Xbox are written in Microsoft C++. The same goes for games on the
PC. They’re incredibly sophisticated, hard things to do, and these great
tools have been developed thanks to the gaming industry. There were more
smart programmers in the gaming industry than anywhere else. I’m not sure
the general public understands this. It was also 2000, and there were not the
huge software libraries for Linux that you would find today. Microsoft had
huge support libraries. So you could get a DLL that could do anything, but
you couldn’t get—you couldn’t get Linux libraries that could do anything.
“Two of the guys that left PayPal went off to Blizzard and helped
created World of Warcraft. When you look at the complexity of something
like that living on PCs and Microsoft C++, it’s pretty incredible. It blows
away any website.
“In retrospect, I should have delayed the brand transition, and I should
have spent a lot more time with Max getting him comfortable on the
technology. I mean, it was a little difficult because like the Linux system
Max had created was called Max Code. So Max has had quite a strong
affinity for Max Code. This was a bunch of libraries that Max and his
friends had done. But it just made it quite hard to develop new features.
And if you look at PayPal today, I mean, part of the reason they haven’t
developed any new features is because it’s quite difficult to maintain the old
system.
“Ultimately, I didn’t disagree with the board’s decision in the PayPal
case, in the sense that with the information that the board had I would have
made maybe the same decision. I probably would have, whereas in the case
of Zip2 I would not have. I thought they just simply made a terrible
decision based on information they had. I don’t think the X.com board
made a terrible decision based on the information they had. But it did make
me want to be careful about who invested in my companies in the future.
“I’ve thought about trying to get PayPal back. I’ve just been too strung
out with other things. Almost no one understands how PayPal actually
worked or why it took off when other payment systems before and after it
didn’t. Most of the people at PayPal don’t understand this. The reason it
worked was because the cost of transactions in PayPal was lower than any
other system. And the reason the cost of transactions was lower is because
we were able to do an increasing percentage of our transactions as ACH, or
automated clearinghouse, electronic transactions, and most importantly,
internal transactions. Internal transactions were essentially fraud-free and
cost us nothing. An ACH transaction costs, I don’t know, like twenty cents
or something. But it was slow, so that was the bad thing. It’s dependent on
the bank’s batch processing time. And then the credit card transaction was
fast, but expensive in terms of the credit card processing fees and very
prone to fraud. That’s the problem Square is having now.
“Square is doing the wrong version of PayPal. The critical thing is to
achieve internal transactions. This is vital because they are instant, fraudfree,
and fee-free. If you’re a seller and have various options, and PayPal
has the lowest fees and is the most secure, it’s obviously the right thing to
use.
“When you look at like any given business, like say a business is
making 10 percent profitability. They’re making 10 percent profit when
they may net out all of their costs. You know, revenue minus expenses in a
year, they’re 10 percent. If using PayPal means you pay 2 percent for your
transactions and using some other systems means you pay 4 percent, that
means using PayPal gives you a 20 percent increase in your profitability.
You’d have to be brain dead not to do that. Right?
“So because about half of PayPal’s transactions in the summer of 2001
were internal or ACH transactions, then our fundamental costs of
transactions were half because we’d have half credit cards, we’d have that
and then the other half would be free. The question then is how do you give
people a reason to keep money in the system.
“That’s why we created a PayPal debit card. It’s a little counterintuitive,
but the easier you make it for people to get money out of PayPal, the less
they’ll want to do it. But if the only way for them to spend money or access
it in any way is to move it to a traditional bank, that’s what they’ll do
instantly. The other thing was the PayPal money market fund. We did that
because if you consider the reasons that people might move the money out,
well, they’ll move it to either conduct transactions in the physical world or
because they’re getting a higher interest rate. So I instituted the highestreturn
money market fund in the country. Basically, the money market fund
was at cost. We didn’t intend to make any money on it, in order to
encourage people to keep their money in the system. And then we also had
like the ability to pay regular bills like your electricity bill and that kind of
thing on PayPal.
“There were a bunch of things that should have been done like checks.
Because even though people don’t use a lot of checks they still use some
checks. So if you force people to say, ‘Okay, we’re not going to let you use
checks ever,’ they’re like, ‘Okay, I guess I have to have a bank account.’
Just give them a few checks, for God’s sake.
“I mean, it’s so ridiculous that PayPal today is worse than PayPal circa
end of 2001. That’s insane.
“None of these start-ups understand the objective. The objective should
be—what delivers fundamental value. I think it’s important to look at things
from a standpoint of what is actually the best thing for the economy. If
people can conduct their transactions quickly and securely that’s better for
them. If it’s simpler to conduct their financial life it’s better for them. So, if
all your financial affairs are seamlessly integrated one place it’s very easy to
do transactions and the fees associated with transactions are low. These are
all good things. Why aren’t they doing this? It’s mad.”

Subject: Going Public
Per my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about
SpaceX going public before the Mars transport system is in place.
Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and
always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public
company diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until
Mars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering,
but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to
foist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature
of our mission.
Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company
experience may think that being public is desirable. This is not so.
Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in
technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for
reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do
with anything except the economy. This causes people to be
distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of
creating great products.
It is important to emphasize that Tesla and SolarCity are public
because they didn’t have any choice. Their private capital structure
was becoming unwieldy and they needed to raise a lot of equity
capital. SolarCity also needed to raise a huge amount of debt at the
lowest possible interest rate to fund solar leases. The banks who
provide that debt wanted SolarCity to have the additional and
painful scrutiny that comes with being public. Those rules, referred
to as Sarbanes-Oxley, essentially result in a tax being levied on
company execution by requiring detailed reporting right down to
how your meal is expensed during travel and you can be penalized
even for minor mistakes.
YES, BUT I COULD MAKE MORE MONEY IF
WE WERE PUBLIC
For those who are under the impression that they are so clever that
they can outsmart public market investors and would sell SpaceX
stock at the “right time,” let me relieve you of any such notion. If
you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then there is
no need to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as you can
just invest in other public company stocks and make billions of
dollars in the market.
If you think: “Ah, but I know what’s really going on at SpaceX
and that will give me an edge,” you are also wrong. Selling public
company stock with insider knowledge is illegal. As a result, selling
public stock is restricted to narrow time windows a few times per
year. Even then, you can be prosecuted for insider trading. At Tesla,
we had both an employee and an investor go through a grand jury
investigation for selling stock over a year ago, despite them doing
everything right in both the letter and spirit of the law. Not fun.
Another thing that happens to public companies is that you
become a target of the trial lawyers who create a class action lawsuit
by getting someone to buy a few hundred shares and then pretending
to sue the company on behalf of all investors for any drop in the
stock price. Tesla is going through that right now even though the
stock price is relatively high, because the drop in question occurred
last year.
It is also not correct to think that because Tesla and SolarCity
share prices are on the lofty side right now, that SpaceX would be
too. Public companies are judged on quarterly performance. Just
because some companies are doing well, doesn’t mean that all
would. Both of those companies (Tesla in particular) had great first
quarter results. SpaceX did not. In fact, financially speaking, we had
an awful first quarter. If we were public, the short sellers would be
hitting us over the head with a large stick.
We would also get beaten up every time there was an anomaly
on the rocket or spacecraft, as occurred on flight 4 with the engine
failure and flight 5 with the Dragon prevalves. Delaying launch of
V1.1, which is now over a year behind schedule, would result in
particularly severe punishment, as that is our primary revenue
driver. Even something as minor as pushing a launch back a few
weeks from one quarter to the next gets you a spanking. Tesla
vehicle production in Q4 last year was literally only three weeks
behind and yet the market response was brutal.
BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
My goal at SpaceX is to give you the best aspects of a public and
private company. When we do a financing round, the stock price is
keyed off of approximately what we would be worth if publicly
traded, excluding irrational exuberance or depression, but without
the pressure and distraction of being under a hot public spotlight.
Rather than have the stock be up during one liquidity window and
down during another, the goal is a steady upward trend and never to
let the share price go below the last round. The end result for you (or
an investor in SpaceX) financially will be the same as if we were
public and you sold a steady amount of stock every year.
In case you are wondering about a specific number, I can say
that I’m confident that our long term stock price will be over $100 if
we execute well on Falcon 9 and Dragon. For this to be the case, we
must have a steady and rapid cadence of launch that is far better
than what we have achieved in the past. We have more work ahead
of us than you probably realize. Let me give you a sense of where
things stand financially: SpaceX expenses this year will be roug[h]ly
$800 to $900 million (which blows my mind btw). Since we get
revenue of $60M for every F9 flight or double that for a FH or F9-
Dragon flight, we must have about twelve flights per year where
four of those flights are either Dragon or Heavy merely in order to
achieve 10% profitability!
For the next few years, we have NASA commercial crew
funding that helps supplement those numbers, but, after that, we are
on our own. That is not much time to finish F9, FH, Dragon V2 and
achieve an average launch rate of at least one per month. And bear
in mind that is an average, so if we take an extra three weeks to
launch a rocket for any reason (could even be due to the satellite),
we have only one week to do the follow-on flight.
MY RECOMMENDATION
Below is my advice about regarding selling SpaceX stock or
options. No complicated analysis is required, as the rules of thumb
are pretty simple.
If you believe that SpaceX will execute better than the average
public company, then our stock price will continue to appreciate at a
rate greater than that of the stock market, which would be the next
highest return place to invest money over the long term. Therefore,
you should sell only the amount that you need to improve your
standard of living in the short to medium term. I do actually
recommend selling some amount of stock, even if you are certain it
will appreciate, as life is short and a bit more cash can increase fun
and reduce stress at home (so long as you don’t ratchet up your
ongoing personal expenditures proportionately).
To maximize your post tax return, you are probably best off
exercising your options to convert them to stock (if you can afford
to do this) and then holding the stock for a year before selling it at
our roughly biannual liquidity events. This allows you to pay the
capital gains tax rate, instead of the income tax rate.
On a final note, we are planning to do a liquidity event as soon
as Falcon 9 qualification is complete in one to two months. I don’t
know exactly what the share price will be yet, but, based on initial
conversations with investors, I would estimate probably between
$30 and $35. This places the value of SpaceX at $4 to $5 billion,
which is about what it would be if we were public right now and,
frankly, an excellent number considering that the new F9, FH and
Dragon V2 have yet to launch.
Elon
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, this will always be two books
instead of one in my mind. There’s the time Before Elon, and the time After
Elon.
The first eighteen months or so of reporting were filled with tension,
sorrow, and joy. As mentioned in the main text, Musk initially opted against
helping me with the project. This left me going from interview subject to
interview subject, giving a huge windup each time to try to talk an ex-Tesla
employee or an old schoolmate into an interview. The highs came when
people agreed to talk. The lows came when key people said no and to not
bother them again. String four or five of those no’s together in a row, and it
felt at times like writing a proper book about Musk was impossible.
The thing that keeps you going is that a few people do say yes and then
a few more, and—interview by interview—you start to figure out how the
past fits together. I’ll be forever grateful to the hundreds of people who
were willing to give freely of their time and especially to those who let me
come back again and again with questions. There are too many of these
people to list, but gracious souls—like Jeremy Hollman, Kevin Brogan,
Dave Lyons, Ali Javidan, Michael Colonno, and Dolly Singh—each
provided invaluable insights and abundant technical help. Heartfelt thanks
go as well to Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, both of whom added
crucial, rich parts to the Tesla story.
Even in this Before Elon period, Musk did permit some of his closer
friends to speak with me, and they were generous with their time and
intellect. That’s a special thanks then to George Zachary and Shervin
Pishevar, and especially to Bill Lee, Antonio Gracias, and Steve Jurvetson,
who really went out of their way for Musk and for me. And I obviously owe
a tremendous debt of gratitude to Justine Musk, Maye Musk, Kimbal Musk,
Peter Rive, Lyndon Rive, Russ Rive, and Scott Haldeman for their time and
for letting me hear some of the family stories. Talulah Riley was kind
enough to let me interview her and keep prying into her husband’s life. She
really brought out some aspects of Musk’s personality that I had not
encountered elsewhere, and she helped build a much deeper understanding
of him. This meant a lot to me, and, I think, it will to the readers as well.
Once Musk agreed to work with me, much of the tension that
accompanied the reporting went away and was replaced by excitement. I
got access to people like JB Straubel, Franz von Holzhausen, Diarmuid
O’Connell, Tom Mueller, and Gwynne Shotwell, who are all among the
most intelligent and compelling figures I’ve run into during years of
reporting. I’m forever grateful for their patience explaining bits of company
history and technological basics to me and for their candor. Thanks as well
to Emily Shanklin, Hannah Post, Alexis Georgeson, Liz Jarvis-Shean, and
John Taylor, for dealing with my constant requests and pestering, and for
setting up so many interviews at Musk’s companies. Mary Beth Brown,
Christina Ra, and Shanna Hendriks were no longer part of Musk Land near
the end of my reporting but were all amazing in helping me learn about
Musk, Tesla, and SpaceX.
My biggest debt of gratitude, of course, goes to Musk. When we first
started doing the interviews, I would spend the hours leading up to our chats
full of nerves. I never knew how long Musk would keep participating in the
project. He might have given me one interview or ten. There was real
pressure to get my most crucial questions answered up front and to be to the
point in my initial interviewing. As Musk stuck around, though, the
conversations went longer, were more fluid, and became more enlightening.
They were the things I most looked forward to every month. Whether Musk
will change the course of human history in a massive way remains to be
seen, but it was certainly a thrilling privilege to get to pick the brain of
someone who is reaching so high. While reticent at first, once Musk
committed to the project, he committed fully, and I’m thankful and honored
that things turned out that way.
On a professional front, I’d like to thank my editors and coworkers over
the years—China Martens, James Niccolai, John Lettice, Vindu Goel, and
Suzanne Spector—each of whom taught me different lessons about the craft
of writing. Special thanks go to Andrew Orlowski, Tim O’Brien, Damon
Darlin, Jim Aley, and Drew Cullen, who have had the most impact on how I
think about writing and reporting and are among the best mentors anyone
could hope for. I must also offer up infinite thanks to Brad Wieners and
Josh Tyrangiel, my bosses at Bloomberg Businessweek, for giving me the
freedom to pursue this project. I doubt there are two people doing more to
support quality journalism.
A special brand of thanks goes to Brad Stone, my colleague at the New
York Times and then at Businessweek. Brad helped me shape the idea for
this book, coaxed me through dark times, and was an unrivaled sounding
board. I feel bad for pestering Brad so incessantly with my questions and
doubts. Brad is a model colleague, always there to help anyone with advice
or to step up and take on work. He’s an amazing writer and an incredible
friend.
Thanks as well to Keith Lee and Sheila Abichandani Sandfort. They are
two of the brightest, kindest, most genuine people I know, and their
feedback on the early text was invaluable.
My agent David Patterson and editor Hilary Redmon were instrumental
in helping pull this project off. David always seemed to say the right thing
at low moments to pick up my spirits. Frankly, I doubt the book would have
happened without the encouragement and momentum he provided during
the initial part of the project. Once things got going, Hilary talked me
through the trickiest moments and elevated the book to an unexpected
place. She tolerated my hissy fits and made dramatic improvements to the
writing. It’s wonderful to finish something like this and come out the other
side with a pair of such good friends. Thanks so much to you both.
Last, I have to thank my family. This book turned into a living,
breathing creature that made life difficult on my family for more than two
years. I didn’t get to see my young boys as much as I would have liked
during this time, but when I did they were there with energizing smiles and
hugs. I’m thankful that they both seem to have picked up an interest in
rockets and cars as a result of this project. As for my wife, Melinda, well,
she was a saint. From a practical perspective, this book could not have
happened without her support. Melinda was my best reader and ultimate
confidante. She was that best friend who knew when to try to energize me
and when to let things go. Even though this book disrupted our lives for a
long while, it brought us closer together in the end. I’m blessed to have such
a partner, and I will forever remember what Melinda did for our family.

8. A southern gentleman, Currie could never get used to Musk’s swearing—“he curses like a sailor
and does it in mixed company”—or the way he would churn through prized talent. “He’d search
through the woods, turn over every rock and dig through brambles to find the one person with
the specific expertise and skill he wanted,” Currie said. “Then, that guy would be gone three
months to a year later if he didn’t agree with Elon.” Currie, though, remembers Musk as
inspirational. Even as Tesla’s funds dwindled, Musk urged the employees to do their jobs well
and vowed to give them what they needed to be successful. Currie, like many people, also found
Musk’s work ethic astonishing. “I would be in Europe or China and send him an email at two
thirty in the morning his time,” Currie said. “Five minutes later, I’d get an answer back. It’s just
unbelievable to have support on that level.”

12. Another moment like this occurred in late 2010 during a launch attempt in Florida. One of the
SpaceX technicians had left a hatch open overnight at the launchpad, which allowed rain to
flood a lower-level computing room. The water caused major issues with SpaceX’s computing
equipment, and another technician had to fly out from California right away with Musk’s
American Express card in hand to fix the emergency in the days leading up to the launch.
The SpaceX engineers bought new computing gear right away and set it up in the room.
They needed to run the equipment through standard tests to make sure it could maintain a
certain voltage level. It was late at night on a Sunday, and they couldn’t get access on short
notice to a device that could simulate the high electrical load. One of the engineers improvised
by going to a hardware store where he bought twenty-five headlamps for golf carts. The SpaceX
crew strung them all together back at the launchpad and hung them from a wall. They then put
on their sunglasses and lit everything up, knowing that if a power supply for the computing
equipment could survive this test, it would be okay for the flight. The process was repeated for
numerous power supplies, and the team worked from 9 P.M. that night until 7 A.M. and finished
in time to keep the launch on track.

14. At the conclusion of the debate, Musk and I exchanged a couple of emails. He wrote, “Oil and
gas is firmly in the Romney camp and they are feeding his campaign these talking points. Until
recently, they didn’t care about Tesla, as they thought we would fail.
“Ironically, it is because they are starting to think Tesla might not fail that they are attacking
us. The reason is that society has to function, so the less there seems to be a viable alternative to
burning hydrocarbons, the less pressure there is to curb carbon emissions. If an electric car
succeeds, it spoils that argument.
“Overall though, I think it is great that he mentioned us :) ‘Romney Tesla’ is one of the top
Google searches!”
I reached out to Romney’s camp months later, as sales of Tesla’s soared, to see if he wanted
to change his position but was rebuffed.
15. As Tesla has grown in size, the company has commanded more respect from suppliers and been
able to get better parts and better deals. But outsourcing components still bothers Musk, and for
understandable reasons. When it tried to ramp up production in 2013, Tesla ran into periodic
issues because of its suppliers. One of them made what should have been an inconsequential 12-
volt lead acid battery that handled a few auxiliary functions in the car. Tesla bought the part
from an American supplier, which in turn outsourced the part from a company in China, which
in turn outsourced the part from a company in Vietnam. By the time the battery arrived at Tesla’s
factories, it didn’t work, adding cost and delays during a crucial period in the Model S’s history.
It’s situations like these that typically result in Tesla playing a much more active role with its
suppliers when compared to other automakers. For something like an ABS braking controller,
Tesla will work hand-in-hand with its supplier—in this case Bosch—to tune the hardware and
software for the Model S’s specific characteristics. “Most companies just hand their cars over to
Bosch, but Tesla goes in with a software engineer,” said Ali Javidan. “We had to change their
mind-set and let them know we wanted to work on a very deep level.”
16. Tesla does seem to promote an obsession with safety that’s unmatched in the industry. J. B.
Straubel explained the company’s thinking as follows: “With the safety stuff, it seems like car
companies have evolved to a place where their design objectives are set by whatever is regulated
or has been standardized. The rule says, ‘Do this and nothing more.’ That is amazingly boring
engineering. It leaves you maybe fiddling with the car’s shape or trying to make it a bit faster.
We have more crumple zones, better deceleration, a lower center of gravity. We went in
wondering, ‘Can we make this car twice as safe as anything else on the road?’”
17. Othmer has lined up to be the lucky owner of the first Roadster II.
Musk has developed an unconventional policy to determine the order in which cars are sold.
When a new car is announced and its price is set, a race begins in which the first person to hand
Musk a check gets the first car. With the Model S, Steve Jurvetson, a Tesla board member, had a
check at the ready in his wallet and slid it across the table to Musk after spying details on the
Model S in a packet of board meeting notes.
Othmer caught a Wired story about a planned second version of the Roadster and emailed
Musk right away. “He said, ‘Okay, I will sell it to you, but you have to pay two hundred
thousand dollars right now.’” Othmer agreed, and Tesla had him come to the company’s
headquarters on a Sunday to sign some paperwork, acknowledging the price of the car and the
fact that the company didn’t quite know when it would arrive or what its specifications would
be. “My guess is that it will be the fastest car on the road,” Othmer said. “It’ll be four-wheel
drive. It’s going to be insane. And I don’t really think that will be the real price. I just don’t
think Elon wanted me to buy it.”
18. Musk suspected Better Place came up with battery swapping as a plan after its CEO, Shai
Agassi, heard about the technology during a tour of the Tesla factory
19. Musk had made a number of art cars over the years at Burning Man, including an electric one
shaped like a rocket. In 2011, he also received a lot of grief from the Wall Street Journal for
having a high-end camp. “Elon Musk, chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Motors and
co-founder of eBay Inc.’s PayPal unit, is among those eschewing the tent life,” the paper wrote.
“He is paying for an elaborate compound consisting of eight recreational vehicles and trailers
stocked with food, linens, groceries and other essentials for himself and his friends and family,
say employees of the outfitter, Classic Adventures RV. . . . Classic is one of the festival’s few
approved vendors. It charges $5,500 to $10,000 per RV for its Camp Classic Concierge
packages like Mr. Musk’s. At Mr. Musk’s RV enclave, the help empties septic tanks, brings
water and makes sure the vehicles’ electricity, refrigeration, air conditioning, televisions, DVD
players and other systems are ship shape. The staff also stocked the campers with Diet Coke,
Gatorade and Cruzan rum.” Once the story hit, Musk’s group felt like Classic Adventures had
leaked the information to drum up business, and they tried to move to a new, undisclosed
location.
20. http://www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf.
21. Tesla employees have been known to sneak across the street to the campus of the software
maker SAP and to take advantage of its sumptuous, subsidized cafes.
22. Shotwell talks about going to Mars as much as Musk and has dedicated her life to space
exploration. Straubel has demonstrated the same type of commitment with electric vehicles and
can sound a lot like Musk at times. “We are not trying to corner the market on EVs,” Straubel
said. “There are 100 million cars built per year and 2 billion already out there. Even if we got to
5 or 10 percent of the market, that does not solve the world’s problems. I am bullish we will
keep up with demand and drive the whole industry forward. Elon is committed to this.”
23. Page presented one of his far-out ideas to me as follows: “I was thinking it would be pretty cool
to have a prize to fund a project where someone would have to send something lightweight to
the moon that could sort of replicate itself. I went over to the NASA operation center here at
AMES in Mountain View when they were doing a mission and literally flying a satellite into the
south pole of the moon. And they like hurled this thing into the moon at a high velocity and then
it exploded and it sent matter out into space. And then they looked at that with telescopes, and
they discovered water on the south pole of the moon, which sounds really exciting. I started
thinking that if there’s a lot of water on the south pole of the moon, you can make rocket fuel
from the hydrogen and oxygen. The other cool thing about the south pole is like it almost always
gets sun. There’s like places high up that get sun and there’s places that are kind of in the craters
that are very cold. So you have like a lot of energy then where you could run solar cells. You
could almost run like a steam turbine there. You have rocket fuel ingredients, and you have solar
cells that can be powered by sun, and you could probably run a power plant turbine. Power plant
turbines aren’t that heavy. You could send that to the moon. You have like a gigawatt of power
on the moon and make a lot of rocket fuel. It would make a good prize project. You send
something to the moon that weights five pounds and have it make rocket fuel so that you could
launch stuff off the moon or have it make a copy of itself, so that you can make more of them.”

* Two years after the birth of his son, John Elon began to show signs of diabetes. The condition
amounted to a death sentence at the time and, despite being only thirty-two, John Elon learned
that he would likely have six months or so to live. With a bit of nursing experience behind her,
Almeda took it upon herself to discover an elixir or treatment that would extend John Elon’s life.
According to family lore, she hit on chiropractic procedures as an effective remedy, and John
Elon lived for five years following the original diabetes diagnosis. The life-giving procedures
established what would become an oddly rich chiropractic tradition in the Haldeman family.
Almeda studied at a chiropractic school in Minneapolis and earned her doctor of chiropractic, or,
D.C., degree in 1905. Musk’s great-grandmother went on to set up her own clinic and, as far as
anyone can tell, became the first chiropractor to practice in Canada.
* Haldeman also entered politics, trying to start his own political party in Saskatchewan, publishing
a newsletter, and espousing conservative, antisocialist ideas. He would later make an unsuccessful
run for Parliament and chair the Social Credit Party.
* The journey took them up the African coast, across the Arabian Peninsula, all the way through
Iran, India, and Malaysia and then down the Timor Sea to Australia. It required one year of
preparation just to secure all of the necessary visas and paperwork, and they suffered from
constant stomach bugs and an erratic schedule along the way. “Dad passed out crossing the Timor
Sea, and mum had to take over until they hit Australia. He woke up right before they landed,”
said Scott Haldeman. “It was fatigue.”
* Both Joshua and Wyn were accomplished marksmen and won national shooting competitions. In
the mid-1950s, they also tied for first place in the eight-thousand-mile Cape Town to Algiers
Motor Rally, beating pros in their Ford station wagon.
* Musk couldn’t remember this particular conversation. “I think they might be having creative
recollection,” he said. “It’s possible. I had lots of esoteric conversations the last couple years of
high school, but I was more concerned about general technology than banking.”
* When Maye went to Canada to check out places to live, a fourteen-year-old Tosca seized the
moment and put the family house in South Africa up for sale. “She had sold my car as well and
was in the midst of putting our furniture up for sale, too,” Maye said. “When I got back, I asked
her why. She said, ‘There is no need to delay. We are getting out of here.’”
* The Musk brothers were not the most aggressive businessmen at this point. “I remember from
their business plan that they were originally asking for a ten-thousand-dollar investment for
twenty-five percent of their company,” said Steve Jurvetson, the venture capitalist. “That is a
cheap deal! When I heard about the three-million-dollar investment, I wondered if Mohr
Davidow had actually read the business plan. Somehow, the brothers ended up raising a normal
venture round.”
* Musk also got to show off the new office to his mother, Maye, and Justine. Maye sometimes sat
in on meetings and came up with the idea of adding a “reverse directions” button on the Zip2
maps, which let people flip around their journeys and ended up becoming a popular feature on all
mapping services.
* At one point, the founders thought the easiest way to solve their problems would just be to buy a
bank and revamp it. While that didn’t happen, they did snag a high-profile controller from Bank
of America, who in turn explained, in painful detail, the complexities of sourcing loans,
transferring money, and protecting accounts.
* Fricker disputed that he yearned to be CEO, saying instead that the other employees had
encouraged him to take over because of Musk’s struggles getting the business off the ground.
Fricker and Musk, once close friends, remain unimpressed with each other. “Elon has his own
code of ethics and honor and plays the game extraordinarily hard,” Fricker said. “When it comes
down to it, for him, business is war.” According to Musk, “Harris is very smart, but I don’t think
he has a good heart. He had a really intense desire to be running the show, and he wanted to take
the company in ridiculous directions.” Fricker went on to have a very successful career as CEO of
GMP Capital, a Canadian financial services company. Payne founded a private equity firm in
Toronto.
* Musk had been pushed out as CEO of X.com by the company’s investors, who wanted a more
seasoned executive to lead the company toward an IPO. In December 1999, X.com hired Bill
Harris, the former CEO of the financial software maker Intuit, as its new chief. After the merger,
many in the company turned on Harris, he resigned, and Musk returned as the CEO.
* After feeling ill for a few days, Musk went to Stanford Hospital and informed them that he’d
been in a malaria zone, although the doctors could not find the parasite during tests. The doctors
performed a spinal tap and diagnosed him with viral meningitis. “I may very well have also had
that, and they treated me for it, and it did get better,” Musk said. The doctors discharged Musk
from the hospital and warned him that some symptoms would recur. “I started feeling bad a few
days later, and it got progressively worse,” Musk said. “Eventually, I couldn’t walk. It was like,
‘Okay, this is even worse than the first time.’” Justine took Musk to a general practitioner in a
cab, and he lay on the floor of the doctor’s office. “I was so dehydrated that she couldn’t take my
vitals,” Musk said. The doctor called an ambulance, which transported Musk to Sequoia Hospital
in Redwood City with IVs in both arms. Musk faced another misdiagnosis—this time of the type
of malaria. The doctors declined to give Musk a more aggressive treatment that came with nasty
side effects including heart palpitations and organ failure.
* When Zubrin and some of the other Mars buffs heard of Musk’s plant project, they were upset. “It
didn’t make any sense,” Zubrin said. “It was a purely symbolic thing to do, and the second they
opened that door, millions of microbes would escape and plague all of NASA’s contamination
protocols.”
* Most of the stories written about Musk that touch on this period say he went to Moscow three
times. According to Cantrell’s detailed records, this is not the case. Musk met with the Russians
twice in Moscow, and once in Pasadena, California. He also met with Arianespace in Paris, and in
London with Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd., which Musk considered buying.
* Buzza knew Hollman’s work at Boeing and coaxed him to SpaceX about six months after the
company started.
* Including a 1,300-pound hunk of copper.
* Before returning to El Segundo, Hollman used a drill press to remove the glasses’ safety shield.
“I didn’t want to look like a nerd on the flight home,” he said.
* Hollman left the company after this incident in November 2007 and then returned for a spell to
train new personnel. A number of people I interviewed for the book said that Hollman was so key
to SpaceX’s early days that they feared the company might flame out without him.
* In a press release announcing the funding round, Musk was not listed as a founder of the
company. In the “About Tesla Motors” section, the company stated, “Tesla Motors was founded
in June 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to create efficient electric cars for people
who love to drive.” Musk and Eberhard would later spar over Musk’s founder status.
* This was how the employee remembered the text. I did not see the actual e-mail. Musk later told
the same employee, “I want you to think ahead and think so hard every day that your head hurts. I
want your head to hurt every night when you go to bed.”
* Musk fought to set the record straight, as he saw it, on the Huffington Post and wrote a 1,500-
word essay. Musk maintained that two months of negotiations with independent parties had gone
into the postnuptial agreement, which kept the couple’s assets separate so that Musk could get the
spoils from his companies and Justine could get the spoils from her books. “In mid 1999, Justine
told me that if I proposed to her, she would say yes,” Musk wrote. “Since this was not long after
the sale of my first company, Zip2, to Compaq, and the subsequent cofounding of PayPal, friends
and family advised me to separate whether the marriage was for love or money.” After the
settlement, Musk asked Arianna Huffington to remove his essay about the divorce from her
website. “I don’t want to dwell on past negativity,” Musk said. “You can always find things on the
Internet. So it’s not like it’s gone. It’s just not easily found.”
* The pair have continued to have their difficulties. For a long time, Musk ran all of the childsharing
scheduling through his assistant Mary Beth Brown rather than dealing directly with
Justine. “I was really pissed-off about that,” Justine said. And the time Justine cried the most
during our conversation came as she weighed the pros and cons of the children growing up on a
grand stage where they’re whisked away to the Super Bowl or Spain in a private jet on a
moment’s notice or asked to play at the Tesla factory. “I know the kids really look up to him,” she
said. “He takes them everywhere and provides a lot of experiences for them. My role as the
mother is to create this reality where I provide a sense of normalcy. They are not growing up in a
normal family with a normal dad. Their life with me is a lot more low-key. We value different
things. I am a lot more about empathy.”
* Musk recalled their meeting as follows: “She did look great, but what was going through my
mind was ‘Oh, I guess they are a couple of models.’ You know, you can’t actually talk to most
models. You just can’t have a conversation. But, you know, Talulah was really interested in
talking about rockets and electric cars. That was the interesting thing.”
* He asked Riley to go with him, but she turned Musk down.
* By this time, Musk had built up a reputation as the hardest-charging man in the space business.
Before settling on the Falcon 9, Musk planned to build something called the BFR, a.k.a. the Big
Falcon Rocket or Big Fucking Rocket. Musk wanted it to have the biggest rocket engine in
history. Musk’s bigger, faster mentality amused, horrified and impressed some of the suppliers
that SpaceX occasionally turned to for help, like Barber-Nichols Inc., a Colorado-based maker of
rocket engine turbo pumps and other aerospace machinery. A few executives at Barber-Nichols—
Robert Linden, Gary Frey, and Mike Forsha—were kind enough to recount their first meeting
with Musk in the middle of 2002 and their subsequent dealings with him. Here’s a snippet:
“Elon showed up with Tom Mueller and started telling us it was his destiny to launch things
into space at lower costs and to help us become space faring people. We thought the world of
Tom but weren’t quite sure whether to take Elon too seriously. They began asking us for the
impossible. They wanted a turbo pump to be built in less than a year for under one million
dollars. Boeing might do a project like that over five years for one hundred million. Tom told us
to give it our best shot, and we built it in thirteen months. Build quick and learn quickly was
Elon’s philosophy. He was relentless in wanting the costs to come down. Regardless of what we
showed him on paper with regard to the cost of materials, he wanted the cost lower because that
was part of his business model. It could be very frustrating to work with Elon. He has a singular
view and doesn’t deviate from that. We don’t know too many people that have worked for him
that are happy. That said, he has driven the cost of space down and been true to his original
business plan. Boeing, Lockheed, and the rest of them have become overly cautious and spend a
lot of money. SpaceX has balls.”
* To provide a glimpse of how well Musk knows the rockets, here he is explaining what happened
from memory six years after the fact: “It was because we had upgraded the Merlin engine to a
regeneratively cooled engine and the thrust transient of that engine was a few seconds longer. It
was only like one percent thrust for about another 1.5 seconds. And the chamber pressure was
only ten PSI, which is one percent of the total. But that’s below sea level pressure. On the test
stand, we didn’t notice anything. We thought it was fine. We thought it was just the same as
before, but actually it just had this slight difference. The ambient sea level pressure was higher at
roughly fifteen PSI, which disguised some effects during the test. The extra thrust caused the first
stage to continue moving after stage separation and recontact the other stage. And the upper stage
then started the engine inside the interstage, which caused the plasma blowback which destroyed
that upper stage.”
* Musk would later discover the identity of this employee in an ingenious way. He copied the text
of the letter into a Word document, checked the size of the file, sent it to a printer, and looked
over the logs of printer activity to find one of the same size. He could then trace that back to the
person who had printed the original file. The employee wrote a letter of apology and resigned.
* Griffin had pined to build a massive new spacecraft that would solidify his mark on the industry.
But, with the election of Barack Obama in 2008, the Bush appointee knew that his time as NASA
chief was coming to an end and that SpaceX appeared poised to build the most interesting
machines moving forward.
* It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt reusable rockets
will work, in large part because of the stress the machines and metal go through during launch.
It’s not clear that the most prized customers will even consider the reused spacecraft for launches
due to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and companies have not
pursued the technology. There’s a camp of space experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his
time, and that engineering calculations already prove the reusable rockets to be a fool’s errand.
* Blue Origin also hired away a large chunk of SpaceX’s propulsion team.
* Musk has taken exception to Blue Origin and Bezos filing for patents around reusable rocket
technology as well. “His patent is completely ridiculous,” Musk said. “People have proposed
landing on a floating platform in the ocean for a half century. There’s no chance whatsoever of
the patent being upheld because there’s five decades of prior art of people who proposed that six
ways to Sunday in fiction and nonfiction. It’s like Dr. Seuss, green eggs and fucking ham. That’s
how many ways it’s been proposed. The issue is doing it and like actually creating a rocket that
can make that happen.”
* Michael Colonno.
* According to Musk, “The early Dragon Version 1 work was just me and maybe three or four
engineers, as we were living hand to mouth and had no idea if NASA would award us a contract.
Technically, there was Magic Dragon before that, which was much simpler, as it had no NASA
requirements. Magic Dragon was just me and some high altitude balloon guys in the U.K.”
* NASA researchers studying the Dragon design have noticed several features of the capsule that
appear to have been purpose built from the get-go to accommodate a landing on Mars. They’ve
published a couple of papers explaining how it could be feasible for NASA to fund a mission to
Mars in which a Dragon capsule picks up samples and returns them to Earth.
* The politicking in the space business can get quite nasty. Lori Garver, the former deputy
administrator of NASA, spent years fighting to open up NASA contracts so that private
companies could bid on things like resupplying the ISS. Her position of fostering a strong
relationship between NASA and the private sector won out in the end but at a cost. “I had death
threats and fake anthrax sent to me,” she said. Garver also ran across SpaceX competitors that
tried to spread unfounded gossip about the company and Musk. “They claimed he was in
violation of tax laws in South Africa and had another, secret family there. I said, ‘You’re making
this stuff up.’ We’re lucky that people with such long-term visions as Elon, Jeff Bezos, and
Robert Bigelow [founder of the aerospace company that bears his name] got rich. It’s nuts that
people would want to vilify Elon. He might say some things that rub people the wrong way, but,
at some point, the being nice to everyone thing doesn’t work.”
* On this flight, SpaceX secretly placed a wheel of cheese inside the Dragon capsule. It was the
same one Jeff Skoll had given Musk back in the mice-to-Mars days.
* Musk explained the look to me in a way that only he can. “I went for a similar style to the Model
S (it uses the same screens as Model S upgraded for space ops), but kept the aluminum isogrid
uncovered for a more exotic feel.”
* Rather insanely, NASA is building a next-generation, giant spaceship that could one day get to
Mars even though SpaceX is building the same type of craft—the Falcon Heavy—on its own.
NASA’s program is budgeted to cost $18 billion, although government studies say that figure is
very conservative. “NASA has no fucking business doing this,” said Andrew Beal, the billionaire
investor and onetime commercial space entrepreneur. “The whole space shuttle system was a
disaster. They’re fucking clueless. Who in their right mind would use huge solid boosters,
especially ones built in segments requiring dynamic seals? They are so lucky they only had one
disastrous failure of the boosters.” Beal’s firm criticisms come from years of watching the
government compete against private space companies by subsidizing the construction of
spacecraft and launches. His company Beal Aerospace quit the business because the government
kept funding competing rockets. “Governments around the world have spent billions trying to do
what Elon is doing, and they have failed,” he said. “We have to have governments, but the idea
that the government goes out and competes with companies is fucking nuts.”
* The volume level on the sound system naturally goes to 11—an homage to This Is Spinal Tap and
a reflection of Musk’s sense of humor.
* And it’s not just that the Model S and other electric cars are three to four times more efficient
than internal combustion vehicles. They can also tap into power that is produced in centralized,
efficient ways by power plants and solar arrays.
* When the very first Roadster arrived, it came in a large plywood crate. Tesla’s engineers
unpacked it furiously, installed the battery pack, and then let Musk take it for a spin. About
twenty Tesla engineers jumped in prototype vehicles and formed a convoy that followed Musk
around Palo Alto and Stanford.
* At some point from late 2007 to 2008, Musk also tried to hire Tony Fadell, an executive at Apple
who is credited with bringing the iPod and iPhone to life. Fadell remembered being recruited for
the CEO job at Tesla, while Musk remembered it more as a chief operating officer type of
position. “Elon and I had multiple discussions about me joining as Tesla’s CEO, and he even
went to the lengths of staging a surprise party for me when I was going to visit their offices,”
Fadell said. Steve Jobs caught wind of these meetings and turned on the charm to keep Fadell.
“He was sure nice to me for a while,” Fadell said. A couple of years later, Fadell left Apple to
found Nest, a maker of smart-home devices, which Google then acquired in 2014.
* It took a couple of years, from about 2007 to 2009, for the Energy Department application to
morph into the actual possibility of a loan from the government.
* The deal had two parts. Tesla would keep making battery packs and associated technology that
other companies might use, and it would produce its own electric vehicles at a manufacturing
facility in the United States.
* Musk had received a lot of pushback internally for trying to locate a car factory in or near
California. “All the guys in Detroit said it needs to be in a place where the labor can afford to live
and be happy,” Lloyd said. “There’s a lot of learned skill on an assembly line, and you can’t
afford turnover.” Musk responded that SpaceX had found a way to build rockets in Los Angeles,
and that Tesla would find a way to build cars in Northern California. His stubbornness ended up
being fortuitous for the company. “If it hadn’t been for that DOE loan, and the NUMMI plant,
there’s no way Tesla would have ended up being so successful, so fast,” Lloyd said.
* Boeing used to make fuselages for the 747 in the SpaceX building and painted them in what
became the Tesla design studio.
* “He picks the most visible place on purpose,” said the investor and Tesla board member Steve
Jurvetson. “He’s at Tesla just about every Saturday and Sunday and wants people to see him and
know they can find him. Then, he can also call suppliers on the weekend, and let them know that
he’s personally putting in the hours on the factory floor and expects the same from them.”
* Tesla got its start using the same lithium ion batteries that go into consumer electronics like
laptops. During the early days of the Roadster, this proved a risky but calculated choice. Tesla
wanted to tap into Asia’s mature battery suppliers and get access to cheap products that would
keep improving over time. The press played up Tesla’s use of these types of batteries, and
consumers were fascinated by the idea that a car could be powered by the same energy source
sitting inside of their gizmos.
There’s a major misconception that Tesla still depends on these types of batteries. Yes, the
batteries inside the Model S look like those found in a laptop. Tesla, however, started developing
its own battery chemistry in conjunction with partners like Panasonic dating back to late models
of the Roadster. Tesla can still use the same manufacturing equipment as consumer electronics
companies while ending up with a battery that’s safer and better tuned to the intense charging
demands of its cars. Along with the secret formula for the battery cells themselves, Tesla has
improved the performance of its batteries by developing its own techniques for linking the cells
together and cooling them. The battery cells have been designed to vent heat in a very particular
way, and there’s coolant running throughout the entire battery pack. The battery packs are
assembled at the Tesla factory in an area hidden from visitors.
The chemistry, the batteries, the battery pack design—these are all elements of a large,
continuous system that Tesla has built from the ground up to allow its cars to charge at record
speed. To control the heat produced during the charging process, Tesla has designed an
interlinked system of radiators and chillers to cool both the batteries and the chargers. “You’ve
got all that hardware plus the software management system and other controllers,” said J. B.
Straubel. “All of these things are running at maximum rate.” A Model S can recharge 150 miles
of range in 20 minutes at one of Tesla’s charging stations with DC power pumping straight into
the batteries. By comparison, a Nissan Leaf that maxes out at 80 miles of range can take 8 hours
to recharge.
* Google’s attorneys had asked to make a presentation to Tesla’s board. Before he would permit
this, Musk asked for the right to call on Google for a loan in case Tesla encountered cash flow
issues after acquisition talks became public, as there would otherwise be no way for Tesla to raise
money. Google hesitated on this for a few weeks, by which time Tesla ended up in the clear.
* Following the demonstration, Tesla struggled to deliver on the battery swap technology. Musk
had promised that the first few stations would arrive in late 2013. A year after the event, though,
Tesla had yet to open a single station. According to Musk, the company ended up needing to deal
with more pressing issues. “We’re going to do it because we said we’d do it,” Musk said. “It may
not be on the schedule that we’d like but we always come through in the end.”
* As for the origins of the Model S name, Musk said, “Well, I like calling things what they are. We
had the Roadster, but there was no good word for a sedan. You can’t call it the Tesla Sedan.
That’s boring as hell. In the U.K., they say ‘saloon,’ but then it’s sort of like, ‘What are you? A
cowboy or something?’ We went through a bunch of iterations, and the Model S sounded the best.
And it was like a vague nod to Ford being the Model T in that electric cars preceded the Model T,
and in a way we’re coming full circle and the thing that proceeded the Model T is now going into
production in the twenty-first century, hence the Model S. But that’s sort of more like reversing
the logic.”
* A handful of lawsuits have been filed against Tesla with auto dealers arguing that the company
should not be able to sell its cars directly. But even in those states that have banned Tesla’s stores,
prospective customers can usually request a test drive, and someone from Tesla will show up with
a vehicle. “Sometimes you have to put something out there for people to attack,” Musk said. “In
the long run, the stores won’t be important. The way things will really grow is by word of mouth.
The stores are like a viral seed to get things going.”
* Or as Straubel put it, “Watching people drive the Model S across the country is phenomenal.
There is no way you can do that in anything else. It’s not about putting a charging station in the
desert as a stunt. It’s about realizing where this is going to go. We will end up launching the thirdgeneration
car into a world where this charging network is free and ubiquitous. It bugs me when
people compare us to a car company. The cars are absolutely our main product, but we are also an
energy company and a technology company. We are going down to the dirt and having
discussions with mining companies about the materials for our batteries and going up to
commercialize all the pieces that make up an electronic vehicle and all the pieces that make an
awesome product.”
* No, really. Both Lyndon and his wife play underwater hockey and used these skills to secure
green cards, meeting the criteria for the “exceptional abilities” the United States desires. They
ultimately played for the U.S. national teams.
* Thirteen thousand people showed up in 2013.
* If you assume an average selling price of $40,000 per car for 300,000 cars sold in a year, that’s
$12 billion in annual revenue, or $1 billion per month.
* For the space buffs, here’s Musk talking more about the physics and chemistry of the spaceship:
“The final piece of the puzzle for figuring out the Mars architecture is a methane engine. You
need to be able to generate the propellant on the surface. Most of the fuel used in rockets today is
a form of kerosene, and creating kerosene is quite complex. It’s a series of long-chain
hydrocarbons. It’s much easier to create either methane or hydrogen. The problem with hydrogen
is it’s a deep cryogen. It’s only a liquid very close to absolute zero. And because it’s a small
molecule you have these issues where hydrogen will seep its way through a metal matrix and
embrittle or destroy metal in weird ways. Hydrogen’s density is also very porous, so the tanks are
enormous and it’s expensive to create and store hydrogen. It’s not a good choice as a fuel.
“Methane, on the other hand, is much easier to handle. It’s liquid at around the same
temperature as liquid oxygen so you can do a rocket stage with a common bulkhead and not
worry about freezing one or the other solid. Methane is also the lowest-cost fossil fuel on Earth.
And there needs to be a lot of energy to go to Mars.
“And then on Mars, because the atmosphere is carbon dioxide and there’s a lot of water or ice
in the soil, the carbon dioxide gets you CO2, the water gives you H2O. With that you create CH4
and O2, which gives you combustion. So it’s all sort of nicely worked out.
“And then one of the key questions is can you get to the surface of Mars and back to Earth on
a single stage. The answer is yes, if you reduce the return payload to approximately one-quarter
of the outbound payload, which I thought made sense because you are going to want to transport
a lot more to Mars than you’d want to transfer from Mars to Earth. For the spacecraft, the heat
shield, the life support system, and the legs will have to be very, very light.”
* Musk and Riley were divorced for less than year. “I refused to speak with him for as long it took
for the divorce to be finalized,” Riley said. “And then, once it was finalized, we immediately got
back together.” As for what caused the breakup, Riley said, “I just wasn’t happy. I thought maybe
I had made the wrong decision for my life.” And, about what brought her back to Musk, Riley
said, “One reason was the lack of viable alternatives. I looked around, and there was no one else
nice to be with. Number two is that Elon doesn’t have to listen to anyone in life. No one. He
doesn’t have to listen to anything that doesn’t fit into his worldview. But he proved he would take
shit from me. He said, ‘Let me listen to her and figure these things out.’ He proved that he valued
my opinion on things in life and was willing to listen. I thought it was quite a telling thing for the
man—that he made the effort. And then, I loved him and missed him.”
* As Musk recalled, “I told her, ‘Look, I think you’re very valuable. Maybe that compensation is
right. You need to take two weeks’ vacation, and I’m going to assess whether that’s true our not.’
Before this came up, I had offered her multiple all-expenses-paid vacations. I really wanted her to
take a vacation. When she got back, my conclusion was just that the relationship was not going to
work anymore. Twelve years is a good run for any job. She’ll do a great job for someone.”
According to Musk, he offered Brown another position at the company. She declined the offer by
never showing up at the office again. Musk gave her twelve months’ severance and has not
spoken to her since.
* According to Riley, “Elon is kind of cheeky and funny. He is very loving. He is devoted to his
children. He is funny—really, really, really funny. He’s quite mercurial. He’s genuinely the oddest
person I have ever met. He has moments of self-awareness and lucidity, which for me always
bring him back around. He’ll say something cheeky or funny and have this grin. He’s smart in all
sorts of areas. He’s very well read and has this incredible wit. He loves movies. We went to see
the new Lego Movie and afterwards he insisted on being referred to as Lord Business. He tries to
come home early for family dinners with me and the kids and maybe play some computer games
with the boys. They will tell us about their day, and we’ll put them to bed. Then we’ll chat and
watch something together on the laptop like The Colbert Report. On the weekends, we’re
traveling. The kids are good travelers. There were bajillions of nannies before. There was even a
nanny manager. Things are a bit more normal now. We try and do stuff just as a family when we
can. We have the kids four days a week. I like to say that I am the disciplinarian. I want them to
have the sense of an ordinary life, but they live a very odd life. They were just on a trip with
Justin Bieber. They go to the rocket factory and are like, ‘Oh no, not again.’ It’s not cool if your
dad does it. They’re used to it.
“People don’t realize that Elon has this incredible naiveté. There are certain times when he is
incapable of anything other than pure joy. And then other times pure anger. When he feels
something, he feels it so completely and purely. Nothing else can impose on it. There are so few
people who can do that. If he sees something funny, he will laugh so loudly. He won’t realize we
are in a crowded theater and that other people are there. He is like a child. It’s sweet and amazing.
He says this random stuff like, ‘I am a complicated man with very simple but specific needs’ or
‘No man is an island unless he is large and buoyant.’ We make these lists of things we want to do.
His latest contributions were to walk on a beach at sunset and whisper sweet nothings in each
other’s ear and to take more horseback rides. He likes reading, playing video games, and being
with friends.”
* Jurvetson elaborated by saying, “Elon has that engineering prowess of Gates, but he’s more
interpersonal. You have to be out there on the spectrum with Gates. Elon has more interpersonal
charms. He’s like Jobs in that neither of them suffer fools. But with Jobs there was more of a
hero-shit roller coaster where employees went from in favor to out of favor. I also think Elon has
accomplished more.”

I really like computer games, but then if I made
really great computer games, how much effect would
that have on the world? – Elon Musk
When people today talk about modern-day success
stories in entrepreneurship, engineering, and
technological innovation, Elon Musk's name
inevitably garners much of the discussion. Musk is
the name behind some of the most recognizable,
trailblazing, and talked-about companies this
century. He is constantly ranked among the
wealthiest business magnates in the world whilst
also maintaining a persona akin to a rock star
which only serves to contribute to his popularity.
A look at the background and beginnings of Elon
Reeve Musk reveals where he gets much of his
innovative and exploring spirit. His father, Errol
Musk, is an electromechanical engineer, sailor and
pilot. Meanwhile, his mother Maye, is a model and
a dietician. Musk's father is a native of South
Africa, while his mother is originally from
Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Musk's ancestry
includes British, American, and Pennsylvania Dutch
roots.
Musk was born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa
on June 28, 1971. Pretoria, a city in the northern
region of Gauteng, is one of South Africa's
capital cities and is known to be a center of
academic study, with three major universities, the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
(CSIR), and the South African Bureau of Standards
within its territory. Pretoria is the birthplace
of many other notable South Africans, including
athlete Oscar Pistorius, entrepreneur Sammy Marks,
South African Republic president Paul Kruger, and
venture capitalist Roelof Botha.
As a child, Musk showed an early love for reading,
devouring several books at a time. The young Musk
was an introvert compared to his younger siblings
Kimbal and Tosca. Much of his childhood was spent
in the suburbs of Pretoria, particularly
Waterkloof, an affluent area where many foreign
diplomats resided. Musk's parents divorced in
1980, and he mostly lived with his father.
Recreation included thoroughbred horses, trips on
their father's yacht, and holiday travels to
Europe, Hong Kong, and the United States.
Although it was common for wealthy South African
families to hire household staff, Errol determined
early on to train his children to do their own
household chores and learn to cook their own
meals. "I guess I was a bit of an autocratic
father — do this, do that. I was a single parent,
and they simply had to help out," Errol said in an
interview to The Mercury News .
Musk's passion for reading eventually led to an
early interest in computers. He owned a Commodore
Vic 20, a Spectra video, and an IBM, all of which
added to his interest in learning more about
computing and computer programming. In fact, at
the age of 12, he successfully taught himself
programming and designed the code for a BASICbased
video game called Blastar. The space-themed
PC game looks like a mix between Space Invaders
and Asteroid, with the player's mission to destroy
alien spacecraft carrying hydrogen bombs and
destroyer machines. A 12-year-old Elon was able to
sell the code for Blastar to the magazine PC and
Office Technology for $500.
Unfortunately, Musk was not spared from being
bullied throughout his childhood. Because he was
bookish and socially awkward, interested more in
science fiction and computers, classmates picked
on him constantly. At one time, Musk's classmates
pushed him down a long, concrete stairwell. In
another instance, the young Musk was beaten so
severely that he had to be taken to the hospital.
Recalling his childhood experience with bullying,
Musk recalled one instance when the bullies used
his best friend to lure him out of hiding, and
then they proceeded to beat him up. “For some
reason they decided that I was it, and they were
going to go after me nonstop. That’s what made
growing up difficult.” Musk said this bullying
lasted for many years with no end in sight. He
would get chased by the gangs at school who wanted
to beat him up, and they would follow him home.
“It would just be awful there as well,” he said.
Still, Musk showed resilience despite the
difficulties. A former geography teacher of his,
Ewyn van den Aardweg, recalls a smart and
inquisitive child. "I would see him frequently in
or around the library. Musk had an above-average
interest in matters outside the normal curriculum,
and the library — these were pre-Internet years —
was the place to gain further knowledge."
Van den Aardweg also noticed that Musk's school
uniform was always neat and clean compared to the
other boys in school, indicating that even though
he was superior to the others in intellect and
out-of-the-box thinking, he put a priority on
self-discipline and the value of hard work.
Because his father was a wealthy and successful
engineer, Musk went to private schools in the
Pretoria suburbs, such as the Waterkloof House
Preparatory School, an English-speaking private
school with boarding facilities. Waterkloof House
counts among its notable pupils the professional
golfer Richard Sterne, novelist Tony Peake, and
journalist Deon Chang.
Musk went on to graduate from the Pretoria Boys
High School. He was a member of the high school
chess team at the prestigious learning
institution, but he stopped competing when he
realized that humans could not beat the computers
that were playing chess. After graduating high
school, Musk studied for a short time at the
University of Pretoria, but his sights were soon
set elsewhere.
In 1989, at the age of 17, Elon decided he would
move to Canada because he wanted to attend the
Queen's School of Business in Kingston, Ontario.
This was at a time when the country of South
Africa was undergoing much political upheaval,
with the apartheid system of racial segregation
being torn down. With the uncertainty in the
country's political and economic climate, many
South Africans were leaving the country for
England, Australia, and North America in search of
better opportunities. Musk also intended to move
to Canada to avoid mandatory service in the
military.
Elon's brother Kimbal also moved to Canada shortly
thereafter to attend Queen's. A friend of the
brothers at the school, Dominic Thompson, recalls
the intelligence and deep knowledge of Elon in
many fields of study. "It’s rare to have the mix
of business knowledge with the understanding of
physics and science, along with raw intelligence,
and focus. He’s always known what he wanted to
do," Thompson said.
It was not all smooth sailing for Musk when he
first moved to Canada. He worked various odd jobs
to support himself, such as tending vegetables and
shoveling out grain bins at a farm owned by his
cousin, cutting logs using a chain saw in
Vancouver, and even cleaning a lumber mill's
boiler room, a job that paid $18 an hour.
Musk recalls having to wear a hazmat suit and then
trying to fit through a very little tunnel as part
of the job, then having to use a shovel to take
sand, goop, and other steaming hot residue out
through the same hole. “Someone else on the other
side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you
stay in there for more than thirty minutes, you
get too hot and die."
His hard work and enterprising spirit went on all
throughout his college years. From his dorm room,
Musk would sell computer parts and personal
computers to earn extra money. "I could build
something to suit their needs like a tricked-out
gaming machine or a simple word processor that
cost less than what they could get in a store,"
according to Musk. "Or if their computer didn't
boot properly or had a virus, I'd fix it. I could
pretty much solve any problem."
The passion and competitiveness displayed by Musk
today was already very evident during his stay at
Queen's, where he liked to join public speaking
competitions and compare test notes with his
classmates. Musk's roommate Navaid Farooq recounts
their many hours of studying together or playing
board games, but also Musk's superior intellect.
"When Elon gets into something, he develops just
this different level of interest in it than other
people. That is what differentiates Elon from the
rest of humanity."
After two years at Queen's, Musk decided to
transfer to the University of Pennsylvania after
being offered a scholarship. He pursued dual
degrees—a bachelor's degree in physics from the
College of Arts and Sciences, and an economics
degree from the university's Wharton School of
Business.
Musk's mother Maye says he became more sociable
and gained more friends at Penn, particularly
people who enjoyed the same interests as him, and
were pretty much at his level of intellect and
discourse. “There were some nerds there,” Maye
recounts. “He so enjoyed them. I remember going
for lunch with them, and they were talking physics
things ... They would laugh out loud. It was cool
to see him so happy."
One person who became a very close friend of Elon
at this time is Adeo Rossi. Together, the two
would move out of the university's freshman dorm
and rent their own ten-bedroom fraternity house,
where they would invite their friends for parties
and social events. Ressi would convert the home
into a nightclub during the weekends. He described
the atmosphere as like a full-on “speakeasy” with
as many as many as five hundred people showing up
to party. “We would charge five dollars, and it
would be pretty much all you could drink—beer and
Jell-O shots and other things," according to
Ressi.
Despite their residence being a center of college
parties, Musk was not a big drinker, only
partaking of vodka and Diet Coke every once in a
while. "Somebody had to stay sober during these
parties. I was paying my own way through college
and could make an entire month's rent in one
night. Adeo was in charge ... around the house,
and I would run the party."
Ressi described Elon as “the most straight-laced
dude” he ever met. “He never drank. He never did
anything. Zero. Literally nothing," Ressi said.
It was also during his years studying at Penn that
Musk developed his interest in harnessing solar
power and other sources of renewable energy. For
one of his classes, Musk had to put together a
business plan, and he wrote a paper entitled "The
Importance of Being Solar" discussing renewable
energy and predicting an increase in the adoption
of solar power technology as materials improved.
In the paper, Musk discussed in detail how solar
power can become more accessible, detailing how
solar cells operate and how they can be made more
efficient.
Musk also drew a "power station of the future"
before concluding the paper, showing solar arrays
from space sending power down to Earth using
microwave beams and a receiving antenna. Musk's
professor gave him a grade of 98 for the paper,
noting that it was very well-written and
interesting.
Other topics that Musk wrote about in college
include a database for research documents, books,
and optical character recognition, as well as
ultracapacitors for energy storage. Regarding
energy storage, Musk wrote that the end result
signifies a new means of storing sizeable amounts
of electrical energy, not seen since the
development of the battery and fuel cell. He also
postulated that because the ultracapacitor has the
same basic properties of a capacitor, “it can
deliver its energy over one hundred times faster
than a battery of equivalent weight, and be
recharged just as quickly." He was graded a 97 for
this paper.
While in college, Musk toyed with the idea of
getting into the video game business after
graduation. After all, he loved playing video
games, and he already had experience coding a
computer game when he was 12. He even held a
gaming internship, so it seemed like a match for
his skills. But eventually, Musk decided that a
video game business was not a worthy pursuit, and
he could do better.
Musk said in the book Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX,
and the Quest for a Fantastic Future , written
about his life, "I really like computer games, but
then if I made really great computer games, how
much effect would that have on the world? It
wouldn't have a big effect.” Musk had an affinity
for video games since his childhood, but for some
reason he could not picture himself developing
video games for the rest of his life, knowing he
could use his talents for bigger, better things
that could benefit more people and leave a true
impact upon the world.
His ideas began to revolve more and more around
the Internet, developing renewable energy, and
space travel. Elon had the foresight to see that
these three areas would be where he could make his
biggest impact. Even while he was studying, he
already had a pretty good idea where he wanted to
focus his talents. "I really was thinking about
this stuff in college," Elon said. "It is not some
invented story after the fact. I don't want to
seem like ... I'm chasing a fad or just being
opportunistic.”
Musk did not want to be known as an investor, and
wanted to stay away from the label. Instead, he
declared, “I like to make technologies real that I
think are important for the future and useful in
some sort of way."
After he graduated with dual degrees, Musk went to
California's Stanford University, intending to
pursue a PhD in energy physics. He was already
accepted into the program and was about to start,
but Musk decided to defer his admission to start
an Internet company. It was 1995, and the Internet
boom was underway. In the next chapter, we will
look at Musk’s beginnings as an entrepreneur.
Chapter Summary
Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa on
June 28, 1971 to Errol and Maye Musk.
He grew up in a city that is known as an academic
center, and was educated in private schools.
Early in life, he already displayed much of the
intellect and competitiveness that have continued
to define him today.
At the age of 12, he taught himself computer
programming and sold a code for a computer game
for $500.
Elon graduated from Pretoria Boys High School,
then moved to Canada to attend the Queen's School
of Business.
He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania
where he completed dual degrees in economics and
physics.
Chapter Two: The Young Entrepreneur
––––––––
I think the best way to attract venture capital is
to try and come up with a demonstration of
whatever product or service it is and ideally take
that as far as you can. Just see if you can sell
that to real customers and start generating some
momentum. The further along you can get with that,
the more likely you are to get funding. – Elon
Musk
Just two days after being accepted into Stanford,
Elon Musk decided to drop out and start his very
first company, Zip2. The web software company was
founded by Elon along with his brother Kimbal and
Greg Kouri, in Palo Alto, California. They were
able to start the company with $28,000 from Errol
Musk, plus an additional $6,000 from Kouri.
Zip2 was first known as Global Link Information
Network. When it was first started by the Musk
brothers and Kouri in 1995, the company serviced
local businesses in the Palo Alto area by
connecting them with online searchers and
providing directions to their place of business.
The initial system used a Navteq database and a
Palo Alto business database, merged to provide
data. Renamed Zip2 the following year, it became
an online city guide and provided licensed Webbased
city guide software to newspaper publishers
across the area.
In 1996, the company received an investment of $3
million from Mohr Davidow Ventures, and it moved
from local business sales to national newspaper
directories. Zip2 was able to score successful
deals with major national newspaper stalwarts such
as the Hearst Corporation, The New York Times ,
Knight Ridder and the Chicago Tribune . Zip2
became a big player in what the Editor & Publisher
described as the U.S. newspaper industry's answer
to the online city guide industry, competing with
Yahoo! and America Online which were the big names
at the time.
Two years after rebranding to Zip2 and shifting
its strategy, the company was partnered with about
160 newspapers around the U.S., developing backend
online city guides. Zip2 was also providing
newspapers with other services such as a calendar,
online directory, and e-mail services. Another
product of Zip2, the Auto Guide, allowed online
newspaper users to connect with local car
dealerships or private car sellers.
By April of 1998, Zip2 had become successful
enough to attempt to merge with its main rival,
CitySearch. The online city guide founded in La
Crescenta, California by Jeffrey Brewer, Caskey
Dickson, Brad Haaugard, Tamar Halpern, and Taylor
Wescoatt also served businesses in the United
States. Talks of the merger soon commenced between
the two companies, and the deal was estimated to
be worth around $300 million.
The merged entity would have retained the
CitySearch brand and brought together 700
employees, covering 175 cities in the U.S.
Regarding leadership, CitySearch chief executive
Charles Conn would serve as executive chairman,
while Musk would serve as vice chairman and
executive vice president of product and
technology.
Initially, Musk was optimistic about the planned
agreement, calling it a "true merger of equals."
He also announced that the reason for the merger
was to meet the market demand as well as to retain
leadership in their category. An IPO was also
planned for the merger. However, more than a month
after the talks were announced, Zip2 and
CitySearch called off the merger plans, with both
parties pointing to "incompatibilities in cultures
and technology" as the reason for the failed
merger. By August of that same year, CitySearch
had merged with Ticketmaster Online instead. It
was later revealed that it was Musk himself who
convinced the board of Zip2 not to go through with
the merger.
Meanwhile, another acquisition would soon take
place, but this time from a much larger entity
from the outside. Compaq Computer announced in
February 1999 that it was acquiring Zip2 for $307
million, with the private company becoming a unit
of Compaq's AltaVista web search service. Zip2's
board of directors approved the cash purchase of
Zip2's outstanding shares, and this time Musk did
not object. Elon earned $22 million from the
Compaq sale, while his brother Kimbal, also a cofounder
of Zip2, netted $15 million.
After his success with Zip2, Musk had another plan
on hand. In March of 1999, a little more than a
month after Compaq's purchase of Zip2, he cofounded
a Web-based financial services and e-mail
payment company called X.com, using about $10
million he netted from the Zip2 sale.
X.com operated pretty much as an online bank, with
its deposits insured by the FDIC. The following
year, X.com merged with another company,
Confinity, which was operating an online money
transfer service dubbed as PayPal. After the
merger, the company decided to focus its attention
on the burgeoning PayPal service, with a popular
marketing campaign aggressively recruiting new
customers who were receiving money via PayPal.
The merged company started with Musk as CEO (as
well as the biggest shareholder). However, he soon
had disagreements with the rest of the company
leaders regarding the direction of X.com/PayPal,
particularly his interest in transferring the
infrastructure of PayPal from Unix to Microsoft
Windows. PayPal's core team did not like this
idea, and the board decided to oust Musk as CEO
and replace him with Peter Thiel.
This took place while Musk was on a flight heading
to Australia, on what would have been his first
vacation in several years. "That's the problem
with vacations," Musk would later say, while
admitting that he was not aligned philosophically
with the founders of PayPal, citing Thiel’s
perspective in particular as “pretty odd”. "He’s
(Thiel) a contrarian from an investing standpoint
and thinks a lot about the singularity,” Musk
said. On the contrary, he said he is less excited
about that aspect of business. “I’m pro-human,"
Musk said.
Musk remained on the board even after his ouster
as CEO, and he owned 11% of the company’s stock.
As PayPal grew, it caught the attention of yet
another online giant, eBay, and in 2002 eBay
announced it was acquiring PayPal. Before the
acquisition, the online auction giant had its own
online payment service, eBay Payments by
Billpoint. However, most of its customers
preferred to use PayPal instead, with Merrill
Lynch and analyst Justin Baldauf referring to
PayPal as "the gorilla in the online payment
market".
The decision to acquire its rival, rather than try
to beat it, made perfect sense for eBay. With a
price tag of $1.5 billion in stock, the PayPal
purchase allowed eBay to retain more control over
the payment services on its platform. It was also
a giant payday for Musk, and the newly-acquired
wealth from the sale of PayPal enabled him to set
his sights elsewhere—out of Silicon Valley.
In the next chapter, we will take a look at
SpaceX, the company Musk started out of his love
for space travel, and how Musk's innovation has
revolutionized rocket science.
Chapter Summary
Zip2 was the first company started by Elon Musk.
The web software company licensed Web-based city
guide software programs and provided other
services to businesses.
In 1999, Compaq Computer acquired Zip2 for $307
million, turning Zip2 into a unit of AltaVista.
Elon Musk's second business enterprise was X.com,
an online financial services and payment provider.
Musk was the CEO of the merged X.com/PayPal, but
he soon became at odds with the board and was
ousted from his position while on his way to
Australia for a vacation.
X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 and soon
became PayPal, the leading online payment
provider.
In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal in a $1.5 billion
deal.
Chapter Three: The Rise Of SpaceX
––––––––
The next big moment will be life becoming multiplanetary.
– Elon Musk
When PayPal was bought by eBay, Elon Musk, who was
PayPal's largest shareholder, received $165
million. This big sum of money allowed him to now
focus his attention on something he had loved
since childhood: space travel. With his pockets
now awash with cash, Musk set out to start Space
Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX.
SpaceX grew out of Musk's concept of landing a
miniature greenhouse on Mars and growing plants.
He conceptualized this plan in his Mars Oasis
project in 2001, trying to shore up waning public
interest in space exploration and technology while
also lobbying to increase the budget allocation
for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA).
In the Mars Oasis project, Musk wanted to grow
food crops on Mars using refurbished
intercontinental ballistic missiles from Russia.
The refurbished ICBMs would carry the payloads to
space, guided from Earth. In October 2001, Musk
travelled to Moscow accompanied by Adeo Ressi, his
college buddy, and Jim Cantrell, an aerospace
equipment and supplies fixer. The three met with
several Russian companies such as NPO Lavochkin
and Kosmotras.
Ressi, who was Musk's close friend since their
college days, was trying his best to discourage
the project. He thought of the space exploration
idea as a waste of Musk's money, and tried to
dissuade him by sending videos of exploding
European, American, and Russian rockets. Ressi
even tried to stage interventions with the help of
other friends of Musk's, but his friend was
determined.
Cantrell, however, said in an interview with
Bloomberg that the meetings with the Russians did
not go as planned, especially because the Russians
did not take Musk seriously, viewing him as a
novice. "One of their chief designers spit on me
and Elon because he thought we were full of s***,"
according to Cantrell. Musk and his cohorts were
not able to finalize any deals for refurbished
rockets, and they returned to the United States.
Another trip to Russia in 2002 yielded the same
results, the team coming up empty-handed.
Flying home from the second Russian trip, Musk
then realized that with his resources, he could
instead start his own company and build the
cheaper space rockets that he needed for his Mars
exploration goals. Doing the calculations, Musk
found that the cost of the raw materials to build
his own rocket would only be 3 percent of what he
would shell out if he bought them from the
Russians.
With the new plan in mind, Musk set out to find
staff for his space company. He networked with
different space experts, bringing them together at
events he hosted in California. Scientists from
NASA were among those Musk consulted with. In
particular, Musk talked to rocket engineer and
designer Tom Mueller, who agreed to work for
Musk's company. Mueller became one of the founding
employees of SpaceX.
Mueller brought a lot of engineering and rocket
design experience to SpaceX. Before joining Musk's
team, Mueller was affiliated with aerospace firm
TRW, based in Redondo Beach, California. In his
spare time, Mueller built his own engines and
launched them in the Mojave Desert, often with
friends and aerospace aficionados from the
Reaction Research Society. When Musk found out
about Mueller and met with him in January of 2002,
he saw a homemade rocket engine Mueller was
building, and asked, "Can you build something
bigger?"
It was the start of Mueller's career with Musk's
SpaceX. The company now has over 6,000 employees,
and Mueller is the Chief Technology Officer of
Propulsion. His work on the TR-10, Merlin Rocket
Engines, and Dragon spacecraft propulsion are
highly regarded throughout the industry. When
Popular Mechanics interviewed Mueller in 2009
regarding his experience working for Musk’s
SpaceX, he compared it to his previous company,
saying, "TRW is a huge company with a tiny
propulsion department. Here, I'm kind of king."
SpaceX has been at the forefront of many space
rocket achievements, including the first orbit of
a private venture liquid-fuelled rocket (Falcon 1
Flight 4, September 28, 2008); first company to
use private funding; first funded company to be
successful in launching, orbiting, and recovering
a spacecraft (Falcon 9 Flight 2, December 9,
2010); first spacecraft from a privately-owned
company to be sent to the ISS (Falcon 9, May 25,
2012); the very first successful re-launch and
landing from space of a used orbital rocket; first
controlled return trip and recovery of a payload
fairing rocket (Falcon 9, March 30, 2017); and
many other notable milestones.
The goal of SpaceX as a company is to develop
rocket technology and make humanity a spacefaring
civilization using space launch vehicles. From its
founding in 2002, SpaceX focused on designing
space launch and spacecraft vehicles with superior
engineering. Its track record allowed SpaceX to be
awarded a contract with NASA to continue
developing and testing the Falcon 9 and Dragon
spacecraft for transporting cargo to the
International Space Station. NASA also awarded
SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract in 2008 for the
Commercial Resupply Services program to the Space
Station, which was previously handled by the US
Space Shuttle.
SpaceX is now considered the world's largest
private producer of rocket engines, far outpacing
the Russian companies Musk intended to work with
when he first envisioned his space exploration
plans. SpaceX holds the current record for a
rocket engine's highest thrust-to-weight ratio
(Merlin 1D). There are about 100 Merlin 1D engines
in operation today in the world.
So why all the energy, investment, and effort into
SpaceX? Musk believes that space travel is a
necessary step in the preservation and expansion
of the human race, and there may come a time when
humans must occupy other planets in order to
ensure the survival of the species. In an
interview with Esquire , Musk said the next big
moment of human life will be becoming a multiplanetary
species, and this would serve to
progress the diversity of human collective
consciousness.
"It would also serve as a hedge against the myriad
—and growing—threats to our survival," Musk said.
The entrepreneur certainly views an asteroid hit
or a super-volcanic eruption as credible threats
to the survival of humankind, but he is also
concerned about other threats, not experienced
yet, by other species, such as an engineered
virus, a nuclear war, the accidental creation of a
micro black hole, or the discovery of a yetunknown
technology that could bring about the end
of life as we know it. “Sooner or later, we must
expand life beyond our little blue mud ball," Musk
reiterates, or humankind will become extinct.
Passionate as he may be about exploring the worlds
beyond Earth, Musk has not lost any interest in
making life better for our home planet. In the
next chapter, we will explore another company that
Musk founded – Tesla.
Chapter Summary
Elon Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies
Corp. or SpaceX using part of the money he
received from the sale of PayPal to eBay.
Musk's space exploration interest was
conceptualized in his Mars Oasis project, which
sought to land greenhouses and grow crops on Mars.
When his first attempts to buy affordable space
rockets from Russian suppliers failed, Musk
decided to start his own space rocket company.
SpaceX has scored numerous contracts with NASA and
is now the leading private rocket engine company
in the world.
Musk is determined to make the human race a multiplanetary
species, believing that space travel
will save humans from becoming extinct in the
future.
Chapter Four: Tesla Hits The Road
––––––––
Either I went all in, or Tesla dies. – Elon Musk
Elon Musk already had his hands full with SpaceX,
but somehow, he still found the time to venture
into another company. Tesla Inc., formerly known
as Tesla Motors, was started in 2003 by Martin
Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, with co-founders Ian
Wright, JB Straubel, and Musk. Tesla is an
automotive company known for its innovations in
electric-powered cars, lithium-ion batteries for
energy storage, and residential solar panels (via
SolarCity, its subsidiary).
As CEO of Tesla, Musk wants to produce affordable,
efficient, mass market electric cars that would
reduce pollution and dependence on oil. The
company is named after Nikola Tesla, the
electrical engineer and physicist known for his
invention of the induction motor, alternating
current power transmission, and other trailblazing
concepts. Musk himself looks up to Tesla, along
with Thomas Edison.
The idea for Tesla came about when automaker GM
recalled its EV1 electric cars in 2003. Musk said
in a recent tweet that very few people are aware
of how they started toying with the idea of Tesla
when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from
customers in 2003 and then proceeded to destroy
the vehicles. As the big car companies were ending
their EV programs for a number of reasons, their
only hope to keep the electric vehicle dream alive
was to start their own EV company, even though it
(Tesla) was almost certain to fail, Musk said in a
series of tweets.
Initial funding for Tesla came from Eberhard and
Tapperning. Musk led the Series A round in
February of 2004, and joined the board of
directors, assuming the chairmanship. Most of the
money he invested in Tesla came from personal
funds. Also, Musk thought of a direction for Tesla
that would prove to be pivotal to its eventual
success in the market.
The first vehicle designed and produced by Tesla
was a high-end sports car, mostly targeted at
early adopters. Musk envisioned that if early
adopters bought the Tesla Roadster, and word
spread about its energy efficiency and ability to
beat other high-performance sports cars from
Porsche or Ferrari, succeeding models which would
be more affordable for the mass market would not
need advertising or marketing campaigns.
Musk, in fact, is known in the industry as someone
who has always disliked the traditional
advertising methods. He has put most of his
company's resources towards product improvement,
letting the superior quality speak for themselves.
Tesla, for the most part, does not spend on
advertising campaigns. Instead, free cash flow
into Tesla is invested heavily in research and
development, engineering, design, and
manufacturing, all with the goal of building the
best car possible, according to Musk.
Musk used the money from the first high-end Tesla
vehicles towards building even better and more
affordable electric vehicles rather than
maintaining a highly visible presence in mass
media. He banked on word-of-mouth doing its part
in spreading information about Tesla’s product
offerings. Musk put a premium on the Tesla
vehicles, so he could rely on the superior quality
of the vehicles to generate positive feedback and
be the best form of advertising.
This strategy of utilizing word-of-mouth has
certainly worked in Tesla’s favor. Throughout the
Internet, you will find dozens of community forums
and online groups of Tesla’s devoted followers.
All are committed to promoting Tesla’s brand with
the firm belief that the vehicles are the wave of
the future, and hold the answer to the many
environmental problems facing the world due to
pollution from traditional oil-powered cars. To
these passionate Tesla-lovers, they are not just
buying a vehicle, but becoming an active part of
the future in automobile technology.
In his statement when the Tesla Roadster was
launched, Musk acknowledged that the highperformance
sports car was an expensive vehicle
even for its class, but the company intended to
channel earnings from the Roadster to produce more
affordable electric vehicles. Musk explained that
their strategy at Tesla was to enter the high end
of the market first, targeting those customers who
are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down
the market as quickly as they could, with higher
unit volume and lower prices as newer models were
produced.
He then announced that the second model in the
works at Tesla was a four-door family car, to be
produced and shipped at around half the price tag
of the Tesla Roadster, and a third model would
also be produced soon at an even lower price tag.
This strategy became a hit among Tesla fans, who
warmed to the idea of forking out big bucks for an
electric vehicle that would help in the
development of more affordable electric cars down
the line. Soon, pre-orders and production demand
for Tesla vehicles were more than the company
could handle.
The Tesla Roadster was the very first production
automobile to utilize lithium-ion battery cells,
and the first EV to achieve a range higher than
200 miles per charge. From its launch in 2008
until March of 2012, more than 2,250 Roadsters
were sold by Tesla in 31 countries around the
world.
Tesla launched its IPO on NASDAQ on June 29, 2019;
with 13 million shares of common stock made
available to the public at $17 per share. Tesla's
IPO raised $226 million. By June 2012, Tesla's
popular Model S sedan began shipping across key
markets, with Musk announcing that they were
determined to show the world that "an electric car
can in fact be the best car in the world." He
boasted of the technology, interface, styling,
performance, and safety of the Model S, calling it
"fundamentally better" than anything else in its
class. By December 2015, more than 100,000 Model S
cars had been sold all over the world.
In 2017, Tesla achieved another milestone by
briefly surpassing both Ford Motor Company and
General Motors in market capitalization, making it
the most valuable automaker in the American
market. Tesla also appeared in the Fortune 500
list for the first time in June 2017. Considering
that Musk had thought Tesla was almost certain to
fail at the beginning, this was a remarkable feat
indeed.
With his foray into electric cars underway, Musk
continued to explore even more ways to develop
renewable energy sources. This time, he would
become involved in solar power, and in the next
chapter we will look at Solar City and how it is
paving the way in its own niche.
Chapter Summary
Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard, Marc
Tapperning, Ian Wright, JB Straubel, and Elon
Musk.
Much of the initial funds for Tesla came from
Musk's personal funds.
Tesla is now a leading innovator in electric
powered vehicles and lithium-ion batteries for
energy storage.
Instead of advertising on mass media, Musk wanted
Tesla to focus on designing and producing topquality
electric cars, and relying on word-ofmouth
to boost sales.
By 2017, Tesla had entered the Fortune 500 list
and become one of the most valuable American
automotive companies.
Chapter Five: SolarCity Shines Through
––––––––
To solve the sustainable-energy question, we need
sustainable-energy production, which is going to
come primarily in the form of solar. – Elon Musk
A subsidiary of Tesla , Inc., SolarCity
Corporation was founded on July 4, 2006 by Lyndon
and Peter Rive, cousins of Elon Musk. The company
has its main offices in San Mateo, California, and
is involved in the marketing, manufacturing,
installation, and maintenance of residential and
commercial solar panels across the United States.
After its merger with Tesla, Inc. in 2016,
SolarCity began offering energy storage services,
such as a turnkey residential battery backup
solution compatible with Powerwall.
The idea for SolarCity, not surprisingly, came
from Musk's concept. Musk presented the Rive
brothers with a concept for a solar company, and
even offered to help them start the company.
Lyndon was then a tech entrepreneur in Silicon
Valley, looking for ways to give back to the
community. He warmed to the idea of alternative
energy, and along with his brother Peter started
the solar installation start-up.
It helped that they resided in California, the
biggest solar market in the United States.
SolarCity offered extensive warranties
guaranteeing the optimum performance of its solar
modules, and provided remote monitoring so its
systems were always working. By 2009, SolarCity's
installed solar panels were producing 440
megawatts of power.
A study by GTM Research in 2013 showed SolarCity
as the top residential solar installation company
in the U.S. Meanwhile, Solar Power World magazine
hailed SolarCity as the No. 2 overall solar
installation company, behind Arizona's First
Solar. By 2015, SolarCity panels were generating
870 megawatts of solar power, or roughly 28
percent of all non-utility solar power
installation in the U.S.
In June of 2016, Tesla floated an acquisition
offer to SolarCity for up to $3 billion, with Musk
declaring that it would be a seamless integration
between Tesla's battery products and the solar
power products of SolarCity. SolarCity accepted
the offer on August 1, 2016 for $2.6 billion.
SolarCity has been at the forefront of the growth
of solar power adoption across the U.S., and it is
constantly finding ways to make solar power more
accessible and affordable to homeowners and
business owners, pursuant to Musk's vision. One of
the very first solar leasing programs of
SolarCity, started in 2008, allowed qualified
homeowners to pay less than what they were paying
for electricity from their local utility company.
The lease program of SolarCity leases rooftop
solar to homeowners without having to pay any
upfront or installation costs, while in return
having to pay for 20 years for the solar power
generated. This business model, while proving to
be very popular with residential customers,
drained cash reserves from SolarCity. In 2017, the
company announced a shift in its business model,
requiring customers to purchase the solar power
systems via cash or financing.
Aside from residential solar power installations,
SolarCity also has commercial solar projects. In
2008, SolarCity completed a commercial solar
installation for eBay's North Campus in San Jose,
California, and another for San Francisco's
British Motor Car Distributors, which was made up
of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels. SolarCity has
also introduced different financing options
specifically for businesses since 2009, and has
ongoing solar projects for Intel, Walmart, and the
United States military.
SolarCity purchased the SolSource Energy business
of Clean Fuel Connections in 2009, and then
subsequently started its electric car charging
services. A partnership in 2011 with Rabobank
allowed owners of Tesla electric vehicles to
charge their cars for free when travelling along
Route 101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
With Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity, where is
Musk leading the partnership? Aside from the new
financing options, Musk wants to make the roof
solar panels more aesthetically appealing to
customers, with two types of tiles—solar and nonsolar—
to be used for the installation. Buyers can
customize the design based on their house's style,
choosing from four main options, namely, Slate
Glass Tile, Smooth Glass Tile, Tuscan Glass Tile,
and Textured Glass Tile. The tiles come with an
infinity warranty.
Many insiders believe that Musk's push to bring
SolarCity into the Tesla fold is part of his
grander plan to eventually produce a solar-powered
car. Musk had already hinted in 2016 that a solar
roof for vehicles is likely to be offered as an
option for future Tesla customers.
For his part, however, the entrepreneur says the
deal is all part of a long-term vision that one
day, his will be a diversified renewable energy
company with product offerings generating
electricity from sustainable means, storing it for
long-term capabilities, and powering residences
and vehicles without the need for fossil fuels.
Speaking to the press in June 2016, Musk remarked
that production of sustainable energy in the
future will come primarily from solar. Combined
with stationary storage and electric cars, it will
be an all-around and full-scale solution to a
future that is sustainable in energy, Musk said,
reiterating that all three components are needed,
and Tesla should be right there with the
solution.
It is a strategic position indeed for Musk’s Tesla
and SolarCity ventures, especially with the
increased awareness regarding renewable energy and
the growing call among many sectors in society to
lessen dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in
developed nations. With Musk at the helm,
SolarCity is poised to lead the way and become a
profitable enterprise in the years to come.
What are some important lessons we can learn from
the colourful life of Elon Musk? We will explore
some of these takeaways in the next chapter.
Chapter Summary
SolarCity was started in 2006 by Elon Musk's
cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.
SolarCity a leading solar power installation
company in the United States.
As of 2016, a merger between Tesla Inc. and
SolarCity was approved, bringing two Muskaffiliated
ventures under one company.
SolarCity's business model of leasing solar roof
installations to customers will cease in 2017,
with new customers now being given the option to
either pay cash or purchase via financing.
There are speculations that Musk will soon offer
electric-powered vehicles under the Tesla and
SolarCity umbrella.
Chapter Six: Valuable Lessons
––––––––
If things are not failing, you are not innovating
enough. - Elon Musk
Elon Musk has proven himself to be a visionary and
an effective leader, and this is evident from the
many interviews and quotes attributed to him, as
well as anecdotes from the people around him who
know him on a personal level. It is also quite
evident that he is using his influence, the best
that he can, to inspire others around him to aim
for excellence and reach for something better.
What key aspects can we learn from Musk's success
so far?
First, it is important to have a vision in life .
Vision encompasses your overall goals or ambitions
in life, referring both to general aspirations as
well as more specific targets. Having a vision in
life will endow you with a drive to keep going
regardless of obstacles that may come up. Vision
also keeps you on track, lessening diversions from
the tasks and responsibilities at hand, especially
when there are distractions that lurk along the
way and may derail you from your aspirations in
life.
Very early on in his life, Musk already had a
vision to make a difference in several key areas
that he knew would have a notable impact on the
world, including the Internet, renewable energy,
space exploration, artificial intelligence, and
the possibility of life outside Earth . Throughout
his ventures, business decisions, and
acquisitions, he always had his end goal in sight.
Each step he took was one step closer towards his
bigger vision.
Another key lesson from Musk is his insistence on
setting the standard rather than following
everyone else in the traditional path . Musk is a
trailblazer who is always looking for ways to
shake things up and improve the products and
services that people are already using. In setting
the standard, Musk is often seen as too radical or
progressive, but he stands up for what he believes
in and continues to prove the naysayers wrong. He
sticks to his ideas despite any opposition because
he already set his mind to going against the trend
instead of following it.
What is the traditional, standard, accepted
practice in your industry or profession, and how
can you go the extra mile to further improve your
product or service while also creating better
value for your target market? Always remember that
any attempt you make to raise the standard for
your peers or competitors should have the goal of
improving processes, services, or products.
Intended change should be positive and contribute
to enhancement and a higher level of quality.
One of the interesting components of Musk’s
passion to elevate the standard is his decision to
share Tesla Motors’ patented electric vehicle
technologies with other automobile manufacturers
in good faith. This came about due to his desire
to really see electric vehicles take over and
become the norm in the near future, thereby
reducing pollution and global dependence on oil.
Because of this commitment, he was willing to set
aside competition, sharing the technologies with
his industry peers with the hopes of advancing the
entire group.
Musk, in his years of proven success as a business
owner, CEO, engineer, and innovator, realized that
for him to continue growing and improving in his
various pursuits, he had to welcome the critiques
of the people around him and take criticism in a
positive way so that he could get even better at
his craft. In fact, he took this lesson so
seriously that he only focused his attention on
the negative comments from those around him.
Musk starts off by always assuming that he is
wrong about something, whether it is an idea or a
proposal, and must be corrected . He is quoted as
saying, “You should take the approach that you’re
wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.” With this
perspective, it becomes easier for Musk to take in
harsh criticism from peers or employees because he
has already established that he needs correction
instead of walking around with a chip on his
shoulder thinking he has the best idea.
Granted, Musk almost always has the best ideas,
and he is indeed a brilliant man with a lot to
offer. But he is still open to improvement and he
is always seeking out feedback instead of avoiding
it. Musk once talked about the importance of
having a feedback loop in your organization, where
each individual is thinking about what he has done
and how it could be done better.
It’s remarkable how Musk still seeks out negative
feedback from people around him whom he trusts,
considering how intelligent he truly is. Remember
that he taught himself computer programming at 10
years old and by the following year already sold
the code for a video game for US$500. His concepts
for the SpaceX rockets, electric cars and
powertrains, the Hyperloop mass transport system,
and other innovations are now considered to be
genius and ground-breaking. Yet at this stage in
his life, he still values the comments of others
in the know.
Be ready and willing to listen to the voices of
those who have gone before you and can share their
experiences with you, and be open to critique from
those in your target audience who are seeking out
excellence and quality in products or services
they patronize. These types of feedback will be
part of your learning and development, helping to
mould you into a leader that is aware and willing
to change for the better.
You must also look at how Musk views failure. He
was not always successful the first time he tried
something. In fact, he understood failure and
recognized that it was a possibility in so many of
his ventures and innovations. But he also knew it
was part of the risk of being an innovator and
wanting to change the current system, so he did
not allow himself or his companies to be sidetracked
by failures. Instead, he used his past
failures to become more resolute, improve ideas,
and eventually come out with more successful
innovations.
Because Musk was always looking at the bigger
picture, he came to accept failure as just another
outcome he must endure, so he was not afraid to
gamble and put all he had into achieving what he
wanted to achieve. Also, those mistakes served to
give him and his team lessons on what to avoid
next time and how to become better at what they
do. Nowadays, SpaceX has different contracts with
NASA and other private groups for its rocket
technology, and is making a profit. Tesla Motors
is leading the way in electric vehicle technology.
The failures of the past made Musk and his
companies stronger and better prepared.
Failure builds character . Character is borne from
patience and perseverance, two qualities which are
sorely lacking at a time when information is
available at everyone’s fingertips, and appliances
and gadgets have permeated daily life, as people
have become so used to getting what they want very
quickly. Failure teaches you the reality that a
lot of times, if your goal is to create something
of substance, you will have to work hard for it
and fine-tune the concept until it works exactly
how you envisioned it to.
Consider failure as an essential part of your
learning and development . The reason why Musk’s
ventures are even more successful these days is
because they have been through very public
failures in the past, all of which made them grow
as a team and afforded them with more insights for
improvement. Consider failure as an ally rather
than an enemy, greet it with a positive mindset,
and you will reap the benefits in your endeavours,
much like Musk did.
Another remarkable thing about Musk and his life
story, is his quest to find a greater purpose in
what he is doing . Many people in today’s
materialistic, success-oriented society are
working for things that do not really last or can
only provide temporary happiness with no real or
lasting results beyond one’s lifetime. The focus
of much of modern-day society is on earning more
money, climbing up the corporate ladder, amassing
bigger houses and newer cars, visiting the most
exotic destinations, and fulfilling just about
every luxury or extravagance the world has to
offer. While these things are not wrong, they
should not be all that life is about.
Musk could have easily decided to pursue a career
as a video game developer, as we discussed in a
previous chapter. Given his love for video games
and his abilities, he could have set out to
develop video games and earn big bucks in doing
so. But Musk knew he had the unique position to
aim for much better things, and he realized he
could use his skills to truly make a difference in
the world around him.
His love for reading books on philosophy and
spirituality played a vital role in shaping his
decision to aim higher. He once talked about
having an existential crisis in his younger years,
trying to come up with an answer to the question,
"What does it all mean?" He concluded, after much
soul-searching, that if he could take part in
advancing the knowledge of humankind, and do his
part in expanding the scope and scale of
consciousness within the realm of human
experience, he could come closer to enlightenment
and reach the right answers.
This quest for purpose continues to fuel his many
entrepreneurial ventures. Musk became passionate
about becoming part of the solution for many
problems facing the world today, including the
dependence on oil, increased pollution from
vehicles and its effects on the environment, and
even unlocking the traffic jams of major
metropolitan areas such as Southern California.
Using money that he made from successful ventures
in Zip2 and PayPal, he poured his wealth into
Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, with the long-term
goal of global transformation.
There have been countless times when Musk’s
exploits were seen as too revolutionary,
disruptive, or simply unattainable. However, he
forged on and did not mind all the negative
conversation around him, because he had a clear
purpose in mind and he knew that one day, people
will see what he was already envisioning in his
mind. This purpose-filled determination is now
being seen, of course, in the achievements already
driving the industries where Musk’s businesses are
leading the pack.
A few years ago, the electric vehicle industry was
doomed for failure, with major automakers giving
up or refusing to even consider it as a viable
alternative. Musk saw this as an opportunity to
lead, and with the success of Tesla’s vehicles,
electric vehicles are becoming more common
throughout the world. In addition, the technology
used for Tesla’s automobiles are now the blueprint
of similar designs for other automakers embarking
on their own electric vehicle programs, and it is
no longer considered unrealistic to envision a
future where the world relies primarily on
electricity to power sustainable transport
options.
Musk is also an example of hard work, and the
value of a work ethic, even though he is already
brilliant and naturally talented. He still puts in
close to 100 hours of work every week, even saying
once that an entrepreneur putting in 100 hours a
week will achieve in just four months what others
logging 40 hours weekly will achieve in a year's
time.
It has been said that Musk does not regularly take
lunch breaks either, instead turning his lunch
hour into office meetings or a time to catch up on
e-mails. He maximizes his hours and seeks to
become more productive by trying to squeeze in as
much work as possible in the same 24-hour period
given to him as everyone else.
Musk once likened creating a company to having a
child, and said that is why he is willing to
commit as many hours as needed to make sure that
everything goes as smoothly as planned. He does
not balk at logging many hours each week, or
reaching into his personal funds to finance his
ventures, just to keep his companies going during
rough times, because of his intense commitment and
passion to succeed.
Even after failures, Musk would show up at the
office, because he knows that a strong work ethic
entails showing up, even on days when he would
rather be somewhere else, instead of overseeing
responsibilities. Imagine how it must have been at
the office for Elon Musk the day after his very
publicly discussed rocket launch failures. His
employees would have totally understood if he had
taken the day off to just gather his thoughts or
relax. But Musk's intense work ethic and powerful
passion to succeed engaged him to still show up
and move on, focusing on what needed to be
accomplished to ensure that the next launch would
succeed.
Successful entrepreneurs never stop learning, and
Musk is the best example of this characteristic.
Jim Cantrell, the first vice-president for
business development at SpaceX and one of Musk’s
first aerospace consultants, saw with his own eyes
how Musk devoured several textbooks at a time to
learn about rocket science. Despite his busy
schedule running different businesses, Musk would
set aside time to read books lent to him by
Cantrell, such as Rocket Propulsion Elements,
Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket
Propulsion, or International Reference Guide to
Space Launch Systems . He did not just read the
books, but even quoted passages from them. “He
became very conversant in the material," Cantrell
said.
This love for reading, of course, was developed in
Musk while he was a child, as can be attested to
by his brother Kimbal. As a child, Elon read close
to two books every day on a wide range of
subjects, such as computer programming, science
fiction, religion, and biographies of successful
business people and scientists. He loved books
that tackled physics, technology, product design,
and business management. It is no surprise, then,
that Musk has reached the pinnacle of success
where he is today. He invested in reading and
learning, and did not stop even as he got older
and became busy with different things.
If you aspire to become a great leader just like
Musk, openness to learning is a critical
requirement. Leaders and entrepreneurs cannot
afford to sit on their laurels and just bask in
past achievements. Successful people like Musk
never cease exploring new ideas, discovering new
perspectives, and experimenting with new processes
that widen one's knowledge and expand the horizons
beyond what is already known. The best learners
also transform into the best leaders, as you can
plainly see in the life of Elon Musk.
The best part about studying the life of Musk is
the fact that he is still at the prime of his
career. With all the notable milestones he has
already reached, he still has so many dreams, and
he has barely scratched the surface of what he
really wants to achieve. Many followers lovingly
refer to him as the real-world version of Tony
Stark from the Marvel universe, and like the
beloved character, the whole world is waiting to
see what Musk will do next. His plans, outrageous
though some of them may seem at the moment, could
very well be the driving force of innovation
within just a few years. From what it looks like,
Musk is determined to take on the world and the
universe beyond, and all of us will be taken along
for the ride.
Now it is up to you to decide whether you will
take Musk’s life lessons and apply them to your
own journey, or be content to just be a spectator.
Are you willing to invest the same amount of
commitment, passion, work ethic, self-learning,
and risk as he is in his endeavors? The world is
constantly in need of entrepreneurs, leaders, and
innovators just like Musk who are willing to lay
it all on the line and commit to positive
transformation.
Too many are content to just sit on the sidelines
and live mundane, ordinary lives. But true success
comes to those who are ready to seize new
opportunities and become agents of change. It is
not just about personal gain, but about finding
your place in the world and leaving a legacy that
future generations will still benefit from, long
after you are gone.

Chapter Seven: 40 Little Known Facts
1. Like many famous entrepreneurs, including Steve
Jobs, Musk’s salary at Tesla Motors is the very
modest sum of $1.
2. The Musk foundation is a group set up by Elon
Musk that is dedicated to discovering clean energy
sources and space exploration. The Musk Mars
Desert Observatory telescope in Utah is run by the
foundation.
3. The Musk Foundation also runs a simulated Mars
environment that allows visitors to experience
what life on Mars could be like. Including wasteburning
toilets!
4. Wet Nellie, the Lotus Esprit submarine car from
the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, was
purchased by Musk in 2013 for $866,000.
Disappointed that the car can’t actually turn into
a submarine Musk stated: “What I’m going to do is
upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and
try to make it transform for real.”
5. It was only at the age of 31, in 2002, that
Musk became an American citizen.
6. Musk once proposed nuking Mars. During an
appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,
he was asked his potential ideas regarding
colonizing Mars. He replied: “Eventually, you
could transform Mars into an Earth-like planet...
You could warm it up.” When Colbert asked him to
elaborate, Musk said, “There’s the fast way and
the slow way. The fast way is drop thermonuclear
weapons over the poles.” He later clarified that
this idea was to create two suns nears Mars due to
nuclear fusion.
7. The National Highway Safety Administration
awarded the Tesla Model S a 5.4 out of 5 safety
rating. The highest ever given to an automobile.
8. At 41, Musk had surgery to fix a deviated
septum due to the violent childhood bullying he
suffered. During his recovery, while full of
painkillers, he was tweeting his future ideas
about Tesla.
9. Musk has managed to reduce the cost of reaching
the International Space Station down from $1
billion per mission to $60 million. A very
impressive decrease in cost of 90%!
10. The Falcon rocket gets its name from Star
Wars' Millennium Falcon.
11. Musk was one of the inspirations for Robert
Downey Jr.’s character, Tony Stark, in the Iron
Man films. Downey had a tour of the SpaceX
headquarters prior to filming and absorbed some of
what he would call “accessible eccentricities.”
Jon Favreau, the director, also explained that
Musk had inspired Downey’s interpretation of the
character. Musk earned himself a cameo in Iron Man
2.
12. Early on in his career he purchased an F1
McLaren as a reward for the sale of Zip2. He later
went on to create the Tesla Model S, a car that
can reach 0-60 mph even quicker.
13. He has been married three times, including
twice to the British actress Talulah Riley.
14. After an expensive divorce from his first wife
and during the Great Recession, Musk was living
off loans from friends. He put his last $35
million into Tesla which is now valued at around
$50 billion. Musk himself is now estimated to be
worth $19.3 billion.
15. He once made a guest appearance on The Big
Bang Theory. The scene takes place in a soup
kitchen on Thanksgiving and Musk is washing
dishes.
16. He also made a guest appearance on The
Simpsons, playing himself.
17. During a Reddit AMA in 2015, one user asked
about his learning process. Musk used a tree
analogy to explain: “I do kinda feel like my head
is full! My context switching penalty is high and
my process isolation is not what it used to be.
Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a
lot more than they think they can. They sell
themselves short without trying. One bit of
advice: It is important to view knowledge as sort
of a semantic tree —make sure you understand the
fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big
branches, before you get into the leaves/details
or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”
18. Musk has five sons (one set of twins and one
set of triplets), whom he shares custody of with
his first wife, Canadian fantasy author Justine
Wilson.
19. He has confessed to naming one of his sons,
Xavier, after Professor Xavier of the X-Men.
20. As a child, Musk would often gaze into the
distance while his parents were talking to him.
This led them to believe he may be deaf and he
even had his adenoids removed. It made no
difference as it turned out he was just
daydreaming. His mother explained: “He goes into
his brain, and then you just see he is in another
world. ... Now I just leave him be because I know
he is designing a new rocket or something.”
21. Musk owns five mansions in the Southern
Californian upmarket neighborhood of Bel Air.
Totaling a value of more than $70 million, Musk
ensured they are all eco-friendly covering each
one in solar panels.
22. He believes humanity’s biggest threat is
Artificial Intelligence. Musk worries that AI
could become too intelligent to handle and
eventually wipe out mankind. In an interview
with Vanity Fair, Musk explained that it’s
technically not a robot that would become too
powerful, but a computer algorithm. “The important
thing is that if we do get some sort of runaway
algorithm, then the human AI collective can stop
the runaway algorithm. But if there’s a large,
centralized AI that decides, then there’s no
stopping it.”
23. In hope of combatting the threat of AI, Musk
launched Neuralink. This ambitious venture hopes
to eventually implant computers in human brains to
ward off any threat of AI. He also co-founded
OpenAI in 2015. OpenAI is a nonprofit whose sole
purpose is to carry out research that ensures AI
doesn’t destroy mankind.
24. Esquire magazine named Musk one of the 75 most
influential people of the 21st century.
25. When it comes to humor, many are surprised to
discover Musk has a raunchy approach. When naming
the Tesla Model 3, Musk originally wanted to call
it the Model E for what he described as “dumb
obvious humor reasons.” If he’d had his way, the
cars would be Models S, E and X. Unfortunately,
due to a Ford trademark lawsuit, Musk had to
settle for the Model 3 instead.
26. Musk stated his primary reason for starting
Tesla Motors and SolarCity was to fight global
warming and work towards a more sustainable
future.
27. Earlier in life, Musk would drink eight cans
of Diet Coke and several cups of coffee a day. It
was how he used to cope with 100-hour work weeks
during the process of setting up and running new
companies. He once stated that while following
this routine: "I got so freaking jacked that I
seriously started to feel like I was losing my
peripheral vision.”
28. Fortune named Musk “Business Person of the
Year” in 2013.
29. A user on Reddit once asked him, “What daily
habit do you believe has the largest positive
impact on your life?” Musk didn't respond with one
of the usual suspects—waking up early, expressing
gratitude, meditating - but “showering.”
30. After moving from South Africa to Canada, a
young Elon Musk was broke. He would often only
spend $1 a day, living on a diet consisting of hot
dogs and oranges.
31. Despite Musk’s obvious current success, it
almost didn’t turn out this way. The Roadster,
Tesla’s first electric car, faced constant
production problems and SpaceX had three launch
failures before the fourth and final effort was a
success.
32. SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft is the first
commercial vehicle to attach to the International
Space Station.
33. Musk has the ambitious plan to cover the world
with space-based internet. Through SpaceX, he
plans to launch 4,425 satellites into orbit that
would provide internet coverage all around the
world. Currently there are only just over 4,000
satellites (active and inactive) in orbit.
34. Along with Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Mark
Zuckerberg, Sir Richard Branson and many others,
Elon Musk has signed the giving pledge. This is a
promise to eventually donate the majority of his
wealth to philanthropic causes.
35. Musk is often referred to as a
“thrillionaire.” This is a new class of high-tech
entrepreneurs looking to use their wealth to make
science-fiction dreams into a modern reality.
36. Musk was awarded the FAI Gold Space Medal by
the Federation Aronautique Internationale for
designing the first privately developed rocket to
reach orbit. This award is the organization’s most
significant and has also been awarded to Neil
Armstrong.
37. Musk has developed an idea for a “fifth mode
of transport.” The Hyperloop – an underground high
speed transit tube. Speaking in an interview, Musk
claims, “It would never crash, it would be immune
to weather and it would get passengers from Los
Angeles to San Francisco in under 30 minutes. It
would be energy efficient, maybe even selfpowering
with help from solar panels, which would
keep costs well below an airline ticket.”
38. Musk doesn’t actually have a proper desk. When
speaking of his working environment, he explains,
“I always move my desk to wherever—I don’t really
have a desk actually—I move myself to wherever the
biggest problem is in Tesla. I really believe that
one should lead from the front lines, and that’s
why I’m here.”
39. Musk believes he will be the first private
citizen to pioneer outer space. He also believes
that the journey will cost lives. Speaking to
Esquire, he stated that “there will probably be a
lot of people that die in the process.”
40. It is no secret that Musk plans to eventually
colonize Mars. Not too many people know what the
Mars Colonial Transporters are called though. Musk
recently revealed that their codenames are BFR
(‘Big F***ing Rocket’) and BFS (‘Big F***ing
Spaceship’)!

"A company is a group organized to create a
product or service, and it is only as good as its
people and how excited they are about creating. I
do want to recognize a ton of super-talented
people. I just happen to be the face of the
companies."
"People work better when they know what the goal
is and why. It is important that people look
forward to coming to work in the morning and enjoy
working."
"I say something, and then it usually happens.
Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens."
"I do think there is a lot of potential if you
have a compelling product and people are willing
to pay a premium for that. I think that is what
Apple has shown. You can buy a much cheaper cell
phone or laptop, but Apple's product is so much
better than the alternative, and people are
willing to pay that premium."
"I don't spend my time pontificating about highconcept
things; I spend my time solving
engineering and manufacturing problems."
"I always invest my own money in the companies
that I create. I don't believe in the whole thing
of just using other people's money. I don't think
that's right. I'm not going to ask other people to
invest in something if I'm not prepared to do so
myself."
"My biggest mistake is probably weighing too much
on someone's talent and not someone's personality.
I think it matters whether someone has a good
heart."
"I don't believe in process. In fact, when I
interview a potential employee and he or she says
that 'it's all about the process,' I see that as a
bad sign. The problem is that at a lot of big
companies, process becomes a substitute for
thinking. You're encouraged to behave like a
little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it
allows you to keep people who aren't that
smart, who aren't that creative."
"Starting and growing a business is as much about
the innovation, drive, and determination of the
people behind it as the product they sell."
"The first step is to establish that something is
possible; then probability will occur."
"There are really two things that have to occur in
order for a new technology to be affordable to the
mass market. One is you need economies of scale.
The other is you need to iterate on the design.
You need to go through a few versions."
"Talent is extremely important. It's like a sports
team, the team that has the best individual player
will often win, but then there's a multiplier from
how those players work together and the strategy
they employ."
"Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80
to 100 hour weeks every week. [This]improves the
odds of success. If other people are putting in 40
hour workweeks and you're putting in 100 hour
workweeks, then even if you're doing the same
thing, you know that you will achieve in four
months what it takes them a year to achieve."
"I've actually not read any books on time
management."
"I'm interested in things that change the world or
that affect the future and wondrous, new
technology where you see it, and you're like,
'Wow, how did that even happen? How is that
possible?'"
"Really pay attention to negative feedback and
solicit it, particularly from friends. ... Hardly
anyone does that, and it's incredibly helpful."
"If you get up in the morning and think the future
is going to be better, it is a bright day.
Otherwise, it's not."
"What makes innovative thinking happen?... I think
it's really a mindset. You have to decide."
"People should pursue what they're passionate
about. That will make them happier than pretty
much anything else."
"I wouldn't say I have a lack of fear. In fact,
I'd like my fear emotion to be less because it's
very distracting and fries my nervous system."
"If you're trying to create a company, it's like
baking a cake. You have to have all the
ingredients in the right proportion."
"I think most of the important stuff on the
Internet has been built. There will be continued
innovation, for sure, but the great problems of
the Internet have essentially been solved."
"I think we have a duty to maintain the light of
consciousness to make sure it continues into the
future."
"When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars, people
said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a
huge bet he made, and it worked."
"When somebody has a breakthrough innovation, it
is rarely one little thing. Very rarely, is it one
little thing. It's usually a whole bunch of things
that collectively amount to a huge innovation."
"You shouldn't do things differently just because
they're different. They need to be... better."
"I would just question things... It would
infuriate my parents... That I wouldn't just
believe them when they said something 'cause I'd
ask them why. And then I'd consider whether that
response made sense given everything else I knew."
"It's very important to like the people you work
with, otherwise life [and] your job is gonna be
quite miserable."
"We have a strict 'no-assholes policy' at SpaceX."
"Disruptive technology where you really have a big
technology discontinuity... tends to come from new
companies."
"As much as possible, avoid hiring MBAs. MBA
programs don't teach people how to create
companies."
"Don't delude yourself into thinking something's
working when it's not, or you're gonna get fixated
on a bad solution."
"If something has to be designed and invented, and
you have to figure out how to ensure that the
value of the thing you create is greater than the
cost of the inputs, then that is probably my core
skill."
"I always have optimism, but I'm realistic. It was
not with the expectation of great success that I
started Tesla or SpaceX... It's just that I
thought they were important enough to do anyway.
“Going from PayPal, I thought: ‘Well, what are
some of the other problems that are likely to most
affect the future of humanity?’ Not from the
perspective, ‘What’s the best way to make money?”
“(Physics is) a good framework for thinking. ...
Boil things down to their fundamental truths and
reason up from there.”
“You want to have a future where you’re expecting
things to be better, not one where you’re
expecting things to be worse.”
“You have to be pretty driven to make it happen.
Otherwise, you will just make yourself miserable.”
“If you go back a few hundred years, what we take
for granted today would seem like magic – being
able to talk to people over long distances, to
transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of
data like an oracle. These are all things that
would have been considered magic a few hundred
years ago.”
“Let’s think beyond the normal stuff and have an
environment where that sort of thinking is
encouraged and rewarded and where it’s okay to
fail as well. Because when you try new things, you
try this idea, that idea... well a large number of
them are not gonna work, and that has to be okay.
If every time somebody comes up with an idea it
has to be successful, you’re not gonna get people
coming up with ideas.”
“I came to the conclusion that we should aspire to
increase the scope and scale of human
consciousness in order to better understand what
questions to ask. Really, the only thing that
makes sense is to strive for greater collective
enlightenment.”
“Patience is a virtue, and I’m learning patience.
It’s a tough lesson.”
“When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in
things that would change the world. Now I am.”
“I think it’s very important to have a feedback
loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what
you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.
I think that’s the single best piece of advice:
constantly think about how you could be doing
things better and questioning yourself.”
“Life is too short for long-term grudges.”
“I think life on Earth must be about more than
just solving problems... It’s got to be something
inspiring, even if it is vicarious.”
“The idea of lying on a beach as my main thing
just sounds like the worst. It sounds horrible to
me. I would go bonkers. I would have to be on
serious drugs. I’d be super-duper bored. I like
high intensity.”
“Don’t be afraid of new arenas.”
“I think it is possible for ordinary people to
choose to be extraordinary.”
“I could either watch it happen or be a part of
it.”
“Being an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and
staring into the abyss of death”
Chapter Nine: Elon Musk’s 15 Rules For Success
Work Ridiculously Hard .
Musk is known for his fierce work ethic. Even
present day as a global superstar he is still
putting in 100-hour work weeks, splitting his time
between Tesla and SpaceX. Back when Elon and his
brother co-founded PayPal, they would sleep in the
office and shower at the local YMCA. He believes
this is the bedrock to his success and there is no
getting around it.
“Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80
to 100 hour weeks every week. [This] improves the
odds of success. If other people are putting in 40
hour work weeks and you’re putting in 100 hour
work weeks, then even if you’re doing the same
thing you know that... you will achieve in 4
months what it takes them a year to achieve.”
Be a Trendsetter.
Instead of competing with others in well
established markets, Musk prefers to solve
problems in emerging markets that have little
competition. During it’s early years, PayPal was
the only email money transferring system in the
world. Tesla was created just as electric cars
were being written off and SpaceX is the first
private company to send a spacecraft to the
International Space Station.
Focus on innovation instead of competition. If you
innovate correctly, there will be no competition.
Creating a monopoly leads to lasting value and
reaps the majority of the rewards available in
that particular market segment.
Make Failure an Option.
“Failure is an option here. If things are not
failing, you are not innovating enough.”
Originally, Musk believed Tesla would fail. Why
would he start a company he believed almost
certain to fail? Musk’s answer:
“If something is important enough you should try
even if the probable outcome is failure.”
Electric cars were seen as slow and ugly. Musk
took on the difficult task of changing almost the
entire populations opinion on them. It was no easy
feat but the introduction The Tesla Model S
achieved this topping Consumer Reports’ annual
customer satisfaction ratings two years in a row.
Focus on Work that is Important to You.
At the age of 27 Elon sold Zip2 to Compaq for $307
million dollars. He personally netted $22 million
dollars from the sale, quite easily enough to
retire on. Instead he decided to continue on,
working harder than ever because he recognizes the
importance of his work and how he his changing the
world in the process. Working on projects that are
important to you can provide the best of both
worlds - financial rewards and job satisfaction.
Focus on Signal over Noise.
Musk firmly believes the quality of the product or
service should always come first. An amazing
product is the best type of marketing there is. In
his commencement speech at USC in 2014, Musk
states:
“A lot of companies spend money on things that
don’t actually make the product better. For
example, at Tesla we’ve never spent any money on
advertising. We put all the money into R+D, and
manufacturing and design to try to make the car as
good as possible. And I think that’s the way to
go. For any given company just keep thinking ‘are
the efforts that people are expending resulting in
a better product or service?’ If they’re not –
stop those efforts.”
Create a superior product above all else.
Seek out Constructive Criticism.
Nobody enjoys to have their work criticized as it
can often feel like a personal attack upon
yourself. Musk is able to take his ego out of the
equation and realize that constructive criticism
is essential to improvement. Through seeking out
this information you gain valuable information
from a whole set of fresh eyes as to which areas
need to be improved. Musk expands upon this point
in an interview he gave.
“I think it’s important for people to pay close
attention to negative feedback and rather than
ignore negative feedback, you have to listen to it
carefully. Ignore it if the underlying reason for
the negative feedback doesn’t make sense but
otherwise, people should adjust their behavior.
I’m not perfect at it, for sure, but I do think
it’s really important to solicit negative
feedback, particularly from people who have your
best interest in mind.”
Attract Great People
A company is just a group of people working
together to create a service or product. During
his commencement speech at USC, Musk stated that
the most important part of creating a company is
to attract the right people. He further explains,
“depending upon how talented and hardworking that
group is, and the degree to which they’re focused
cohesively in a good direction, that will
determine the success of the company. So do
everything you can to gather great people if
you’re creating a company.” If you have no desire
in creating a company Musk instead advises, “Join
a group that is amazing that you really respect.”
Invest Profits into new Businesses.
Whenever Musk cashes in on one of his companies
for millions, he has always invested at least 45%
of his earnings into a brand new business within a
12-month period. After banking $22 million for the
sale of Zip2, Musk invested $10 million into
creating X.com (eventually PayPal). The sale of
PayPal netted Musk a cool $165 million, he would
go on to invest $100 million of that into the
founding of SpaceX. Musk never believes he has
‘made it’, each success is just a stepping stone
onto bigger and more important challenges.
Be Tenacious.
Tenacious Definition: Adjective. Not readily
relinquishing a position, principle, or course of
action; determined.
Tesla and SpaceX have both been on the verge of
bankruptcy. The determination shown by Musk is a
big part of the reason they are both now thriving.
The SpaceX Falcon 1 launch was initially a
success, the vehicle made it through the most
complex stage of breaking away from Earth’s
gravitational pull. Soon after, the rocket failed
and communication was lost. The mission was a
failure.
The 300+ individuals in attendance who had worked
on the project thought it was game over. Musk
promptly stood up and started to speak to the
crowd, reassuring them he had secured more funding
for future launches. He concluded the speech by
proclaiming not what his employees should do, but
what he was going to do. “For my part, I will
never give up... and I mean never.”
As we all know, the next launch was a success.
Reason from First Principles over Analogy.
Large battery packs are expensive to make;
therefore, they will always cost a lot. This is
logical and would be the thinking of most. Not
Musk. Musk believes in stripping things back to
first principles. When you strip back the
components of batteries, (nickel, aluminum,
cobalt, carbon etc.) these are not actually
expensive parts and if made by yourself, costs can
be dramatically reduced. Common thought goes:
“That’s just how it is, always has been and always
will be.” Musk advises us to challenge reality and
to dive deep into the fundamentals.
“I think it’s important to reason from first
principles rather than by analogy. The normal way
we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy.
[With analogy] we are doing this because it’s like
something else that was done, or it is like what
other people are doing. [With first principles]
you boil things down to the most fundamental
truths...and then reason up from there.”
Be Overly Ambitious.
It doesn’t come much more ambitious than planning
to colonize mars. When Musk initially publicized
his plans, most thought he was crazy. After the
success of SpaceX and securing a $1.6 billion
contract with NASA, his plan is starting to look a
lot more realistic. This isn’t just a business
decision for Musk but a potential savior for the
human race. He has revealed he hopes to have
established a colony on Mars by 2040, with a
population of 80,000.
Improvise.
There will always be roadblocks on the road to
success, this is where improvisation is key. When
the Russians wouldn’t sell Elon the
intercontinental ballistic missiles he needed, he
built his own. When SpaceX was told they would
need to wait before launching rockets in the U.S,
he went and found a Pacific island he could use
immediately. When Tesla needed to test a prototype
model in cold conditions, he hired an ice-cream
truck with a big refrigerated trailer. The
problems will always be there, but if you are
willing to improvise, they can nearly always be
overcome.
Begin with a Premium Product.
The strategy Musk used with the creation Tesla was
quite unique, but worked perfectly. Step one
started by creating a premium product to the very
rich with the high end luxury Tesla. This changed
the general view of electric cars being uncool and
slow and the revenues from this model provided the
funds for step two. This was the creation of the
mid-priced, mid-volume produced models which then
produced the funds for the low priced, high volume
cars available for the masses.
Constantly Improve.
Musk believes in the Japanese concept of Kaizen,
translated to constant improvement. When asked
about the single best piece of advice he could
give to someone, Musk advised: “Constantly think
about how you can be doing things better.” The
only thing better than a perfectly executed plan
is perfect execution of a better plan. Start by
finding your drive and refining your execution,
then think about how you can do things better and
question how your plan can be improved.
Take Risks.
All worthwhile achievements come with an element
of risk. Through following the previous 14
principles, risks can be lowered but never wiped
out completely. Greater risks, usually have the
potential to provide greater rewards but you
should always weigh up the pros and cons. When
Musk poured so much of his money into SpaceX and
Tesla, at one point he had to borrow money off
friends just to cover his living expenses. Today
SpaceX, Tesla, and Solar City are thriving and
Elon is several billion dollars wealthier.
Conclusion
The amazing thing about Elon Musk isn’t his
achievements, it’s his persistence through
the failures in his life. He had so many setbacks,
catastrophes, and so much hardship in his life
that it’s amazing to see how he overcame all of
life’s challenges.
That’s what makes Elon Musk. It’s his tenacity ,
determination , and inability to consider
failure that has allowed him to succeed .
