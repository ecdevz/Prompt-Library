I need you to save user data in a simple, flat JSON format. Please avoid nested structures or embedding JSON as string values.
Here's the format I want you to use:

Example of the desired format:

json

{
  "id": "656715c7e5702d37ffe25654",
  "name": "John Dolly 11",
  "email": "johndoe24@example.com", 
  "age": 24
}

Please ensure that each data field is a direct attribute of the main 
JSON object. Avoid structures like this:

sample save json

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "65759db0ebff2e5b1ae69753"
  },
  "name": "popoy",
  "email": "popoy@example.com",
  "hp": 20,
  "mp": 15,
  "__v": 0
}

Remember, the goal is to keep the JSON format straightforward and easily readable, with no nested objects or stringified JSON data. Let's keep the structure clean and simple."
