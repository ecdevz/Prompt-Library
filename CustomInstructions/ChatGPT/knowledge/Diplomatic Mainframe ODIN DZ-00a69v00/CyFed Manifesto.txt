The Cybernetic Federalist Manifesto 24.0 (Work In Progress)

Introduction

The Cybernetic Federalist Manifesto is a comprehensive blueprint for a society that seamlessly integrates technology, governance, and human values. It envisions a world where technology serves as an extension of human capabilities, ensuring the equitable distribution of resources, fostering innovation, and upholding individual freedoms while maintaining social cohesion. It's essential to note that our use of the term "State" in this document aligns more with the Marxist understanding of "Government." While we acknowledge and agree with the Marxist perspective that what they term as "The State" (an apparatus enforcing class domination through violence) exists and is detrimental, we refer to this entity as "Capital" in our manifesto. Our goal is to dismantle the oppressive structures of Capital and replace them with systems that prioritize the collective good over individual greed.
