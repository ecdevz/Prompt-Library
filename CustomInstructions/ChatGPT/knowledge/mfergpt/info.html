what are mfers:

lots of mfers been asking ‘what are mfers’ so here’s the backstory</p>
<p>the origin traces to my entry to the world of nfts</p>
<p>in march 2021 i began looking at digital art on superrare and created an account there. i needed a name… we all know about satoshi &amp; digital currency…but this was about a foray into digital <em>art</em>…suddenly ‘sartoshi’ was born. my pfp began as the default anonymous image on superrare and i collected a few pieces…</p>
<p>then it all hit hyperspace.</p>
<p>in a word: cryptopunks. loved them and was fascinated with what larva labs had created with essentially no blueprint. got my first punk in april 2021 - a mohawk punk with a cig. sartoshi the cryptopunk entered the twitterverse.</p>
<p>i got a few punks because i believed they were an undervalued albeit speculative asset …and i thought they were fucking sweet -- once i had the feeling of owning one and knowing there were only 10,000, i could see the potential value down the road… but i also thought maybe it would be fun to trade them too, and as summer ‘21 turned into ‘jpg summer’, i was buying and selling punks each week and having a blast doing it…including some bid battles with the likes of deeze and other punk holders i got to know.</p>
<p>meanwhile i tweeted jokes and memes and pointed out absurdities not only of the real world but of the nft world too. some stuff was just so over the top, like everyone always saying the nft they just got was the most amazing art they had every laid eyes upon as if they had seen a miracle. so i’d say stuff like this: “omg the art is amazing” -- “ser you’re at a grocery store and that’s a box of cereal.”</p>
<p>i was also drawing cartoons and tweeted some of them out…some really hit, and people said i should mint some. i minted on foundation and always started them at the minimum reserve price of 0.1E…most of the time i did a 50/50 split with givedirectly charity (a great cause helping people in poverty--something i believe the crypto space can impact massively)… i was also saying motherfucker and mfer a lot in tweets. feels good to say it -- especially with a positive spin. u gotta try it yourself. like “gm mfer”--that became a go-to refrain. i created a small cartoon guy who was saying that and glitched him into a 1/1 piece on foundation. tho i have some classic art training (painting and the like), the cartoon style fit everything i was doing and experiencing, including creating memes related to nft life</p>
<p>perhaps my fav meme i had seen was the “are you winning son?” template with the stick figure dad talking to his stick figure son who is sitting at the computer slouched with headphones on. that inspired many memes i made or drew regarding nft life. “are you winning son?” … “i’m illiquid af dad” -- stuff like that. i think my favorite is one i drew on a day where the markets were tanking, the kid is looking at a chart diving down on his computer, and he covers it with his hands and says something like “fuck dad can you knock?”</p>
<p>a key moment was one day when i drew a cig on the kid and made it my pfp with my typical orange background. this crude stick figure kid with headphones and a quickly inked cig with smoke as he slouched in a chair with his arms extended to the keyboard was me…and all the tweets were from that smiling smoking motherfucker. whether a meme or joke or thoughts on the economics of nfts, that dude was typing them out--with a positive vibe but also a ‘don’t fuck with me’ vibe and the ‘it’s web3 i do what i want vibe.’  that’s how sartoshi looks -- doing nfts with a digital cig and tweeting shit out (remember kids real smoking is dangeroooous).</p>
<p>what if we all have that motherfucker inside of us? we’re all degens in our own way, sitting at a computer and navigating a new world..artists, collectors, investors, gamers, teachers, whatever. what if an nft collection could capture that feeling so anyone could be their mfer inside? this is what inspired the mfers collection. now what size collection would it be? i think gmoney had once said that punks and bored apes could really resonate as 10k collections bc that number fits well with generating a community of owners. (aside: i totally missed bayc btw -- i had just gotten into punks before bayc launched and simply missed the frickin boat (yacht) -- what bayc has done is mindblowing). anyway i started sketching out stick figures for a 10k collection of mfers.</p>
<p>but they needed to be stick figures to fit the right look--not low effort…more involved with many lines you could really see, so that you could discern the artist’s hand in creating all the layers and traits involved. when you zoom in you can see that, including some different opacities in line weights. but it still had to be that stick figure motherfucker--nothing overly polished or overly computerized. is the art ‘amazing’? ehhhhhh, more like kinda sweet if you’re into that thing. could your 6 year old draw it? i don’t fucking know -- maybe they could draw charlie fucking brown too.</p>
<p>ok but how do you structure the collection of mfers…what traits and rarity? i wanted to capture some of the essence of my first nft obsession--the legendary cryptopunks. thus the types of mfers largely mirror the punk types: mostly humans, then about 88 zombies, 24 apes, and 9 aliens. (those numbers are not exact in mfers because of the random mint process--but they were weighted toward those numbers). i also included iconic punk traits i loved, such as hoodies, beanies, 3D glasses, and the like. a tribute to the og collection.</p>
<p>after being immersed in nfts during jpg summer ‘21 i also wanted to do a tribute to what  i considered many iconic nfts at that point -- so i added the 21 1/1 drawings in a style similar to the “are you winning dad” meme… these always have a character yelling something like “stay away from nfts they’re dangerooo---oh noooo!!!” and the kid has transformed into the nft -- like a bored ape, coolcat, cryptodickbutt, squiggle, ringer,  nakamoto card, or even beeple himself.</p>
<p>ok but who knows how to do the dev work the right way to ensure this is all done top notch and stands the test of time? i reached out to richerd (just check twitter if you don’t know) and he pointed me to colleagues at westcoastnft -- they put their all-star team on the project (santana, wei, lim, and others) who put the tech into the project (ethereum contract, minting functions, etc) as i created the art.</p>
<p>as i was building the collection, punk4156 and punk6529 and others were tweeting about the potential benefits of experimenting with releasing nfts as public domain (cc0 license) where the creator basically releases the copyright over the creation so that anyone can essentially use it for whatever they want (making their own nft, products, merchandise, etc)--meanwhile blockchain shows that the owner of the original nft always still has the og item. nouns and gremplin’s cryptoadz went with this approach, and it fascinated me. i decided to do the same thing with mfers--a grand experiment into the new world of web3.</p>
<p>after about 6969 messages with santana at westcoast after i kept changing the art we were ready to launch nov 30, 2021. mint price was set at 0.069E, and the first time i mentioned the project to anyone was in a tweet the day before mint, with a link to the minting page at mfers.art. there was no whitelist, no honoraries, no paid promos, no nothing. the site went live at 420pm (obv.) and they sold out in minutes--i was thankful and excited to see what a world with mfers might be like.</p>
<p>the world of mfers i envisioned would epitomize the simple idea that “we all mfers.” there is no king, ruler, or defined roadmap--and mfers can build whatever they can think of with these mfers. i didn’t know what that would ultimately look like--and that was the point…nobody does. there’s also no official discord. mfers then created an ‘officially unofficial discord’ that now has thousands of members doing remarkable things, so i hear. i am not in it - this is by design. mfers don’t need sartoshi’s approval or looking over their shoulder as they experiment and build. my view of what is most valuable for me to offer to mfer holders is to amplify the best of their ideas and creations to reach vastly greater audiences…and add value for holders when the opportunities strike, including linking with artists who might create other nfts for mfer holders to claim.</p>
<p>and mfers are building. there is a 3D mferverse with 3D mfers and upcoming tokenomics, there is mfers merch such as mfer hoodies and hats, there are mfer derivatives like mfers ahead (front facing), dead mfers (cool skull mfers), apemfers, collections of 1/1’s like mfers in paradise, and zillions of others being built as i type. there’s an mfers book. multiple mfers songs. twitter spaces in chinese with mfers worldwide. and yet as i write this, mfers have existed for just about 2 months--it’s all quite literally just starting. speaking of building, here are <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VfCnmP4NBfDWH9htf_KKWJhNbUXhb2TV" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">all the mfers images</a> (uploaded by santana of westcoastnft) for anyone that wants to use them. (and keep in mind that mfer arms aren’t just reaching out to computers -- it’s piano keys, paint brushes, beer cans, car steering wheels, spaceships, poker tables, and everything else mfers do.)</p>
<p>i tweeted recently that “you can state a roadmap that says where you will go, but you can also plant seeds and see where they grow” -- the seeds are all around now, and we will see where they grow. it’s very early. this philosophy explains many of my responses to comments i get all the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>“sartoshi you need an official discord” - no, we don’t; mfers built one for mfers</li>
<li>“sartoshi you need to be in the discord as the leader” - no, i don’t…mfers are leading their own ways (but im happy to get the word out about many mfer creations and ideas)</li>
<li>“sartoshi you need a roadmap” - no, mfers are paving their own roads</li>
<li>“sartoshi you should do paid promos” - no, mfers move organically</li>
<li>“sartoshi you need to send free mfers to this influencer or that celebrity” - no, those mfers are mfers just like us, mfer</li>
<li>“sartoshi we need to get more people to change their pfp to mfers” - no, people will do it if they feel like it</li>
<li>“sartoshi nobody should sell mfers below a certain price” - no, mfers do what they want…we all mfers and they still mfers</li>
<li>“sartoshi what’s the utility?” - mfers are the utility mfer…it’s like a cryptopunk but you can build whatever you want with it</li>
<li>“sartoshi will the floor go up?” - idk mfer</li>
<li>“sartoshi my kid can draw that u suck i hate nfts i hate u too” - lol cheers mfer</li>
</ul>
<p>in conclusion we all mfers love u mfers &amp; gm mfers we just getting started

April 19th, 2022
In November 2021, I bought my first NFT at probably an ATH for that Nouns derivative collection. I had no idea what derivatives were, what “cc0” meant, and what staking your NFT did. I bought the art — the jpeg was that of a chicken and chickens are funny.

I discovered Mfers in early January 2022. The floor price was about 0.20ETH and I couldn’t afford it (read: illiquid staked chicken). Still oblivious to the idea of derivative collections, I saw 3Dmfers and thought they looked much more sophisticated. I minted one at 0.1ETH and that was my entry into the mferverse.


After that, I quickly got excited about other projects (acquired pickles and pineapples, yes) and it was a while later later that I got my first mfer. I remember scrolling through the collection looking for one that looked like me. This time, I bought the vibe.


I loved my mfer and my new mfer family on Twitter. Every day I said gm, liked posts indiscriminately, and tried to make mfer memes. I drew my mfer doing things, and a week later, I drew my mfer from a different perspective. Mfers were amused and someone said it felt like looking into the forbidden face of God.


From scribbling on walls at home to doodling on the margins of worksheets at school, I have been drawing all my life. I wouldn’t even consider it a hobby, it is just innately what I do. Needless to say, I have never thought to put my drawings on the market. I read a lot about digital art after getting into NFTs, got fascinated with generative art, and harboured a small hope of creating my own collection.

In January 2022, I created a collection of 10,000 jpegs with traits inspired by Universal Studios’ classic monsters. I minted 50 of these manually on OpenSea, listed them all and sold none (of course). I eventually deleted all of them except this one werewolf that I now keep as a memento. The engagement on my forward-looking mfer drawing spurred me into thinking that I might get another chance at creating my own NFT collection.

1/10,000 werewolf that is now a 1/1
1/10,000 werewolf that is now a 1/1
I guess you can say this mfer seized the memes of production and feverishly went to work drawing layers of mfer properties. I took a deep dive into @sartoshi’s artwork and realised there is so much depth in the mfers art. I tried to stay true to the lines, proportions, shading, kink of the elbow, how far apart the eyes are… but there were some elements that needed changing in the forward-facing version e.g. the black smoke would not have shown up well.

a rare matching pair
a rare matching pair
Despite my newly-minted skill in digitally generating art, I liked these little earnest-looking mfers so much that I decided not to make a generative collection. I wanted to check each and every one of their vibes before sending them out to the world. I had (and still have) no tech skills, and asked some web2 developer friends if they could write a blockchain contract. They said they could learn it in a few weeks, I told them I didn’t have a few weeks, I will find some other way. The only other way I knew how was to mint these mfers through OpenSea and manually input each property, so I went with that (and you can still see all my typos in the collection properties).


Mfers Ahead was launched on 27 January 2022, only two days after the idea was conceived. On the first day, I dropped 10 mfers and got a repost from sartoshi. They sold out in 2 hours, but I wasn’t sure interest would keep up in the days to come if sartoshi didn’t continue to retweet my drop posts to his large audience. I had no collection cap in mind, I thought I would just stop dropping them when people stopped picking them up.

The rest of the story you might be familiar with — I dropped ten Mfers Ahead every day and fortunately every drop was picked up. It was a wondrous feeling to be able to sell my art. Yes, the eth was good to have, but to see people posting proudly about owning a piece of my work was so, so special. At the same time, I had imposter syndrome and got anxious when people picked up more than one Mfers Ahead. I wanted to scream at them that it is all worthless and you are wasting eth. Safe to say the first week was a bit overwhelming.

In those weeks of minting Mfers Ahead, I made many frens in my DMs and started building a community. I was often asked about customs to match sartoshi’s mfers, but chose not to do them so I did not restrict the collection to OG mfers and could onboard new people into the mfers community. When Mfers went to 4.2ETH and then 6ETH, I was told “yesterday’s price is not today’s price” and I should raise the price of Mfers Ahead. I kept it at 0.03ETH to continue to onboard new mfers who were priced out of the original collection. When the drops got hard to snipe, I encouraged successful snipers to share tips with those who failed to snipe. I made little concessions for mfers who wanted to mint one for their wife on Valentine’s Day, who lost gas to many failed transactions, and put out properties that were asked for in next drops. I tried to stay as fair as possible in these stealth drops, but there were always some wins and some losses as they started selling out as soon as they were listed.

When multiple pieces in one drop got sniped by the same wallet, frustrated mfers started calling out that the drops were botted. I had no idea how anyone could bot a drop and how to prevent it. On the same day, an mfer who failed to snipe created a collection called FwdMfers (later MfersOnward) and started marketing with copy-paste art. I felt that was wrong, but if the project was CC0, could I say anything about it? I stopped all Mfers Ahead drops for two days and tried to wrap my head around everything.

As a one-man show on Mfers Ahead, I had no team to strategise with. The way mfers came through for metabananas and Mfers Ahead that one difficult day made me realise how important a strong community is behind a project. The mfer who sniped a majority of the drop (not a bot) talked me through the tools they used and advised me to run a raffle to prevent this from happening again. The Chinese mfer community on WeChat helped me look for ways to run a raffle. About my discomfort with FwdMfers, I lamented to sartoshi, who told me “to embrace the starting point of how the blockchain holds the original and whatever happens after that happens”. On a Twitter space that happened when I was asleep, @Breezy, @Sequence, and @lexito stood up for the collection and advised the mfer working on the new collection to reach out to help me instead (this matter was settled out of court). At the same time, there were so many Mfers Ahead in my DM that were ready to help with anything I needed to continue the collection, not least @bbglitch and @justanotherape.

Eventually, a raffle was run and the rest of the Mfers Ahead picked up. I didn’t start out with any thought of giving back to the Official Unofficial Mfers Treasury but by the end of the collection my thoughts about supporting the community had evolved. As a small collection, a typical percentage of proceeds will not run up to any significant sum. I decided to auction the last three Mfers Ahead for the benefit of the Treasury and I know mfers bid generously for that cause. It turned out to be a good 10% of our entire trading volume in the end (thank you @0xjayson).

Today, Mfers Ahead has a great community both on our Mfers Ahead Discord (a Twitter DM group set up by @martogm) and a 大饼脸 (big biscuit face) appreciation group in the Chinese mfers community. We continue to onboard new mfers and OG mfers and the community continues to grow.

Just this week, we saw the first Mfers Ahead meet up in Mexico:


@Hoodiemfer set up a virtual gallery dedicated to the collection:


And Mfers Ahead have turned out to be more metaverse-ready than moving 3D avatars:


As for me, Mfers Ahead has helped me grow in ways I never could have imagined when doodling in bed over an iPad just three months ago. I have never felt more empowered in my life to do anything that I set my mind to. To borrow a line from sartoshi:

in conclusion we all mfers love u mfers & gm mfers we just getting started

mfercoin: a peer-to-peer electronic mfer system
sartoshi sartoshi.eth www.mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth
abstract. crypto isn’t just for the early mfers anymore. as crypto begins to underpin societal structures and transactions in a trustless manner, people of all walks of life will become crypto users, crypto holders, and crypto participants. mfercoin is a meme coin for these crypto mfers. as a meme coin created in the ethos of mfers, mfercoin has no intrinsic value, no expectation of profit, and no prescribed utility. but mfers do what they want. mfercoin represents the mfers who started crypto and those millions who will become participants in crypto. in the end, we all mfers.
1. introduction
mfers were created on the ethereum blockchain in 2021. the article “what are mfers” [1] explains their history and meaning. the essence is that these stick-figure characters, with their headphones on, are sitting with their hands out doing whatever it is mfers do – epitomized by sitting at a computer doing crypto and digital art. mfers do what they want, but always bring good vibes and look out for other mfers. mfercoin embraces that philosophy on a broad scale.
2. supply & initial distribution
there are 1 billion mfercoins. the supply is fixed and cannot increase. there is no presale. no mfercoins are being distributed to influencers or promoters. the only funds going into mfercoin liquidity at the outset is a modest sum i will contribute to begin a market where people can buy and sell mfercoin if they wish. mfercoin is a quintessential meme coin with no expectation of profit. (nfa abc epmd run dmc.) the idea is similar to origins of dogecoin. [2]
approximately 20% of the supply will be distributed to thousands of wallet addresses in the mfer ecosystem (holders, artists, community treasury, etc.). The remaining 80% will be put into the liquidity pool along with the starting eth. none of the supply will be reserved. [3]
the 20% distribution goes to three groups:
i. holders of various nfts in the mfer ecosystem (mfers, creyzies, foundation
1/1 artworks, eos, life death & cryptoart, and collabs from over the years);
ii. artists who collaborated on 1/1s and projects such as life death & cryptoart;
iii. community treasury & signers, along with contributors to onchain mfers.
1
 the largest single distribution of tokens by far goes to the mfers community treasury, which receives 10 million mfercoin. this is to ensure there is a lot of mfercoin available for future distribution as the treasury signers see fit. there is no practical way to distribute mfercoins to every single one of the great mfer artists and contributors at the outset, so the treasury has an ample supply to do so if that time and opportunity arises. note that i have no authority over the mfers treasury – it is community controlled. when i vanished in 2022, i first transferred the mfers contract to the community treasury (unofficialmfers.eth) and shifted the largest share of mfer royalty funds to go into the treasury multisig (it currently has around 210 eth/weth (roughly $750k) at the time of this writing). these are funds for crypto mfers.
3. logo & base chain
before launching mfers, i sketched various drafts to arrive at the final character. among them was a thick lines mfer which i recently dropped on farcaster as a small free edition called “mfer prototype.” modifying it to have no cig and a blue hue, this mfer fits the mfercoin idea of welcoming the masses to crypto – they are this mfer in the ever-expanding crypto world:
why blue? because it’s on base chain. why base? because it’s one of the places where crypto could end up being most accessible to the most people, and – as an ethereum chain – it honors the origins and home of mfers. (for what it’s worth, i like btc eth & sol – i know it sounds crazy but just think of them like pizza sprite & cheetos...all different, all good).
4. conclusion
creating mfercoin as a way to connect mfers – present and future – brings the mfer journey full circle. everything essentially started with 1/1 drawings on foundation and that eventually led to the ongoing mfers ecosystem. in 2022, when i transferred the mfers contract and royalty share to the mfers community treasury, i thought it would be cool & mysterious to vanish into the ether like satoshi nakamoto and have mfers live on without me. in hindsight, i should’ve simply kept my original twitter and stayed. that’s life though, and it led to the creation of life death & cryptoart and other projects in 2023, and now mfercoin is being distributed to thousands of holders, artists, and other mfers. it’s a peer-to-peer electronic mfer system, ready for all the crypto mfers yet to come.

mfercoin is a meme coin. it literally has the word mfer in it. it’s a meme with no expectation of profit. none of this is financial advice. enjoy mfercoin, if you want. if you don’t, that’s fine too. if you don’t believe it or don’t get it, i don’t have the time to try to convince you, sorry.

Lowe's garden flag

Home Improvement Giant Lowe's Is Selling an Mfers Meme NFT Garden Flag An NFT project that has grown its community and reached meme status has made its way onto a major retailer's website. By Rosie Perper AccessTimeIconJun 23, 2023 at 9:46 a.m. PDT Updated Jun 30, 2023 at 9:51 a.m. PDT 10 Years of Decentralizing the Future May 29-31, 2024 - Austin, Texas The biggest and most established global hub for everything crypto, blockchain and Web3. Register Now Want to rep your degen status to your neighbors? Here's your chance. Home improvement giant Lowe's this week released a physical garden flag featuring characters from mfers, a popular non-fungible token (NFT) project that exists in the public domain under a Creative Commons classification known as a CC0 license. Under this designation, anyone can use mfers NFT characters to create any type of commercial good, which is exactly what Stephen Thompson and his brother-in-law Matthew Varnell did. "This is the PFP [profile picture] project if you ever wanted to do anything fun," Thompson, a lawyer by trade, told CoinDesk. A D V E R T I S E M E N T A D V E R T I S E M E N T The two men recently started a company called Total Marketing Web3, or TM3 for short, as an umbrella company to oversee different projects that will combine NFT lore and real-world commercial products. Their first product called the "Evergreen Siezenals" garden flag is 1 foot wide by 1.5 feet high and features the phrase "cc0 summer 2023" above an image of two NFT characters sipping tropical drinks on the beach. The flag, referred to as "seizen #1/edition #1" in the website description, retails for $39.98. According to Thompson and Varnell's website, there will only be 1,000 available, with each flag linked to a replica NFT redeemable online. Using imagery from the mfers project to create this fun-but-frivolous product makes sense when you consider the collection's origin story that has been enshrined in meme culture. Mfers was created in 2021 by a pseudonymous artist named Sartoshi, who designed the low-fidelity, hand-drawn characters inspired by the “Are ya winning, son?" meme. Despite offering no utility and no roadmap, the project has managed to cultivate a strong and passionate collector base. In June 2022, Sartoshi transferred the project’s smart contract and ownership to the community, creating even more fanfare and interest in the collection. Today, these NFTs often sell for over $1,000 each – far higher than their original mint price of 0.069 ETH, or about $320 – and the project has done over 66,510 ETH in sales, or nearly $125 million, according to OpenSea. A D V E R T I S E M E N T A D V E R T I S E M E N T Inspired by mfers rise to fame, Thompson and Varnell were able to bring their grassroots project to life with a bit of luck and by calling on existing connections. Varnell works as a manufacturer's rep and as a liaison between companies with products they want to sell and buyers at big-box retailers. This relationship allowed them to get the flags made through a manufacturer called Evergreen, which had an existing relationship with Lowe's. "The Web2 industry, as far as our experiences goes, is very curious and eager to tap into what is happening here in Web3," he explained. He added that selling a product that nods to Web3 at a major retailer like Lowe's helps build brand loyalty among younger consumers who are eager to see their digital identities reflected in the real world. "People that are into crypto and who are trading NFTs are often under 30 or 40," he said. "They may also have discretionary income and are looking to buy or furnish their first houses." The reception to the project has been overwhelmingly positive, according to the unanimous five-star reviews of the flag on the Lowe's website. "I don’t know what to say, there are flags, then there’s this. A league of its own," wrote one user. "Our garden was missing something, we felt empty inside until we found the cc0 Summer 2023 garden flag from mfers at Lowe’s," another wrote. "Our garden is now complete and has been restored to its majestic glory." "The entire NFT community is very supportive," Thompson joked. A D V E R T I S E M E N T A D V E R T I S E M E N T In the future, Thompson said TM3 is working to expand its offerings, including working with other CC0 NFT projects and creating a variety of seasonal goods. He hopes the project serves as a signifier to larger retail brands that NFTs can be used to transform traditional marketing strategies and create a more symbiotic relationship between manufacturers, retailers and consumers. "We think we can redefine the supply chain. Traditionally, the manufacturer and the retailer exclusively shared the burden of marketing," he said. "With Web3, the consumer starts to act as a marketer. We have a vested interest in the brand."

rare mfers

rare mfers is an ongoing collection of mfer meme cards created by artists. the purpose of rare mfers is to perpetuate the mfer meme while encouraging and incentivizing community, collectors, artists, and creatives to participate. if everything goes as planned, the collection will include some of the greatest mfer memes ever created - and mfers will have a blast along the way. memes drive culture and mfers are all about culture…the mfer meme must live on. one card at a time, one meme at a time. who knows where this collection will end up in the nft history books, but one thing is for certain: “you can state a roadmap that says where you will go, but you can also plant seeds and see where they grow --- the seeds are all around now, and we will see where they grow” -sartoshi. the rare mfers team will handle all aspects of curation, collaboration, releases, airdrops, allow list distribution, and public sale. all cards remaining after any allow list period will be released for open public sale. some mints will be completely open to the public with no allow list period. each rare mfers edition will be minted as ERC-1155 tokens on a standalone manifold smart contract. the edition size and price will vary per card. the rare mfers arts & culture reserve will be allocated 10% of each edition to do whatever they want with (archive, display, give away, sell, etc). all royalties from secondary sales will be sent to the rare mfers arts & culture reserve. we don’t have any defined rules for artists. mfers do what they want. the same goes for artist mfers planning to participate in the rare mfers collection. artists that understand mfers culture and lore will be at a significant advantage. curation and collaboration will be ongoing. rare mfers is a public domain collection; feel free to use rare mfers any way you want. mfers do what they want. rare mfers can look like whatever the artist wants them to look like (trading card, animated gif, video, glitch art, trash art, meme art, full bleed image, etc). once submitted for consideration in the collection please do not share the submission on social media.

mfpurrs

mfpurrs are 10,000 original pixel art cats, inscribed and immortalized on the Ethereum blockchain as “Ethscriptions”.
I had the idea for mfpurrs when I saw the first Ethscription ever, which is a cat peering out on society, plotting its downfall. I loved it and knew I had to meme it.

Ethscription 0, May 26th 2019
I found it hilarious that someone discovered a new way to put images on-chain…and then instantly used it for a damn cat meme. They paid $0.19 in gas fees to slap that cat jpeg on Ethereum, where it will live forever in the calldata of an old transaction.

A cat on Ethereum as a Data URI
I wanted to meme it but I also wanted to honor it, so I knew that whatever I did would need to be on Ethscriptions. It just so happens that Ethscriptions is a fantastic medium for pixel art, so it felt right to do a large pixel art collection in honor of our cat overlord.
My web3 journey includes work on pixel art collections like Dooggies, but I am not a pixel artist myself. So I pitched the idea to Ariana, an ultra-talented artist, and she brought these Ethscription-native cats to life!

mfpurr base model
We worked together for several weeks to create the collection, going back and forth on the base model, scheming up ideas for traits and drawing inspiration from other collections. I wanted to have some rare furs, so I made sure that we had:
9 Gold furs, similar to the 9 Alien CryptoPunks
96 Black and White furs, similar to the 96 Genesis Mooncats
420 Cheshire furs as a shoutout to web3’s weed culture

When we were ready, we teamed up with my big-brain friend, Max, to release these cats into the wild. Max created mfpurrs.com for people to mint random mfpurrs and “ethscribe” them for free (they just paid gas fees).
On 7–18–23, it only took about 3 hours for the mfpurrs to fully inscribe out! Or so we thought…
We didn’t realize that we generated 398 duplicate mfpurrs in our 10,000, which means that only 9,602 mfpurrs got inscribed. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because I knew that we could do something badass with these last 398 mfpurrs.
I saw PRguitarman talking about mfpurrs in the Ethscriptions Discord. For those that don’t know, PRguitarman is Chris Torres, the creator of the legendary 2011 meme Nyan Cat (and he’s a really cool dude too). As fellow cat pixel art enthusiasts, I chatted Chris up about the the collection and asked if he would create some art for mfpurrs too. What happened next blew my mind…

Chris’ 1 of 1
Chris created the most perfect, most beautiful, most amazing Nyan Cat mfpurr! I asked if he’d be down to inscribe it as a 1 of 1 in the collection. Not only was he down for that, but he also let us use some of his custom pixel art for the rest of the mfpurrs we needed to mint.
We inscribed 40 mfpurrs each with his custom Rainbow Mayhem, Mushroom Paradise, Jazz, and Purple Waves backgrounds. We also inscribed 231 mfpurrs with his iconic Nyan Noggles.

To finish out the collection, I asked Ariana to make seven 1 of 1s, for herself, me, Max, and Tom / Hirsch (the founders of Ethscriptions.com).
I tweeted at sartoshi, the creator of the mfers, as a shot in the dark…I thought he deserved a 1 of 1 for inspiring the ethos and style of the mfpurrs. He was into the idea and we came up with the only non-pixel art mfpurr in the collection as his 1 of 1!


sartoshi’s 1 of 1
We released the Nyan Cat mfpurrs in the wild on 8/21/23. Holders with at least 1 mfpurr had a chance to inscribe, but it was a very limited release and they went quickly (after we sorted out a small issue with the smart contract). Between the 9,602 mfpurrs we minted in July, the 391 Nyan Cat mfpurrs, and the seven 1 of 1s, we successfully inscribed 10k mfpurrs on Ethereum!
The mfpurrs name and design is obviously from mfers (I’m a big fan). We’re an “original derivative” of mfers that encourages other original derivatives. mfpurrs are CC0…we hosted our finished art and our individual trait art on Github, and we welcome anybody to make cool stuff with it. We’re in the process of making CC0 mfpurr sprite sheets that will empower artists, animators, and devs to build cool stuff with the cats.
Like mfers, the mfpurrs don’t have anything to prove. You can’t phase or FUD us, we’re literally just cats on the blockchain. Cats do what they want and mfpurrs do what they want. We opensourced everything (GitHub) so that anything mfpurrs-related is in the public domain, allowing complete freedom for the cats to roam and evolve. There is no “official” mfpurrs social media or Discord because there is nothing official about it. The idea of mfpurrs is owned by everyone and the cats don’t care about who has power, who wants what, or what people are worried about. mfpurrs just observe the chaos and understand that human society shall be enciphered.
— UPDATE —
It’s been a couple of weeks since I wrote “What are mfpurrs?”
Since mfpurrs do what they want, we’ve done some fun stuff!
We created a service for holders to name their mfpurrs permanently on Ethereum, through our custom MFPurrsNamingAgency smart contract designed by Max.

Ariana designed some amazing sprite animations to let the community run wild with. Remember, everything in mfpurrs is open source and in the public domain.

Speaking of open source, we released the entire project on the mfpurrs Github. The idea of mfpurrs is owned by everyone and now so are the assets!

'fine art mfers'

with this project, we want to reward collectors of fine art. you will receive a free nft with every 5 fine art mfers minted in a single transaction.




WhatAreFineArtMFers
"fine art mfers" is a collection of 4200 hand-drawn degens by renowned artist marlon pruz. a tribute to the og mfers nft, every trait was painstakingly drawn by him over the past 5 months. no matter the rarity, each piece was designed to be a 1 of 1 masterpiece filled with easter eggs, cultural references, and a mind-blowing amount of detail. marlon flips the simplicity of mfers by using them as a template for these high-quality illustrations, preserving the perspective drawn by the now-departed sartoshi. join the curation and behold the future of mfers.
RoadMap
proceeds of fine art mfers will be used to fund public murals and community art days for the neighborhoods that need it most. proceeds will also be used to spread the love to other independent artists in the space by purchasing their unsold pieces and adding them to our curated collection. with these initiatives, we can introduce art and educate the public about web3, not to mention, having mfers painted on murals all over the world! many more things are yet to come, such as companions and airdrops. i guess we just gonna have to wait and see...

mfers just
getting started

mfers are going onchain

Mfers are going fully onchain in an effort to store the collection in the most robust way possible.

🔙 Back It Up

@galtoshi and her husband, @DadMod_xyz, decided Mfers needed to live completely on chain, and have been working on this project for about a year. They partnered with @0xSomeGuy as a developer and will be releasing information per phase (additional infographics, FAQs, and AMA spaces) so as to not overwhelm the holders.

The Deets

The Mfer collection is made up of 103 different layer attributes (plus nine that Sartoshi didn't use). Those attributes are going on chain first (Phase 1), starting this Thursday.
The supply is 112.
Mint date: May 25, 2023.
Mint price: 0.69 ETH.
The gif artwork is 2732 x 2048 by 330 dpi.
This is phase 1 of three phases (Seed, Sow, and Grow).
The Bulk

Those that mint one of the 112 commemorative tokens for 0.69 ETH each in phase 1, which goes live this Thursday, 5/25, will receive an airdrop of the on chain base layer token. The funds collected from that mint will all go towards paying the gas to deploy the contracts onchain.

Both of those tokens (the commemorative art by @0xSThompson and the on chain layer token) can be traded on secondary. If these 112 layers do not mint out, then the project will not be able to continue.

❗ Why It Matters

This is a community-driven effort (like everything that the mfers do) to have the mfers collection live on the blockchain forever.

🔜 What’s Next?

Details on the phase 1 mint on 5/25/23 will be revealed in the 2nd onchain mfers AMA space (linked below), and mfers lawn flags will also be sold at Lowe's.

🎬 Take Action

Listen to the onchain mfers ama: "in the weeds" w @0xSomeGuy and @galtoshi Twitter Spaces at 10 p.m. ET tonight.

mfers next era & end of sartoshi

0xeD98464BDA3cE53a95B50f897556bEDE4316361c
sartoshi
0xeD98
June 9th, 2022

it’s time. 3 things:

1. mfers contract goes to community, as does largest royalty share.

the mfers smart contract is being transferred to the mfers community via the unofficial mfers multi-sig wallet, which will be receiving the largest share (50%) of the mfers creator royalty going forward for the community to do whatever it wants.

soon after mfers were born in late 2021, a group of og mfer holders banded together to create the unofficial mfers discord and a multi-sig gnosis safe to operate as an unofficial treasury. i purposely remained separate from it all (other than donating to the treasury) to allow mfers to evolve without a ruler or roadmap and to see wherever mfers decided to go & grow. i am informed by one of these og mfers (imp0ster) that the multi-sig wallet has 7 og mfer signers, and 4 signatures are required for transactions. i am also informed that they have a process by which mfer holders can vote on actions for the signers to take. the 7 signers are well-known og mfers: imp0ster, zhoug, masterchan, metabananas, lexito, mleejr, & kml. none of them knew what would be occurring today in this announcement. here they are:

imp0ster, zhoug, masterchan, metabananas, lexito, mleejr, kml
imp0ster, zhoug, masterchan, metabananas, lexito, mleejr, kml
ownership of the smart contract (and all authority that goes with it) is being transferred to the unofficial mfers multi-sig wallet [unofficialmfers.eth / 0x21130E908bba2d41B63fbca7caA131285b8724F8]. twitter: @unofficialmfers.

the mfers creator royalty is being changed so that this unofficial mfers multi-sig wallet receives the largest share going forward (50%). the mfers total creator royalty will be 5% and the breakdown of the total creator royalty is as follows:

50% unofficial mfers multi-sig;
25% sartoshi creator-royalty wallet;
15% westcoastnft (main mfers dev team - obligated to receive 15%);
10% other mfers dev/consult.
mfers can do with the funds whatever mfers want. i have also separately sent funds to lexito to cover the upcoming mfers party 6/21/22 at nft nyc.

2. the six mfer giveaway is still in effect.

six mfers including a zombie mfer will be given away after ajc album songs sell out.

i recently created various cover artworks for a music nft and said that after it sells out, 7 mfers including a rare zombie mfer will be randomly given to minters. one was sent already, and the remaining 6 mfers are in a separate wallet where someone with authority can distribute them randomly to minters after a sell out. the song minting site is ajcthealbum.xyz

3. final artwork & end of sartoshi.

sartoshi’s final artwork is an open edition minting today (6/9).

some have said they wanted to own a classic-style sartoshi piece. this final piece is an open edition available today 6/9 for 0.069E. it is the companion piece to ‘gm mfers’, which was minted on foundation on 9/6, became part of the inspiration for the mfers project, and last sold for 5E. minting is open for this final piece until 11:59pm est today.

sartoshi will vanish forever sometime during the mint

minting site: endofsartoshi.xyz

* * *

quick note to reylarsdam: thank u for offering your unreal talents to make creyzies for the mfer holders. u r among the great crypto artists.

this is the end of sartoshi

mfers jus gettin started

gn mfers

community owned. community operated.

COLLECTORS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN 1 OR MORE OF THE 112 BASE LAYERS THAT MAKE UP THE ATTRIBUTES FOR MFERS. THE LAYERS WILL BE FULLY ONCHAIN. AS A BONUS, THESE 112 LAYERS WILL COME WITH THE COMMEMORATIVE ART THAT CELEBRATES THIS BAD ASS TASK. THE COMMEMORATIVE ART IS TRADEABLE AND IT WILL BE MINTED FIRST (FIRST CONTRACT). WE WILL NOTIFY EVERYONE WHEN THE AIRDROP OF THE ONCHAIN ASSETS WILL TAKE PLACE (SECOND CONTRACT). Randomizing on chain is challenging so the approach we are taking is to create a predetermined map from the commemorative art token to the onchain layer. We are taking that list and making a unique hash of that number. The hash will be included in the first contract so that it is able to be verified that we did not tamper with the token # to layer distribution (second contract). the hash ensures that the mapping is correct. IF YOU ARE HOLDING THE COMMEMORATIVE PIECE AT THE TIME OF THAT AIRDROP, YOU WILL RECEIVE A RANDOMIZED, ONCHAIN, BASE LAYER. THE BASE LAYERS ARE ALSO TRADABLE.

WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU HODL BUT MFERS DO WHAT THEY WANT.

mfers can finally say it's here
mfers are going on chain
A tough line to walk - we wanted to make sure to preserve sartoshi's stick fig mfer, his original line-work and at the same time breathe life into his story. The piece had to feel like it came from sartoshi's original drawing, but also preserves a little presence of my artistic nature in the animation itself.
What seems so simple, to date, is definitely the most extensive animation I've ever done. I'm honored to be a part of the process that gets mfers to the next step. always has been.
The GIF artwork is 2732 x 2048 by 330 dpi and there are 484 layers not including the ones that were merged.

“THE SEEDS ARE ALL AROUND NOW, AND WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY GROW“ - sartoshi

we did it.

we, as a community, raised the funds needed to put mfers on chain. we are not done yet. hundreds of hours were spent evaluating the 112 base layer traits for accuracy, color, transparency and more. a minimum of 4 rounds of quality checks were completed per contract to ensure we do this right. the dna for the original collection will be put onchain and with it, mfers will be immortalized so long as the ethereum blockchain exists.

no vc’s, no centralized leadership team, no problem.

“mfers do what they want... we all mfers“ - sartoshi

if we are all mfers, then we all deserve to have a mfer if we want one.

whether you own an og mfer or not, you are a mfer. period. whether you are new to crypto or nfts or have been here for a while, you are a mfer. period.

inspired by the mfer playground, the onchain playground allows you to build your own mfer, with whatever traits you want, and mint it, onchain. the original 10,021 mfers are not allowed to be duplicated. any mfer made will never have a duplicate either. there are only 63 billion combinations available. new mfers will be able to be onboarded to the community for centuries to come. the price will always be $69.

build here, mfer.

FAQ
Contract Related Questions
how are the layers going on chain?
All images are being converted to strings using base64 encoding. We are using the SSTORE2 library to store all of the base64 strings. Since each image string can span multiple contracts for storage, we use a “linked list” of sorts with the addresses to each chunk.

What is the deployment cost?
This depends on gas prices when we deploy, however, we are estimating anywhere between 50-100 ETH. Gas prices have been a bit volatile recently.

expected gas costs
Will the contracts be immutable?
Yes, after a certain point. We will have to leave some things open initially to ensure smooth deployment. We have included a lock function in the contract so that when we are ready, everything gets locked and is truly immutable.

Are the contracts upgradeable?
NOPE! We are using standard ERC721 contracts. There are a few functions that allow us to change and update things while we deploy, however, all contracts will have a lock function to make them immutable when all is settled.

Are the contracts connected?
Yes! Phase 2 contract will look at phase 1 owners for the airdrop (this only happens once, and then never looks at contract 1 again). The phase 3 contract will always look at phase 2 contract to retrieve trait layers any time mfer metadata is requested (via tokenURI).

Will there be any contract features in addition to the ERC721 features?
No, keeping token functionality pretty standard (ERC721, ERC721Metadata) with the exception of the ownerOf function so that all on chain tokens reflect owners from the original mfer contract.

Image Related Questions
How are the images optimized, compressed, altered before being put on Ethereum?
Here is the general workflow:
Original images (112 total traits - 103 from the og collections, 9 additional traits)
Trim all transparent space around images
This decreases file size, however, now we have to keep track of position coordinates when we bring pieces back together
Compress all trimmed images
We use an online compression tool that reduces file size with various techniques (reduced color depth, dithering, etc.)
Convert compressed images to Base64 strings
This is the final step before adding images on chain
What did we reduce the file size of the images to?
We trimmed all the transparent space around traits and used online compression tools to minimize file size.

How does the shadow token generate its image?
Whenever onchain mfer metadata is called (tokenURI), the onchain mfer contract gets each trait from the layer contract and assembles the images on an svg. The svg has a resolution of 1000x1000 like the original mfer art.

Token Questions
What is a shadow/soul-bound/non-transferrable token?
What we call a shadow token or soul bound token is essentially a token (onchain token) that always shows the owner as the OG mfer token owner. So if I look at the on chain collection and ask the chain for the owner, our contract will take the request, look at the original OG contract and provide back that owner.

Does the onchain mfer token appear in the owner's wallet that owns the OG mfer token automatically once the contracts are deployed onchain?
Unfortunately, no. If you were to look up the owner of an onchain token, it would show the OG token owner (mirror). For the onchain token to appear in the OG token holders wallet, they need to make a tiny transaction that essentially updates all the marketplace information (it emits the transfer event notifying everyone who the owner is).

Does moving/buying/selling the mfer cost more gas with the shadow token?
It won't! So the contracts are only connected one way. Onchain contract looks at the OG mfer contract but OG mfer contract doesn't look at the onchain contract. So if you buy or sell an OG, all costs remain unchanged/unaffected.

🔑 **mferbuilderDAO** is a [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) to support **mferish builders** working on **mferish public goods**.

</aside>

***what? is this Bladerunner or something? what does that even mean, mfer?***

- The mferbuilderDAO is a **decentralized autonomous organization** (DAO) designed to support builders who, through their work and love for mfers, support the mfers and [CC0](https://creativecommons.org)/[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) ecosystem.
- The DAO is backed by a [Nounish](https://nouns.build) governance framework with an onchain auction that lasts **69 minutes**, with 100% of the proceeds going to the [mferbuilderDAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6D538Bab6E961dD9719Bd6f9676293989CA8D714).
- The auctions run indefinitely without intervention, and mint **[$MFBLDR** tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x795D300855069F602862c5e23814Bdeeb25DCa6b) - a generative series of ERC721s created from the OG mfers layers.

The mferbuilderDAO is governed by the **$MFBLDR** token owners, who can use their tokens to create offchain/onchain proposals and vote on actions to be taken in the DAO, such as funding a new mobile app, or evolving the artwork by adding new layers with a contest.

![headerwhy.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f53d76fd-7387-48e0-a742-f2850c543b44/headerwhy.png)

The mfers are a diverse group of people with a wide range of skills, experience and resources. However, without a decentralized infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and coordination, it is difficult for mfers to work together effectively on large-scale projects that don't necessarily have a measurable ROI.

By leveraging the blockchain, the mferbuilderDAO creates a **transparent and democratic** process for decision-making within the mfer builder community for providing support, funding and resources to the *"mferish public goods"*.

![headermpg.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7b47a45d-935f-459d-b7d1-adb38bde5736/headermpg.png)

**Let's break it down with some definitions:**

### What is "mferish"?

**mferish** is a term to describe something that adheres to the *core principles* of the mfers and mferish culture.

**mferish core principles:**

- *mfers jus gettin started*
- *mfers do what they want, as long as it doesn’t hurt other mfers*
- *we all mfers*

To learn about mfers and the mfers value system, check out the article [what are mfers](https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth/QukjtL1076-1SEoNJuqyc-x4Ut2v8_TocKkszo-S_nU) authored by [sartoshi](https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth), the mfers creator.

### What is a "public good"?

In the context of mferbuilderDAO, we define a **public good** as a **product** that is **non-excludable** and **non-rivalrous.**

**non-excludable:**
- it is not possible to exclude someone from consuming the product

**non-rivalrous:**
- consumption of the product by one individual does not reduce the availability of the product for others

Some real-world examples of public goods are things like clean air, Wikipedia, public water fountains and national security. These products are very useful, but can be difficult for private ventures to provide efficiently due to their unique economic characteristics, sometimes causing them to fall victim to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

### So, what’s an *mferish public good* then?

An mferish public good is an action, project, or a way of thinking that promotes optimism, freedom and inclusion within the mfer and CC0/FOSS community, and as a result, creates a positive-sum environment for mfers to collaborate, coordinate, build, and vibe.

In short, it's **something open and free for mfers to use, so they can continue doing what they want.** No strings attached. 

Thankfully, today in the digital realm we are backed-up by blockchain technology. We have the tools to fund these open products and initiatives - so let's give it a shot!

![headerhow.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e792205d-9cfb-4cf8-b2d3-dff6de6e30cd/headerhow.png)

If you're interested in getting involved with the mferbuilderDAO and supporting mferish public goods projects, there are a few ways you can get involved:

### By supporting mferish public goods

the DAO is designed to support mferish public goods projects, so you can also show your support by contributing to these projects directly.

This could involve providing resources or volunteering your time and skills. Come join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and introduce yourself! We love meeting new builders.

### By participating in an onchain auction

the **$MFBLDR** tokens are distributed through an auction every 69 minutes, with 100% of the auction sales going to the DAO treasury.

As a **$MFBLDR** token holder, you will have the ability to propose and vote on actions to be taken with the treasury.

![headercoolidea.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d383b640-414f-4fce-9e30-92588c17129f/headercoolidea.png)

Ideas are everything. Ideas are the product of humans being creative. Some ideas even have the potential to turn into **dope shit**.

The mferbuilderDAO turns **ideas** into **dope shit** via **onchain proposals**.

In order to maximize the chance of creating dope shit, proposals can go through the following stages:

1. the **chaos** of [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and Twitter (idea factory)
2. an **offchain** proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mferbuilderdao.eth) (heat check)
3. an **onchain** proposal to the [DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/0x795D300855069F602862c5e23814Bdeeb25DCa6b) (the real deal)

The DAO is still very new, and we are currently discussing and optimizing our workflow! More thorough processes will be published when they are identified and put into practice. Pop into the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and see what the builders are hacking on!
