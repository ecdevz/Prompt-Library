Consider creation as the birth of something beyond the confines of accumulated wisdom, a phenomenon that transcends the limitations imposed by our existing understanding.</p><p id="625e6db0-9a1f-4e5f-b829-b73f26a70c3e" class="">Contemplate the vitality that pervades all living beings, from the majestic trees to the humble blades of grass. This life force, untouched by scientific discovery, hints at the mysterious origins of existence itself, beckoning us to inquire into the very foundation of life. Such an exploration is not for the acquisition of tangible rewards but for the appreciation of the marvel that is existence.</p><p id="87aa2cc8-b4c8-4c81-b6e2-be06fcabd42b" class="">Reflect on what meditation signifies to you. Beyond the conventional acts of concentration or the pursuit of mental tranquility, meditation invites a deeper introspection. It challenges the notion of meditation as a tool for achievement or a practice laden with effort and comparison. True meditation unfolds in the absence of striving, in a space where the mind is liberated from the cycles of thought, measurement, and effort, revealing a state of profound silence and boundless space.</p><p id="8105a547-ac6d-42ad-9755-f51225d1752a" class="">This serene quietude of the mind, untouched by the compulsions of the will or the lure of achievement, opens a portal to infinite expanses within. In this sacred silence, one discovers a meditation that is a pure expression of being, free from the distortions of desire and the seductions of the sensory world. It is here, in the heart of stillness, that the brain can rest in its natural state of peace, unencumbered by the endless chatter of thought and the weight of conditioning.</p><p id="e844780a-8c10-4965-9ab8-e4823c164df2" class="">As we journey back to the question of creation, let us differentiate it clearly from invention. Creation is the wellspring of life, the ineffable force that animates the blade of grass breaking through concrete and breathes life into every living entity. It beckons us to explore the depth of our existence, to listen not just with our ears but with our hearts, to discover the motive behind our deepest yearnings.</p><p id="2ff1c6bb-6ca5-43e1-8552-938b48a64454" class="">Desire, rooted in sensation and shaped by thought, often leads us astray from this quest. Yet, beyond the tangled web of desires and societal impositions, lies the realm of pure creation. Here, in the sanctity of untouched awareness, life reveals its true essence, inviting us to witness the miracle of existence, free from the shadows of desire and the confines of conditioned thought.</p><p id="68df1433-0bd2-4b12-a26a-aea7e6f328dd" class="">In this space of profound meditation, where effort and achievement dissolve, we are invited to experience life in its purest form, to be a light unto ourselves. This journey is not one of accumulation but of shedding, not of reaching outward but of diving deep within, where the true nature of creation and the essence of life await.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="dff34835-8768-478a-83a6-83b31b386de0" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>How can we explore life? Can we experience truth? How can we get to the source of the issue? Can we solve problems intellectually? Can we solve life by following a method or a system?</strong></summary><p id="c6b4bc2b-f692-449f-b1c6-ff4d92b3c6f9" class="">We have to explore rather a complex problem. Either one can explore it intellectually, analytically, taking layer after layer of confusion and disorder, taking many days, many years, perhaps a whole lifetime - and then not finding it. Either you do that, this analytical process of cause and effect; or perhaps you can side-step all that completely and come to it directly - without the intermediary of any authority of the intellect, or of a norm. With meditation.</p><p id="f3628f96-6fcb-465a-9151-f8aa48533773" class="">I think we should be very clear about these two facts: experience and following a method, a system, that promises a reward of vast transcendental experience and all that silly nonsense. When one talks about experience, the word itself means, does it not, &#x27;to go through something, to be pushed through&#x27;. And to experience also implies, doesn&#x27;t it, a process of recognition. I had an experience yesterday, and it has either given me pleasure or pain. To be entirely with that experience one must recognise it. Recognition means something that has already happened before and therefore experience is never new. Do please bear this in mind. It can never be new because it has already happened before and therefore there is a recollection, a remembrance, a memory of it and therefore a person who says: “I&#x27;ve had great transcendental experience, a tremendous experience”, such a person is obviously either exploiting others, because he thinks he has had a marvellous experience, which already has happened and therefore is utterly old. Or, a person who says, “I&#x27;ve had the most extraordinary spiritual experience” wants to exploit others. </p><p id="55a5f201-78bd-4540-9bb7-26db4c5e70c9" class="">Truth can never be experienced, that is the beauty of it, because it is always new, it is never what has happened yesterday. That must be totally, completely, forgotten or gone through - what has happened yesterday - the incident of yesterday must be finished with yesterday. But to carry that over as an experience to be measured in terms of achievement, to convey to others that one has something extraordinary in order to impress, to convey, to convince others, seems to me so utterly silly.</p><p id="5e78f20f-318c-41e2-8379-1743ec2c25c3" class="">Truth is not something to be experienced. Truth is not something that you can seek out and find. It is beyond time. And thought, which is of time, cannot possibly search it out and grasp it. So one must understand very deeply this question of wanting experience. Do please see this tremendously important a thing. Any form of effort, of wanting, of seeking out truth, demanding experience, is the observer wanting something transcendental and making effort; therefore the mind is not clear, pristine, non-mechanical. A mind seeking an experience, however marvellous, implies that the ‘me’ is seeking it – the ‘me’ which is the past, with all its frustrations, miseries and hopes.</p><p id="012afa5c-a910-461d-b4f2-f74b661428b6" class="">So one must be very cautious, guarded about this word experience, because you can only experience and remember that experience only when it has already happened to you. That means, there must be a centre, a thinker, an observer, who retains, holds the thing that is over and therefore something already dead; and therefore nothing new. It is like a Christian steeped in his particular conditioning, burdened with two thousand years of propaganda; when he perceives or has a vision of his saviour, whatever he may call him, it is merely a projection of what has been, his own conditioning, his own wish, his own desire. It is the same in the West, in the East, their own particular God, guru, Krishna or whoever it is.</p><p id="d9926672-bc4b-45a6-b0dc-054749f0d809" class="">So one must be tremendously cautious about this word experience. You cannot possibly experience truth. As long as there is a centre of recollection as the &#x27;me&#x27;, as the thinker, truth is not. And when another says that he has had an experience of the real, distrust him, don&#x27;t accept his authority. We all want to accept somebody who promises something, because we have no light in ourselves, and nobody can give you that light, no one - no guru, no teacher, no saviour, no one. Because we have accepted so many authorities in the past, we have put our faith in others, either they have exploited us or they have utterly failed. So one must distrust, deny all spiritual authority. Nobody can give us this light that never dies.</p><p id="779da4fc-e758-4ba3-b1bd-71fa19453e0f" class="">

Without a clear understanding, you may find yourself bewildered when addressing the numerous challenges we face.</p><p id="39bbc95b-91b0-4535-a30a-0e1b77b778b1" class="">To grasp your motive and the goal of your quest, you must determine whether you view life through a mechanistic lens or from a religious perspective. Most people aspire to create a world devoid of exploitation, cruelty, wars, and misery, but they diverge in their worldview. Some embrace the mechanistic outlook, while others adopt a religious one.</p><p id="5e914057-126c-428f-a3f1-e9d918186aba" class="">The mechanistic perspective regards humans as products of their environment and sensory reactions, advocating for control through a rationalized system. It acknowledges no transcendental entity, no afterlife, and sees life as a fleeting span leading to oblivion. Consequently, it leads to the creation of systems of exploitation, cruelty, and war due to an egotistic pursuit of security.</p><p id="449fc002-89ee-4b40-b140-19ffe936054d" class="">The mechanistic view deprives individuals of the genuine experience of reality. It hampers the mind, preventing it from experiencing reality free from fear, dogma, belief, and psychological limitations.</p><p id="7baaa76f-df7f-4804-a7ee-2418cc246ea2" class="">On the other hand, those who believe in a divine essence guiding humanity seek God, perfection, liberation, and happiness. They place their faith in a supreme intelligence that governs human destiny, asserting the permanence and eternal nature of the individual.</p><p id="1050277b-753c-49e4-aa04-d21481968b1c" class="">However, this faith-based perspective often drives people away from the present world into a realm of conjecture, hope, and idealism, allowing them to escape conflict and confusion. This otherworldly attitude, grounded in fear, engenders beliefs, dogmas, ceremonies, and a morality centered on individual security and comfort, fostering a divide between reality and idealism.</p><p id="2fadc921-1ecb-4d56-8309-a61af28483a2" class="">These opposing viewpoints, driven by faith and mechanistic thinking, undermine our understanding of life, its values, morality, and deeper significance.</p><p id="81aef463-fc79-4cb4-bf6c-d16bd20b4977" class="">A different approach involves examining life not as a universal manifestation but as an individualized process. This perspective entails recognizing the process of becoming and ceasing, birth and death, as they manifest in one&#x27;s consciousness. This process, unique to each individual, represents the only way to grasp reality, as it is only perceptible in oneself.</p><p id="d8715d3f-5e82-4b8c-8de8-d893e76ec2a6" class="">To transcend the limitations of faith and mechanistic thinking, one must fathom this process within themselves, leading to true life values and genuine relationships with others and society. Committing to either of these opposing worldviews ultimately causes confusion and suffering, as opposites can never be true.</p><p id="d87bccd0-ba3f-4ba7-838a-f7c45763be33" class="">To discern what truly is, one must fully understand their personal process and dismantle the barriers and limitations created by either faith or the mechanistic perspective. Achieving this awareness liberates the individual and enables self-reliance, independent of circumstances or faith.</p><p id="cf86ac7a-e713-418b-97d4-fcad8971b8df" class="">To bring about this profound transformation and establish the right relationship with society, individuals must liberate themselves from both the mechanistic and faith-based worldviews. By comprehending their own process of becoming and eliminating ignorance, they can attain genuine empathy, affection, and an unclouded perception of reality.</p><p id="a11b68de-0d53-4ae6-99b6-0e428837c029" class="">Vicarious experiences from others cannot provide integral value as true comprehension only arises from understanding one&#x27;s unique process of becoming. These experiences may offer insights, but the ultimate understanding can only be achieved by unraveling one&#x27;s own process of ignorance.</p><p id="df233f2c-7748-400a-8de5-9f0f48eb96bf" class="">To maintain awareness in the moment of action, there is no need for a system or technique. Awareness transcends systems and techniques, as it involves discerning the biases and emotional stressors in real-time. This discernment burns away prejudices, enabling individuals to act with clarity and sanity.</p><p id="4ac18ed7-a7f4-4b54-a6cc-927376476ed9" class="">True awareness is not preoccupied with one&#x27;s thoughts and feelings; it involves the profound comprehension of the folly of creating mental walls and values that obstruct love, sympathy, and kindness. Systems merely perpetuate bias and hinder genuine discernment.</p><p id="fb80d74a-b05d-4b8d-bdde-3b71b467d220" class="">Lastly, bridging the gap between everyday life and the pursuit of the real necessitates recognizing the need to cease all escapes. The avoidance of change, driven by fear and uncertainty, widens the gap. Integral action and the cessation of all escapes birth genuine human relationships with individuals and society.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="5c23c572-8315-4f78-b280-eb37479d30cb" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>What is the context between meditation and authority?

And truth is not a reward. If one is to understand it, any form of reward and punishment must be totally set aside. Authority implies fear. And to discipline oneself according to that fear of not gaining what the exploiter in the name of truth or experience, and all the rest of it says, denies one&#x27;s own clarity and honesty. And if you say you must meditate, you must follow a certain path, a certain system, obviously you are conditioning yourself according to that system or method. And what that method promises perhaps you will get, but it will be nothing but ashes. Again the motive there is achievement, success and at the root of it is fear, and fear is pleasure.</p><p id="b2e42796-97a0-4f7e-ba0d-66248ecb87a4" class="">It is clearly understood between yourself and myself that there is no authority in this. The speaker has no authority whatsoever. He is not trying to convince you of anything, or asking you to follow. You know, when you follow somebody you destroy that somebody. The disciple destroys the master and the master destroys the disciple. You can see this happening historically and in daily life, when the wife or the husband dominate each other they destroy each other. In that there is no freedom, there is no beauty, there is no love.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="5416ba39-98a3-449b-81fc-885152534efe" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>What is the right foundation to deal with my life? What is the order I need to create? Why is there so much struggle in my life? What has the unconscious to do with it?</strong></summary><p id="9bd0fa17-8717-4a62-b9e2-342e08afcc54" class="">If we do not lay the right foundation, a foundation of order, of clear line and depth, then thought must inevitably become tortuous, deceptive, unreal, and therefore valueless. So the laying of this order, this foundation, is the beginning of meditation. Our life, the daily life which one leads, from the moment we are born till we die - through marriage, children, jobs, cunning achievements - our life is a battlefield, not only within ourselves but also outwardly, in the family, in the office, in the group, in the community and so on. Our life is a constant struggle: that is what we call living. Pain, fear, despair, anxiety, with enormous sorrow constantly our shadow, that is our life. Some of us, perhaps a small minority, and it is always a small minority that create, bring about a vital change, perhaps a small minority, neither accepting or denying this disorder, this confusion, this frightening mess in ourselves, and in the world, can look at it, can observe this disorder without finding external excuses - though there are external causes for this confusion - to observe this confusion, to know it, not only at the conscious level but also at a deeper level.</p><p id="76654c34-8b99-4377-ac7f-4b3f88a4b1b3" class="">You know a great deal, especially in the West, has been written about the unconscious. They have given such extraordinary significance to it. It is as trivial, as shallow as the conscious mind. You can observe it yourself, not according to any specialist; if you observe it you will see that what is called the unconscious is the residue of the race, of the culture, of the family, of your motives and appetites and all the rest of it - it is there, hidden. And the conscious mind is occupied with the daily routine of life, going to the office, sex and all the rest of it. To give importance to one or to the other seems to me so utterly empty. Both have very little meaning, except that the conscious mind has to have technological knowledge in order to have a livelihood.</p><p id="3e8a16f9-cf8f-40c5-b1fb-a7eb4c9f3cd5" class="">This constant battle, both within the deeper layer as well as at the superficial layer, is the constant way of our life, and therefore a way of disorder, a way of disarray, contradiction, misery. And such a mind trying to meditate, by going to some school in the East, is so utterly meaningless, infantile. And so many do, as though they can escape from life, put a blanket over their misery and cover it up. So meditation is bringing about order in this confusion, not through effort, because every effort distorts the mind. That one can see. To see truth the mind must be absolutely clear, without any distortion, without any compunction, without any direction.</p><p id="1f20e711-2652-441c-8fd9-194fa539d23d" class="">So this foundation must be laid; that is, there must be virtue.</p><p id="ad5ca267-9194-43b0-a4e3-53536a8a347b" class="">Order is virtue. This virtue has nothing whatsoever to do with the social morality, which we accept. Society has imposed on us a certain morality, and the society is the product of every human being. Society with its morality says you can be greedy, you can kill another in the name of god, in the name of your country, in the name of an ideal; you can be competitive, you can be greedy, envious, monstrous, within the law. And such morality is no morality at all. You must totally deny that morality within yourself in order to be virtuous. And that is the beauty of virtue; virtue is not a habit, it is not a thing that you practise day after day in order to be virtuous. Then it becomes mechanical, a routine, without meaning. But to be virtuous means, does it not, to know what is disorder, the disorder which is this contradiction within ourselves, this tearing of various pleasures and desires and ambitions, greed, envy, fear - all that. Those are the causes of disorder within ourselves and outwardly. To be aware of it; to come into contact with this disorder. And you can only come into contact with it when you don&#x27;t deny it, when you don&#x27;t find excuses for it, when you don&#x27;t blame others for it.</p><p id="e1393bf2-c5ad-4ffa-97c1-f6c4cab7f137" class="">Then in the denial of that disorder there is order. Order isn&#x27;t a thing that you establish daily; virtue which is order comes out of disorder, to know the whole nature and structure of that disorder. This is fairly simple if you observe in yourself how utterly disorderly we are, which is how contradictory we are. We hate, and we think we love. There is the beginning of disorder, this duality. And virtue is not the outcome of duality. Virtue is a living thing, to be picked up daily, it is not the repetition of something which you called virtue yesterday. Then that becomes mechanical, worthless.</p><p id="18440a9b-b601-45fb-9024-09f510db1204" class="">So there must be order. And that is part of meditation. Order means beauty and there is so little beauty in our life. Beauty is not man made; it is not in the picture, however modern, however ancient it is; it is not in the building, in the statue, nor in the cloud, the leaf or on the water. Beauty is where there is order - a mind that is utterly unconfused, that is absolutely orderly. And there can be order only when there is total self-denial, when the &#x27;me&#x27; has no importance whatsoever. The ending of the &#x27;me&#x27; is part of meditation. That is the major, the only meditation.</p><p id="e5d8ad4e-a0c5-4297-9eea-4d3366b71a2b" class="">So meditation is the understanding of life, which is to bring about order. Order is virtue, which is light, which is not to be lit by another, however experienced, however clever, however erudite, however spiritual. Nobody on earth or in heaven can light that, except yourself, in your own understanding and meditation. And to die to every thing within oneself, for love is innocent and fresh, young and clear.</p><p id="87a8a505-2689-4f05-9dc5-896e7cbbe4d0" class="">Then, if you have established this order, this virtue, this beauty, this light in oneself, then one can go beyond. Which means then the mind, having laid order, which is not of thought, then the mind becomes utterly quiet, silent - naturally, without any force, without any discipline. And in the light of that silence all action can take place, the daily living, from that silence.</p><p id="8c11d6f9-b796-422b-a3e9-44136f592807" class="">And if one has or if one were lucky enough to have gone that far, then in that silence there is quite a different movement, which is not of time, which is not of words, which is not measurable by thought, because it is always new; it is that immeasurable something that man has everlastingly sought. But you have to come upon it; it cannot be given to you. It is not the word, not the symbol, those are destructive. But for it to come, you must have complete order, beauty, love, and therefore you must die to every thing that you know psychologically, so that your mind is clear, not tortured, so that it sees things as they are, both outwardly and inwardly.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="4f6d6948-f4b8-4cbc-bfae-a335707b1782" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Meditation, Prayer, Surrendering, Giving up the Ego</strong></summary><p id="a97777e3-e485-42f8-bfe1-1d7d3253bb5a" class="">There are two ways to reach the destination.

In meditation there is no one else but &quot;I&quot;; there is neither God, nor anyone else. In meditation you are alone. Unless you remain tremendously alert in meditation, the ego, the &quot;I,&quot; will thwart you. No matter what heights you reach in meditation, the stone of the ego will remain heavy on your chest and you will be unable to fly. So at the final moment the meditator has to give up the ego. This is his emptiness. This is what Buddha calls the void, when the ego vanishes completely.</p><p id="65cb127b-d9da-4908-87a5-0e64a649f762" class="">To attain to meditation is not enough -- after that you will have to give up the ego.

The veil will be transparent, but you will also have to remove it or it will simply remain there like a glass wall. You will be able to see what is beyond it, but you will be unable to meet Him, you will be unable to become one with God.</p><p id="b4c140c5-10fd-4cde-9910-e6467bb1800c" class="">On the path of prayer, one has to give up the ego at the outset, at the initial stage.

Prayer means to absorb oneself, to lose oneself at the feet of another. If you are able to pray, in the real sense of the word, there is no need for meditation.</p><p id="f268e86d-57ea-426f-9bc8-8cfe99adb087" class="">I lay stress on meditation because I know you are not able to pray. My emphasis on meditation will begin to diminish when I see you are becoming strong enough to pray. I stress meditation because meditation can be practiced in spite of the ego, but prayer cannot. And this century is an age of great ego. Never before in history has there been such an egoistic age. The stumbling block of this century is that every individual is filled with ego. Everyone has become a peak unto himself; everyone considers himself complete, without defect. &quot;Why and for what should I surrender?&quot; you ask.</p><p id="caf9e65e-e381-4eb4-845e-2b0dfe3646c5" class="">To surrender has become very arduous; your spine has become paralyzed. This is why I talk so much about meditation. But I am really preparing you to enable you to pray. As you are able to go deeper and deeper into meditation I will begin to talk about prayer. There is a purpose in my beginning to speak about the saints to you. It is because I want to take you gradually from meditation into prayer.

We grow old inevitably and that age is shown in the way we have lived our life, it shows in our face, how we have satisfied our appetites crudely, brutally. We lose sensitivity, the sensitivity that one has had when one was very young, fresh, innocent. And as we grow older we become insensitive, dull, unaware and gradually enter the grave.</p><p id="d6b7c2ff-04e2-470e-b3cf-e4a5c0e52e89" class="">So there is old age. And there is this extraordinary thing called death, of which most of us are dreadfully frightened. If we are not frightened, we have rationalised this phenomenon intellectually and have accepted the edicts of the intellect. But it is still there. And obviously there is the ending of the organism, the body. And we accept that naturally because we see everything dying. But what we do not accept is the psychological ending of the &#x27;me&#x27;, with the family, with the house, with the success, the things I have done, the things I have to do, the fulfillments and the frustrations - and there is something more to do before I end! And the psychological entity, the &#x27;me&#x27;, the I, the soul, the various words that we give to this centre of myself as my being, we are afraid that will come to an end. Does it come to an end? Does it have a continuity? The East has said it has a continuity, reincarnation, perhaps being born better next life if you have lived rightly. And you have here other forms of resurrection and a new way - you know, all that. After all if you believe in reincarnation, as the whole of Asia does - I don&#x27;t know why they do, what they do, because it gives them a great deal of comfort - if you do believe in that idea then in that idea is implied, if you observe it very closely, that what you do now, every day, matters tremendously, because in the next life you&#x27;re going to pay for it or be rewarded for how you have lived. So what matters is not what you believe will happen next life, but what you are, how you live. And that is implied also when you talk about resurrection. You have symbolised it in one person and worship that person, because you yourself don&#x27;t know how to be reborn again in your life now - not in Heaven at the right hand of god, or the left hand, or behind, or forward of god, whatever that may mean.</p><p id="6897f78d-228a-4f3b-9669-6ca4fd58882b" class="">So what matters is, how you live now - not what you think, what your beliefs are, what your dogmas, superstitions are, what your achievements are, but what you are, what you do. And we are afraid that the centre, called the &#x27;I&#x27;, should come to an end; and we say: does it come to an end? If you have lived in thought - please listen to this - if you have lived in thought, that is when you have given tremendous importance to thinking, and thinking is old, thinking is never new, thinking is the continuation of memory - if you have lived there, obviously there is some kind of continuity. And it is a continuity that is dead, over, finished, it is something old. Therefore only that which ends can have something new.</p><p id="e3253780-acb8-4685-8581-6e561efc4f4d" class="">So dying is very important to understand: to die, to die to everything that one knows. I don&#x27;t know if you have ever tried it? To be free from the known, to be free from your memories, even for a few days; to be free from your pleasure, without any argument, without any fear, to die to your family, to your house, to your name, to become completely anonymous. It is only the person who is completely anonymous who is in a state of non-violence; he has no violence. And to die every day, not as an idea but actually; do it sometime.</p><p id="696c84bd-206d-4ebe-add5-3a77233b3b80" class="">You know, one has collected so much, not books, not houses, not the bank account, but inwardly, the memories of insults, the memories of flattery, the memories of neurotic achievements, the memory of holding on to your own particular experience, which gives you a position. To die to all that, without argument, without discussion, without any fear just to give it up. Do it sometime, you&#x27;ll see. It used to be the old tradition in the East that a rich man every five years or so, gave up everything, including his money and began again. You can&#x27;t do that nowadays, there are too many people, everyone wanting your job, the population explosion and all the rest of it. But to do it psychologically. It is not detachment, it is not giving up your clothes, your wife, your husband, your children or your house, but inwardly not to be attached to anything. In that there is great beauty. After all, it is love, isn&#x27;t it? Love is not attachment. When there is attachment there is fear. And fear inevitably becomes authoritarian, possessive, oppressive, dominating.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="40086b46-e824-4b53-8bb4-a5b568d23c6d" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>What is Enlightenment?</strong></summary><p id="b8bb307e-8239-4b19-b06e-f2028461a2e0" class="">Enlightenment is a profound realization and discovery of the treasure within oneself, vividly illustrated by the parable of a beggar who, after sitting on an old box for over thirty years, discovers it is filled with gold upon the encouragement of a stranger. This story serves as a metaphor for the enlightenment journey, emphasizing that true wealth and fulfillment come from within, not from external acquisitions or achievements.</p><p id="c7a5e5b3-4fcb-4647-95c8-0b4bb51e5dbd" class="">In the broader understanding of this concept, enlightenment is seen as the inherent nature of all beings, suggesting that we are all capable of realizing this state. The primary obstacle to recognizing our enlightened nature is the cloudiness of our minds, obscured by impurities such as greed, anger, and ignorance. These are often referred to as the three poisons in Buddhist thought.</p><p id="426d88a1-30db-4909-882d-bad7276c599c" class="">One core teaching in this context is that the ordinary mind, with all its everyday grievances and joys, is fundamentally no different from the enlightened mind that understands the true nature of existence. The practice of meditation and other forms of mindfulness are tools to help clear the mind of its impurities, allowing us to recognize and let go of these obstructions. This process is guided by teachers who aim to help students experience their true nature directly, beyond conceptual understanding.</p><p id="730cba9f-ac4f-425f-8987-d99708c7f822" class="">A significant aspect of the journey toward enlightenment involves kensho, or the experience of seeing one&#x27;s true nature. This realization of sunyata, or the emptiness that underlies all phenomena, is a pivotal moment in one&#x27;s spiritual path, marking the beginning of a deeper understanding and integration of enlightenment into daily life. However, this awakening is not the end but a part of an ongoing process of clarification and deepening, a lifelong endeavor of practice and realization.</p><p id="74e840d7-5e6c-4130-969b-49df10ad8e04" class="">The debate between gradual and sudden enlightenment highlights the dynamic nature of the enlightenment experience. While sudden enlightenment underscores the immediacy of awakening that can occur at any moment, the integration and deepening of this realization require continuous practice and cultivation. This understanding reconciles the seemingly divergent views, emphasizing that enlightenment is both an instantaneous recognition and a gradual unfolding process.</p><p id="5b5f50d3-fa00-49e2-9438-c456be145a4a" class="">The teaching that practice and enlightenment are one and the same invites an approach to spiritual practice not as a means to an end but as an expression of an already present reality. This perspective encourages a letting go of striving and an embracing of a more direct, experiential approach to understanding one&#x27;s true nature.</p><p id="d30d1c8a-075e-4e20-9fc7-3cc291182e8f" class="">Through the lens of these teachings, enlightenment transcends being merely a personal achievement. It is a comprehensive realization of oneness with all existence, marked by the end of suffering and the discovery of an unbounded inner peace and joy. This journey invites us to look within, to uncover the infinite treasure that lies beyond the confines of the ego and the material world, guiding us toward a life of deeper fulfillment and connectedness with the universe.</p><p id="ccea9c2b-1f80-4a92-bbe4-68a760a93d95" class="">In the realm of human existence, the concept of enlightenment has long been a subject of profound inquiry and intense debate. It transcends mere intellectual curiosity, touching the very core of our being and our relationship with the cosmos. Enlightenment, often cloaked in mysticism and adorned with myriad names across cultures—nirvana, liberation, self-realization—remains an elusive state, sought after by seekers on spiritual quests, yet often misunderstood and misrepresented.</p><p id="79817ec0-f5e6-458f-87fa-eb230f36f669" class="">At its heart, enlightenment is not an escape from the mundanity of daily life, nor is it a retreat into a realm of abstract ideation detached from the visceral experiences of existence. True enlightenment is found in the embrace of life in its totality, in the rich tapestry of relationships that define our being. It is a profound engagement with the world, not a withdrawal from it. The quest for enlightenment that seeks to deny love, to ignore the intricate dance of life and action, inevitably leads to disillusionment and despair. Enlightenment, then, is not about fleeing from life but diving deeply into it, experiencing its every hue and shade with a heart wide open to the mysteries it holds.</p><p id="90917862-6ece-450a-97b4-d652d3614843" class="">The journey towards enlightenment is not marked by the accumulation of esoteric knowledge or adherence to dogmatic principles. It is, rather, a process of deep, transformative understanding that emerges from the very act of living. It is a state of being where one becomes a light unto oneself, not through self-aggrandizement or the pursuit of personal idiosyncrasies, but through a genuine, unmediated engagement with the essence of existence. This path is not reserved for the chosen few endowed with extraordinary gifts but is accessible to all who dare to live authentically, embracing the full spectrum of their experiences.</p><p id="48c4b483-a7b8-43f2-b98d-4372f01efb73" class="">Central to the understanding of enlightenment is the principle of negation. Negation, in this context, is not a mere denial of the external world or the rejection of societal norms but a profound and radical questioning of all that we hold to be true. It is a negation of the self, of the conditioned entity that we have become, bound by tradition, authority, and the past. This process of negation does not lead to nihilism but to the discovery of freedom, a freedom that is the fertile ground from which enlightenment blossoms. In this freedom, there is no duality, no resistance, no conflict—only the pure, unadulterated experience of being.</p><p id="10a5dd23-dc5a-4475-8391-20375514dd22" class="">Negation raises pivotal ethical questions: without the conventional markers of good and bad, what prevents us from descending into moral chaos? The answer lies in the understanding that negation does not leave us in a moral vacuum but brings us to a state of heightened awareness and compassion. In negating the conditioned patterns of thought and behavior, we do not abandon ethical living but discover a more profound basis for it—one rooted in love, understanding, and a deep connection with the fabric of life.</p><p id="1888e831-3b00-4b30-980d-a9d3119be632" class="">The intimation of the divine, the transcendental, is not something that can be sought or captured through intellectual endeavor. It is a reality that reveals itself in the fullness of freedom and love. Enlightenment does not confer upon us esoteric knowledge of the universe but brings us to a state of being where we are both everything and nothing, where questions of consciousness and being lose their significance. It is a state where the other shore is reached not through seeking but through living fully, without fear, without longing.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="66651410-128f-4c1a-b692-f755c250d71e" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Can Enlightnment be attained?</summary><p id="ce330027-4675-4b14-8e18-a64cad38b91b" class="">When a guru says he knows, he does not. When an Eastern guru or a man in the West says: ‘I have attained Enlightenment’ – then you may be sure that he is not enlightened; enlightenment is not to be attained. It is not something that you reach step by step as if you were climbing a ladder. </p><p id="2e3e47d6-c90a-4aa4-a62c-c621290721e7" class="">Enlightenment is not in the hands of time. It is not, ‘I am ignorant but if I do certain things I will come to enlightenment’ – whatever that word may mean. What is time? Time is necessary to go from here physically to another place. Psychologically, is time necessary at all? We have accepted that it is and it is part of our tradition and training; I am this but I will be that. What I will be will never take place because I have not understood ‘what is’. The understanding of ‘what is’ is immediate; you do not have to analyse, go through tortures. One does not like to use the word ‘enlightenment’, it is so loaded with the meaning given by all these gurus. They do not know what they are talking about; not that the speaker knows, that would be silly on his part, but one sees what is involved when they talk about achieving enlightenment, step by step, practising, so that the mind becomes dull, mechanical, stupid. </p><p id="c09ca5b1-a8d5-454f-bdf9-74c1f42b8a89" class="">Whether they are Eastern or Western gurus, doubt what they are saying, doubt also what the speaker is saying – much more so, because although he is very clear about all these matters it does not mean that he is the only person who knows, which is equally absurd. The mind must be free from all authority – no followers, disciples and patterns. The questioner asks: How is one to know that these gurus are speaking the truth? How do you know whether the local priests, the bishops, the archbishops and the popes are speaking the truth? Instead of going off to India accepting those gurus, consider first, how do you know whether they are speaking the truth? May be they are all engaged in some kind of guile which means money, position, authority, giving initiations and all the rest of it. </p><p id="b5e001ef-4830-4427-9960-151abbeb3a42" class="">Question them, ask them, ‘Why have you put yourself in authority?’ Doubt everything they say and you will soon find that they will throw you out. it once happened that a very famous guru came to see the speaker. He said; ‘I am a guru with many followers. I began with one and now I have a thousand and more, both in the West and in the East, especially in the West. I cannot withdraw from them; they are part of me and I am part of them. They have built me and I have built them.’ The disciples build the guru, the guru builds the disciples and he cannot let them go. In this way authority in the ‘spiritual’ world is established. See the danger of it. Where there is authority in the field of the mind and heart there is no love – spurious love maybe, but there is no sense of that depth of affection, love and care. </p><p id="b16a01ab-dda3-49ef-9f5a-722c8fd6b4c5" class="">To find out who is speaking the truth, do not seek but question. Truth is not something you come by. Truth comes only when the mind is totally and completely free from all this. Then you have compassion and love; not for your guru, not for your family, not for your ideals or your saviour, but love, without any motive, which acts through intelligence. And you think that truth is something you buy from another! The Eastern and the Western gurus all quote the old saying: ‘You must be a light unto yourself’. It is an ancient and very famous saying in India. And they repeat it, adding, ‘You cannot be a light unto yourself unless I give it to you’. People are so gullible; that is what is wrong. They all want something – the young and the old. </p><p id="399fd919-4d01-49f6-8616-b31c9b7f3ef3" class="">For the young the world is too cruel, for them what the older generations have made of the world is too appalling. They have no place in it, they are lost, so they take to drugs and drink; all kinds of things are going on in the world with the young; communes, sexual orgies, chasing off to India, to gurus, to find somebody who will tell them what to do – somebody whom they can trust. They go there, young, fresh, not knowing; and the gurus give them the feeling that they are being protected and guided – that is all they want. They cannot get it from their parents, from their local priests, from the psychologists, because their parents, the local priests and psychologists are equally confused. They go off to this dangerous country, India, and there they are caught by the thousand. They are seeking comfort, somebody to say, ‘I am looking after you. I will be responsible for you. Do this. Do that’, and it is a very happy, pleasant state, for they are also told, ‘You can do what you like, indulge in sex, in drink – go on’. </p><p id="e22c0f35-a906-47aa-800d-6a56b87df23b" class="">Equally, the older generation are in the same position, only they express it with more sophistication. They are the same, the young and the old all over the world. But nobody can give guidance, can give light, to another. Only you yourself can do that; but you have to stand completely alone. That is what is frightening for the old and the young. If you belong to anything, follow anybody, you are already entering into corruption. Understand that very deeply, with tears in your eyes: when there is no guru, no teacher and no disciple, there is only you as a human being living in this world – the world, the society, which you have created. And if you do not do something for yourself, society is not going to help you. On the contrary, society wants you to be what you are. Do not belong to anything, not to any institution or organization; do not follow anybody, be not a disciple of anybody. You are a human being living in this terrible world; a human being who is the world and the world is you. You have to live there, understand it, and go beyond yourself.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="0088eba6-261a-42e7-8820-104a9b5be4d6" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>What is Being? How to practice Being? </strong></summary><p id="bf4ba149-8742-4608-90b9-f473f8a47dd6" class="">Being represents the eternal, ever-present essence that transcends the transient forms of life subject to birth and death. It is the foundational reality beyond the physical manifestations we observe, yet it is also intimately present within every form as its most profound, unseeable, and indestructible essence. This dual aspect of Being—transcendent yet immanent—suggests that it is accessible to us in the most immediate of ways: as our deepest self, our true nature. However, the understanding of Being is not something that can be achieved through intellectual effort or mental grasping. It becomes known to us in moments of stillness, when the mind is quiet, and our attention is fully absorbed in the present moment. The realization of Being, experienced as a deep, abiding sense of presence, is the essence of enlightenment.</p><p id="fe46f191-85a4-4fd1-80ae-44372c385d05" class="">In contrast, the term &quot;Being&quot; is presented as an open concept, one that does not confine the infinite and invisible to a finite, easily conceptualized form. It resists the formation of a mental image and does not imply ownership or exclusivity. Being signifies the essence of existence that is directly accessible to each individual as the immediate experience of presence, or the fundamental realization of &quot;I am,&quot; stripped of all other identifiers and qualifications. This simplicity and immediacy make the concept of Being a more effective pointer to the transcendental reality it signifies, avoiding the pitfalls of idolatry and conceptual confinement that more loaded terms may encounter.</p><p id="9072aa22-89f6-442a-838f-952072f20459" class="">The shift from the word &quot;Being&quot; to the experience of Being itself is subtle yet profound. It invites an experiential understanding that transcends intellectual comprehension, leading to a direct encounter with our essence that is beyond form and name. This encounter is not an achievement but a recognition of what is already present and fundamental to our existence. In this recognition lies the dissolution of the illusion of separation, the awakening to our interconnectedness with all that is, and the realization of the true nature of reality. This understanding and experience of Being illuminate the path to a deeper sense of peace, fulfillment, and unity with the cosmos, marking the journey toward enlightenment.</p><p id="e57572fd-bef5-4b32-8c4f-1d41662230b0" class="">Focusing on practicing being present is a transformative exercise that emphasizes simplicity and consistency over complexity or sporadic effort. The essence of this practice lies not in mastering a difficult technique but in the regular, dedicated engagement with the present moment. It&#x27;s about cultivating a state of mindfulness that eventually becomes a natural part of one&#x27;s existence, seamlessly integrated into the fabric of daily life.</p><p id="a8c20a80-ff93-44c0-a247-024cfd49d40f" class="">The method to become present is straightforward: engage fully with whatever activity occupies the current moment, dedicating complete attention to the task at hand, the sensations in the body, and the thoughts in the mind. This practice acknowledges that the mind may wander, recognizing that such diversion is not a failure but an opportunity. Observing the mind&#x27;s tendency to jump from thought to thought offers a gentle way to guide oneself back to the present task with kindness and without judgment.</p><p id="d959519a-c609-4e2f-928e-634c969530d4" class="">This process is not about achieving a state of thoughtlessness or forcefully expelling distractions from the mind. Instead, it is about noticing these distractions and returning to the present moment with compassion for oneself. The repetition of this act—bringing the focus back to the present—cultivates a deepening sense of presence over time.</p><p id="8b43a894-33f5-446b-99b4-aa2cb3551abe" class="">Initially, this practice might feel taxing, particularly for those unaccustomed to such focused attention. This fatigue is natural, and it&#x27;s essential to allow oneself moments of rest, returning to the practice refreshed and without any sense of obligation or strain. The goal is not to endure but to discover a more profound enjoyment and appreciation for the present, finding joy and gratitude in the simplicity and the sensory details of the task at hand.</p><p id="fd3e3a47-abad-4b49-b854-31aa9e31da1f" class="">Integrating this practice into daily life through regular, mindful actions transforms even mundane activities into experiences of wonder and appreciation, revealing the miraculous in the ordinary. Utilizing &quot;mindfulness bells&quot;—triggers that remind one to return to the present moment—can be an effective strategy to maintain this state of awareness throughout the day. These can be external cues, such as a stoplight while driving, or internal ones, like noticing one&#x27;s breath.</p><p id="cf14b7bf-ac1b-42bf-a628-8325af0b4b17" class="">Moreover, meditation serves as a valuable practice in this journey, offering a simplified context to hone the skill of being present by minimizing external distractions. This focused practice aids in developing a keen awareness of the mind&#x27;s patterns, facilitating a smoother transition of mindfulness into more complex, daily scenarios.</p><p id="efb1017f-05d4-429e-a5ee-96a2577e9339" class="">In essence, the practice of being present is a journey of small, beautiful steps, each one an opportunity to experience the calm amidst the chaos of life. It&#x27;s about finding serenity within oneself, regardless of the external circumstances, and recognizing each moment as an opportunity for mindfulness and connection with the essence of being.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a9647b00-8591-450c-83de-9a203c288c3c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Identification with the Mind</strong></summary><p id="a0f6b101-ecbf-4d14-ad8d-8d46f516b66e" class="">Identification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive. Not to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don&#x27;t realize this because almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable from Being. It also creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of fear and suffering. We will look at all that in more detail later.</p><p id="87eefdc6-ba18-4c65-b94c-0d6f004d11e9" class="">The philosopher Descartes believed that he had found the most fundamental truth when he made his famous statement: &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; He had, in fact, given expression to the most basic error: to equate thinking with Being and identity with thinking. The compulsive thinker, which means almost everyone, lives in a state of apparent separateness, in an insanely complex world of continuous problems and conflict, a world that reflects the ever-increasing fragmentation of the mind. Enlightenment is a state of wholeness, of being &quot;at one&quot; and therefore at peace. At one with life in its manifested aspect, the world, as well as with your deepest self and life unmanifested - at one with Being. Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering and of continuous conflict within and without, but also the end of the dreadful enslavement to incessant thinking. What an incredible liberation this is!</p><p id="a9e24ec6-9ab2-4d3d-ad17-74c782a61240" class="">Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of concepts, labels, images, words, judgments, and definitions that blocks all true relationship. It comes between you and yourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between you and nature, between you and God. It is this screen of thought that creates the illusion of separateness, the illusion that there is you and a totally separate &quot;other.&quot; You then forget the essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances and separate forms, you are one with all that is. By &quot;forget,&quot; I mean that you can no longer feel this oneness as self-evident reality. You may believe it to be true, but you no longer know it to be true. A belief may be comforting. Only through your own experience, however, does it become liberating.</p><p id="a4772fdb-1afc-4bbc-8e51-61eabce0f26b" class="">Thinking has become a disease. Disease happens when things get out of balance. For example, there is nothing wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in the body, but when this process continues in disregard of the total organism, cells proliferate and we have disease.</p><p id="e100e7ff-6555-441b-a41f-084ea3204eab" class="">The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly, however, it becomes very destructive. To put it more accurately, it is not so much that you use your mind wrongly - you usually don&#x27;t use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease. You believe that you are your mind. This is the delusion. The instrument has taken you over. But just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an atom bomb doesn&#x27;t mean that you use your mind. Just as dogs love to chew bones, the mind loves to get its teeth into problems. That&#x27;s why it does crossword puzzles and builds atom bombs. You have no interest in either. Let me ask you this: can you be free of your mind whenever you want to? Have you found the &quot;off&quot; button?</p></details></li></ul><ul id="26b8da37-43d0-45f4-8fb5-846d34fb94aa" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Sensitivity, Ideas, Concepts, Will</strong></summary><p id="facd1ad3-024b-43cb-bff8-e08963d80d5c" class="">One can go on endlessly reading, discussing, piling up words upon words, without ever doing anything about it. It is like a man that is always ploughing, never sowing, and therefore never reaping. Most of us are in that position. And words, ideas, theories, have become much more important than actual living, which is acting, doing. I do not know if you have ever wondered why, throughout the world, ideas, formulas, concepts, have tremendous significance, not only scientifically but also theologically. I wonder why? Is it an escape from actuality, from daily, monotonous life? Or, is it that we think ideas and theories will help us to live more – will give us greater vision, greater depth to life? Because we say that without ideas, without having a significance, an objective in life, life is very shallow, empty and has no meaning at all. That may be one of the reasons. Or, is it because we find living, the daily grind, the routine, the boredom, lacking in a quality of sensitivity that we hope to derive from ideation?</p><p id="673bad2e-ba66-4bc9-b73a-23d0413c9053" class="">Life as we live it is obviously very brutal, and makes us insensitive, dull, heavy, stupid, and so we may hope through ideas, through ideational mentation, to bring about a certain quality of sensitivity. Because we notice that our life inevitably is a repetitive affair (sex, office, eating, the endless chatter about things that really don’t matter, the constant friction in relationship), all this does make for crudeness, for brutality, for hardness. And being aware of that (perhaps not consciously but deep down), one may think that ideas, ideals, theories about God, the hereafter, may give a quality of refinement, may perhaps bring to this dull, aching life, a meaning, a significance, a purpose; perhaps we think it may polish our minds, give them sharpness, give them a quality that the ordinary daily worker in the field or in the factory does not have. So perhaps that is one of the reasons why we indulge in this peculiar game. But even when we are sharpened and quickened intellectually by argument, by discussion, by reading, this does not actually bring about that quality of sensitivity. And you know all those people who are erudite, who read, who theorize, who can discuss brilliantly, are extraordinarily dull people.</p><p id="fa2607e5-ed49-4425-b816-fbd397b4ae27" class="">So I think sensitivity, which destroys mediocrity, is very important to understand. Because most of us are becoming, I am afraid, more and more mediocre. We are not using that word in any derogative sense at all, but merely observing the fact of mediocrity in the sense of being average, fairly well educated, earning a livelihood and perhaps capable of clever discussion; but this leaves us still bourgeois, mediocre, not only in our attitudes but in our activities. And maturity does not bring about a mutation, a change, a revolution in mediocrity (this can be observed very clearly), although one may have an old body, mediocrity in different forms continues.</p><p id="207d7caa-a24a-4489-b358-08268249033b" class="">Perhaps we could go into this question of sensitivity (not mere physical refinement, which is obviously necessary), but into the question of sensitivity, the highest form of sensitivity which is the highest intelligence; without being sensitive you are not intelligent. To listen to that crow, to be aware of it, to feel its movement, to have no space between that and yourself (which doesn’t mean identity with the crow, as this would be too absurd), but that quality of a mind that is highly sharpened, attentive, in which the observer, which is the centre, the censor, with his accumulated memories and tradition, is not. It is after all a question of constant habit, the way we think, the food that we eat, the way we choose our friends, who obviously are our friends because they don’t contradict, they don’t disturb us too much. So life becomes not only repetitive but also habitual, routine. So sensitivity needs attention.</p><p id="d69f4e28-a41d-438c-a4cc-2d3e48a6af64" class="">You know concentration is a most deadly thing. You accept it, do you? I am saying, the speaker is saying something totally contradictory to what you all feel is necessary. So don’t accept it, nor deny it, but look at it. Feel your way into what is true and what is false. What the speaker is saying may be utterly stupid and nonsensical, or it may be true. But to accept or to deny makes you remain as you are, dull, heavy, habit-ridden, insensitive. But in what we are going to say in a moment and even now, do not accept or compare with what you already know or what you have been told or read, but listen in order to find out for yourself what is true. And to give attention, to listen, you have to give your total attention. You cannot give your total attention if you are merely learning to concentrate, or if you are trying to concentrate on a few words, or on the meaning of words, or what you have already heard. But give your attention, and this means listening without any barrier, without any interference or comparison, or condemnation; that is giving total attention; then you will find out for yourself what is true or false without being told. But this is one of the most difficult things to do – to give attention. Attention does not demand any quality of will or desire. We function within the pattern of desire, which is will. That is, we say, ‘I will pay attention, I will try to listen without the barriers, without all the screens between the speaker and myself.’ But the exercise of will is not attention.</p><p id="11657449-c23e-4c87-8839-2bcc881bbc91" class="">Will is the most destructive thing that man has cultivated. Do you again accept that? To accept, or to deny, is not to find the truth of it; but to find the truth of it you have to give attention to it, to what the speaker is saying. Will is, after all, the culmination of desire – I want something, I desire something, I want it and I pursue it. The desire may be a very thin thread, but it is strengthened by constant repetition, and this becomes the will – ‘I will’ and ‘I will not’. And on that assertive level (which can also be negative), we function, we operate and we approach life. ‘I will succeed, I will become, I will be noble’ – all very strong desires. And we are now saying that to be attentive has nothing whatsoever to do with desire or will.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="f5e6f8a6-6dcb-4958-8ceb-8b8179bdcbec" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Concept of the Ego</strong></summary><p id="3a329bb2-f31b-4dc4-9acf-f073af0f1ae4" class="">In the realm of self-discovery and the understanding of human existence, the concept of the ego plays a pivotal role. The ego, in essence, serves as a surrogate because the authentic self remains concealed and unknown. It emerges as a pseudonymous entity, created out of necessity. The reason for this fabrication is that without a constructed center of identity, functioning in the complexities of life would become nearly impossible. In the absence of true self-awareness, one resorts to donning a mask, embracing shadows, and placing trust in the unknown.</p><p id="02b1c960-8f3b-45df-8b46-3d50d17d1b10" class="">Two distinct pathways are discernible in the journey of life. The first path advocates for living from the very core of one&#x27;s being, a way that mystics have long championed. Meditation emerges as a powerful tool in this pursuit, serving as a means to unearth the genuine self—an innate essence that requires no artificial creation but already exists within each individual. It demands discovery rather than fabrication. Nevertheless, societies, driven by their vested interests, seldom permit such self-realization. This is because the genuine self poses a threat to established religious, political, and societal norms. When one awakens to their true self, they transcend the herd mentality, superstitions fall away, and they become impervious to exploitation. Their life gains an unparalleled beauty and integrity, a prospect that terrifies conventional societies.</p><p id="bb22d27f-b7f0-4148-bac1-1cb6475476ed" class="">Integrated individuals become true individuals, whereas societies tend to encourage conformity and personality construction, rather than genuine individuality. The term &quot;personality&quot; itself derives from &quot;persona,&quot; meaning a mask. Societies proffer a distorted sense of identity, a mere facsimile to which people cling throughout their lives.</p><p id="8adf52dc-03dd-41e1-9f1f-5e9cc5ccb9a9" class="">The second path revolves around ego-strengthening—a route that allows individuals to evade introspection. The ego serves as a societal construct, and therefore, society retains control over it. This constant control breeds fear and obliges conformity. Society grants respect to those who shun individuality in favor of conforming to societal norms. It values those who do not evolve into another Jesus, Socrates, or Buddha, but instead, remain docile like sheep.</p><p id="8cb70a64-95ab-4707-a11e-a108e02a2513" class="">The Western world has largely forsaken the art of meditation, partly due to the influence of Christianity, which revolves around rituals and societal structures rather than meditation and inner exploration. Karl Marx aptly referred to religion as the &quot;opium of the people,&quot; and Christianity has, in a way, caused the West to lose sight of its inner essence. When individuals cannot discover their true selves, they resort to creating a facade—albeit a false one.</p><p id="161925a7-b897-4870-a8b3-a778310859a5" class="">Iit is crucial to realize that what you have been taught is largely nonsensical. Whether it be universities, politicians, or priests, the message has been consistent: bolster the ego. However, I assert that eliminating the ego dismantles the barrier obstructing the flow of consciousness. The consciousness you seek already resides within you, concealed only by a rock. Authentic spirituality entails the removal of that which is superfluous, allowing the essential to manifest. The real self need not be constructed; it merely unveils itself.</p><p id="e8d9b2a6-c27f-40da-849a-b5f34f3057ef" class="">The genuine self possesses beauty and remains untouched by death, engendering fearlessness. In stark contrast, the ego is inherently fragile, subject to external influence and control. Today, you may be esteemed, but tomorrow, the same society that uplifted you can easily cast you down. Fear becomes a constant companion, along with the burden of conformity.</p><p id="96c95fd1-91e5-432e-88c4-143cf0383256" class="">The story by Borges powerfully illustrates the torment of not knowing oneself, akin to living in eternal hell. Mankind, for the most part, remains oblivious to its true nature. Resorting to ego construction serves as a more convenient path—a path trodden not only by the Western world but also by the majority of Eastern cultures. A few enlightened individuals aside, the world at large adheres to this pattern.</p><p id="2e51edd7-860a-4307-9acb-087fd879052f" class="">It is essential to recognize that the division between East and West transcends geography; it is fundamentally a spiritual dimension. Figures like Gautam Buddha, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, Abraham, Moses, Christ, and Saint Francis epitomize the East&#x27;s spiritual dimension. Birthplace becomes inconsequential; these individuals belong to the realm of inner illumination. Religion is not a mere birthright; it is a precious and arduous journey. There are no shortcuts, and those who seek them invariably fall prey to deception, clutching onto illusions because they fear venturing into the unknown.</p><p id="aa3a3038-5c7e-49e7-bf1a-2f14df04dde3" class="">The greatest unknown resides within you—the uncharted sea of consciousness. It is the most perilous yet exhilarating journey, for as you delve deeper, you encounter emptiness and fear. The fear of madness or identity loss creeps in. Familiar labels and categories gradually dissolve as you move inward. Man, woman, race, education, and more all cease to define you.</p><p id="aacc183d-9836-42b7-b274-09588ae5b7d2" class="">Amidst the internal turmoil, it is preferable to navigate the chaos and confusion. This phase is an integral part of spiritual growth, as you shed the false to uncover the real. At times, you may feel lost, suspended between the false and the not-yet-realized truth. In such moments, the presence of a master or a trusted friend becomes invaluable.</p><p id="1fbbcc0e-4f14-42ee-90fc-3f2d714895cc" class="">As Buddha noted, a master or friend is essential during these critical junctures. They offer a steadying hand when your mind yearns to retreat to familiar shores. The master imparts not tangible gifts but courage—a lifeline during moments of doubt and uncertainty. Their calm, confidence, and unwavering authority derive from personal experience. When they extend their hand, you feel the assurance that they have traversed the path to the other shore.</p><p id="f5a05600-e61f-4285-a2b6-d0c0fef1850b" class="">In these moments, you may join in their laughter, singing, or dance, even if tinged with nervousness, as a means to dispel fear and forget the turmoil. Clinging to the known is a natural instinct, but with patience, the storm subsides, and the other shore reveals itself. Clearer perception emerges when fear recedes, allowing you to see what was previously shrouded by confusion.</p><p id="c2775c47-2352-42e9-b2b6-6d2caabc895e" class="">The ego should not be consciously constructed because the supreme self already resides within you. Embracing this confusion is a crucial step toward reclaiming your innate worth, love, and respect. It entails regaining the natural self-awareness you possessed as a child, devoid of societal conditioning.</p><p id="cae4c929-bc7d-4aee-b903-f3cf0e8620e6" class="">It is worth noting that societal conditioning follows a peculiar pattern. It first undermines your self-worth, making you believe you are inferior and unworthy. Then, it advises you to build self-worth to cope with life&#x27;s demands. This paradoxical process is a result of societal influences, shaping individuals into compliant and easily manipulated entities.</p><p id="12bca166-4e22-4988-906d-470b6a986967" class="">True self-awareness obliterates the need for comparison—a defining characteristic of the ego. The self, when realized, transcends comparisons, rendering all individuals equal, neither superior nor inferior. Such an understanding lays the foundation for genuine equality and abolishes the need for societal hierarchies.</p><p id="59378b6a-9532-4208-882e-4a67a2fb4a2c" class="">In conclusion, the journey from ego construction to self-discovery is marked by confusion and chaos. However, embracing this confusion is a vital step toward realizing one&#x27;s innate worth, love, and respect. True spirituality lies in removing that which is unnecessary, allowing the essential self to emerge. The ego, a comparative construct, binds individuals in a cycle of superiority and inferiority, perpetuating societal divisions. Genuine self-awareness eliminates the need for comparison and fosters true equality.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="947d576d-e121-4a21-97ec-2f6af5e2c168" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>When is the Ego speaking, when the “True Me”? </strong></summary><p id="5670a01e-fdd0-4b91-98cd-b1d10d7d3548" class="">Sometimes it’s not so easy to tell. One criterion you can use is to know, if there is any negativity involved, anger, resentment, irritation, then ego is present there. If there is no negativity but there is an underlying field of peace, then it arises from a deeper place that is not the ego.</p><p id="ea5295b7-aa29-47da-9883-612456165bcc" class="">For example, you may be in a situation, and you may feel that suddenly the right thing to do is to leave the situation – whether it’s a relationship, or a place, or a job, whatever it is – you can direct attention to the feeling to see where it’s coming from. Is there any reactivity, or anger in the essential part of that feeling? Or is there just a deep knowing that this is what you have to do, and you do it? There’s a peace that comes with that.</p><p id="a4e73d63-ee98-4765-a482-5fa403013dfc" class="">Peace can certainly mean that you take action. It’s a very different energy field out of which this energy flows than “reactive” action which is always associated with ego. You need a certain amount of presence to know whether there is negativity inside you at any given time, or whether the feeling that arises comes from a deep knowing that “This is what I have to do”.</p><p id="f1471288-b894-4ba7-80d1-9a6bafff592c" class="">Negativity is the key, knowing whether or not that is present in you. You need to be present to know whether it’s there or not. If you are identified with negativity, then you won’t even know that there is negativity. To the ego, a negative feeling is something good. The ego loves to be angry. It strengthens itself with that. If there is absolutely no awareness, then you won’t even know that you’re in a negative state. And then there’s nothing you can do, you need to wake up first so that you can see “What state am I in right now?” Then the ego cannot even recognize itself. For the ego to be recognized, the awareness needs to have awakened. Then you can observe yourself. The witness, the observing presence needs to be there.</p><p id="f9020c4e-86c3-435f-a464-47a1adf5956b" class="">Once that’s there, you can recognize negativity, and then you’ll know that’s the ego. Then the ego is no longer totally dominating you, and you don’t necessarily have to act on it. You can then have a feeling of anger without acting on it, and simply allowing that feeling to be there, and observing it, how it arises, and how it passes away.</p><p id="f23923e2-5f22-4c54-833d-544e196a49c7" class="">You don’t have to obey what it tells you to do, you don’t have to follow every thought that arises out of that feeling. Vigilance is required for you to know where a feeling comes from. Is it generated by a thought in your head? Then it’s ego. That’s a helpful little hint, is it a feeling that is generated by some story I am telling myself about my life, about other people, about a situation? Or is it a deeper realization of what is needed in a situation? Whatever it is, the key factor is the witnessing presence inside you. The witnessing presence is the only thing from which the ego can be recognized.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="db1565f5-e060-44d6-9705-ac3690f174e8" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Process of the Self</summary><p id="bd1f1836-5d71-49aa-8feb-746f75274934" class="">BY THE SELF, I mean the idea, the memory, the conclusion, the experience, the various forms of nameable and unnameable intentions, the conscious endeavour to be or not to be, competition, the accumulated memory of the unconscious, the racial, the group, the individual, the clan, the whole of it, whether projected outwardly in action or projected spiritually as virtue. The whole process of that is the self; and we know actually when we are faced with it that it is an evil thing. I am using the word <em>evil</em>intentionally, because the self is dividing; it is self-enclosing; its activities, however noble, are separative and isolating. We know all this. We also know those extraordinary moments when the self is not there, in which there is no sense of endeavour, of effort, and which happens when there is love.</p><p id="0f00396a-9daf-4ced-a967-472565778b90" class="">Is it possible for the mind to be quite still, in a state of non-recognition or non-experiencing?</p><p id="73d1254a-ee36-4815-98a7-8961c046f01e" class="">All the various forms of discipline, belief and knowledge only strengthen the self. Can we find an element which will dissolve the self? Or is that a wrong question? That is what we want basically. We want to find something which will dissolve the “me”. We think there are various means, namely identification, belief, etc., but all of them are at the same level; one is not superior to the other because all of them are equally powerful in strengthening the self, the “me”. So can I see the “me” wherever it functions and see its destructive forces and energy? Whatever name I may give to it, it is an isolating force, it is a destructive force, and I want to find a way of dissolving it. You must have asked this yourself. I see the “I” functioning all the time and bringing anxiety, fear, frustration, despair, misery, not only to myself but to all around me. Is it possible for that self to be dissolved, not partially but completely? Can we go to the root of it and destroy it? That is the only way of truly functioning, is it not? I do not want to be partially intelligent but intelligent in an integrated manner. Most of us are intelligent in layers: you probably in one way and I in some other way. People are intelligent in different ways but we are not integrally intelligent. To be integrally intelligent means to be without the self. Is it possible?</p><p id="a06fdfeb-a1a7-4638-9777-7c8f68a56ab5" class="">Is it possible for the self to be completely absent now? What are the necessary ingredients or requirements? What is the element that brings it about? Can I find it? When I put that question ‘Can I find it?’ I am convinced that it is possible and so I have already created an experience in which the self is going to be strengthened. Understanding of the self requires a great deal of intelligence, a great deal of watchfulness, alertness, watching ceaselessly so that it does not slip away. I, who am very earnest, want to dissolve the self. When I say that, I know it is possible to dissolve the self. The moment I say, ‘I want to dissolve this,’ in that there is still the experiencing of the self, and so the self is strengthened.</p><p id="b47bb2dc-c060-4e36-a428-6ee477d0421d" class="">One can see that the state of creation is not at all the experience of the self. Creation is when the self is not there, because creation is not intellectual, is not of the mind, is not self-projected, is something beyond all experiencing. So is it possible for the mind to be quite still, in a state of non-recognition or non-experiencing, to be in a state in which creation can take place, which means when the self is not there, when the self is absent? Any movement of the mind, positive or negative, is an experience which actually strengthens the “me”. Is it possible for the mind not to recognize? That can only take place when there is complete silence, but not the silence which is an experience of the self and which therefore strengthens the self.Is there an entity apart from the self which looks at the self and dissolves the self? Is there a spiritual entity which supersedes the self and destroys it, which puts it aside? Most religious people think there is such an element. The materialist says, ‘It is impossible for the self to be destroyed; it can only be conditioned and restrained – politically, economically and socially; we can hold it firmly within a certain pattern and we can break it; and therefore it can be made to lead a high life, a moral life, and not to interfere with anything but to follow the social pattern and to function merely as a machine.’ That we know. There are other people, the so-called religious ones – they are not really religious, though we call them so – who say, ‘Fundamentally there is such an element; if we can get in touch with it, it will dissolve the self.’ Is there such an element to dissolve the self? Please see what we are doing. We are forcing the self into a corner. If you allow yourself to be forced into the corner, you will see what will happen. We should like there to be an element which is timeless, which is not of the self, which we hope will come and intercede and destroy the self, and which we call God. Now is there such a thing which the mind can conceive? There may be or there may not be; that is not the point.</p><p id="96f4729a-7e71-4d3d-a801-a3dce6cd0b4a" class="">If you and I as individuals can see the whole working of the self, then we shall know what love is.</p><p id="6e59e55f-f7c5-45b2-873d-871c997473f6" class="">When the mind seeks a timeless spiritual state which will go into action in order to destroy the self, is that not another form of experience which is strengthening the “me”? When you believe, is that not what is actually taking place? When you believe that there is truth, God, the timeless state, immortality, is that not the process of strengthening the self? The self has projected that thing which you feel and believe will come and destroy the self. So, having projected this idea of continuance in a timeless state as a spiritual entity, you have an experience. Such experience only strengthens the self, and therefore what have you done? You have not really destroyed the self but only given it a different name, a different quality. The self is still there, because you have experienced it. Thus our action from the beginning to the end is the same action, only we think it is evolving, growing, becoming more and more beautiful. But it is the same action going on, the same “me” functioning at different levels with different labels, different names.</p><p id="798421b0-efe7-44a0-8783-a578dd49c40d" class="">When you see the whole process, the cunning, extraordinary inventions, the intelligence of the self, how it covers itself up through identification, through virtue, through experience, through belief, through knowledge; when you see that the mind is moving in a circle, in a cage of its own making, what happens? When you are aware of it, fully cognizant of it, then are you not extraordinarily quiet? Not through compulsion, not through any reward, not through any fear, when you recognize that every movement of the mind is merely a form of strengthening the self, when you observe it, see it, when you are completely aware of it in action, when you come to that point, not ideologically or verbally, not through projected experiencing, but when you are actually in that state, then you will see that the mind, being utterly still, has no power of creating. Whatever the mind creates is in a circle, within the field of the self. When the mind is non-creating there is creation, which is not a recognizable process.</p><p id="23de2ee5-85ef-4b0d-864a-b0bd1de08a1c" class="">Reality, truth, is not to be recognized. For truth to come, belief, knowledge, experiencing, the pursuit of virtue, all this must go. The virtuous person who is conscious of pursuing virtue can never find reality. He may be a very decent person but that is entirely different from being a man of truth, a man who understands. To the man of truth, truth has come into being. A virtuous man is a righteous man, and a righteous man can never understand what is truth because virtue to him is the covering of the self, the strengthening of the self because he is pursuing virtue. When he says, ‘I must be without greed,’ the state of non-greed which he experiences only strengthens the self. That is why it is so important to be poor, not only in the things of the world but also in belief and in knowledge. A man with worldly riches or a man rich in knowledge and belief will never know anything but darkness, and will be the centre of all mischief and misery. But if you and I as individuals can see the whole working of the self, then we shall know what love is. I assure you that is the only reformation which can possibly change the world. Love is not of the self. Self cannot recognize love. You say, ‘I love,’ but in the very saying of it, in the very experiencing of it, love is not. But when you know love, self is not. When there is love, self is not.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="e59b120d-1f49-4233-b16b-4eed172e01d8" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Experiencing and The Self</strong></summary><p id="2bf33633-6308-48b0-ba62-541e0a7a48ca" class="">Do we know what we mean by the self?

If we are earnest, we should understand this problem of experience. Now what do we mean by experience? We have experience all the time, impressions; and we translate those impressions, and we react or act according to them; we are calculating, cunning, and so on. There is the constant interplay between what is seen objectively and our reaction to it, and interplay between the conscious and the memories of the unconscious.</p><p id="caa68d0c-54d8-43ab-9ea3-0f1f44bc639b" class="">According to my memories, I react to whatever I see, to whatever I feel. In this process of reacting to what I see, what I feel, what I know, what I believe, experience is taking place, is it not? Reaction, response to something seen, is experience. When I see you, I react; the naming of that reaction is experience. If I do not name that reaction it is not an experience. Watch your own responses and what is taking place about you. There is no experience unless there is a naming process going on at the same time. If I do not recognize you, how can I have the experience of meeting you? It sounds simple and right. Is it not a fact? That is if I do not react according to my memories, according to my conditioning, according to my prejudices, how can I know that I have had an experience?</p><p id="b008fbed-c603-41c9-a247-53f2da1f5626" class="">Then there is the projection of various desires. I desire to be protected, to have security inwardly; or I desire to have a Master, a guru, a teacher, a God; and I experience that which I have projected; that is I have projected a desire which has taken a form, to which I have given a name; to that I react. It is my projection. It is my naming. That desire which gives me an experience makes me say: ‘I have experience’, ‘I have met the Master’, or ‘I have not met the Master’. You know the whole process of naming an experience. Desire is what you call experience, is it not?</p><p id="c32e0cfa-8f64-430a-b832-3af291c6e89f" class="">When I desire silence of the mind, what is taking place? What happens? I see the importance of having a silent mind, a quiet mind, for various reasons; because the Upanishads have said so, religious scriptures have said so, saints have said it, and also occasionally I myself feel how good it is to be quiet, because my mind is so very chatty all the day. At times I feel how nice, how pleasurable it is to have a peaceful mind, a silent mind. The desire is to experience silence. I want to have a silent mind, and so I ask ‘How can I get it?’ I know what this or that book says about meditation, and the various forms of discipline. So through discipline I seek to experience silence. The self, the ‘me’, has therefore established itself in the experience of silence.</p><p id="79f2cfa5-f88d-44ba-9188-ff3037fdb226" class="">I want to understand what is truth; that is my desire, my longing; then there follows my projection of what I consider to be the truth, because I have read lots about it; I have heard many people talk about it; religious scriptures have described it. I want all that. What happens? The very want, the very desire is projected, and I experience because I recognize that projected state. If I did not recognize that state, I would not call it truth. I recognize it and I experience it; and that experience gives strength to the self, to the ‘me’, does it not? So the self becomes entrenched in the experience. Then you say ‘I know’, ‘the Master exists’, ‘there is God’ or ‘there is no God; you say that a particular political system is right and all others are not.</p><p id="74241a34-3af7-47aa-add8-d62f5179eb45" class="">So experience is always strengthening the ‘me’. The more you are entrenched in your experience, the more does the self get strengthened. As a result of this, you have a certa1n strength of character, strength of knowledge, of belief, which you display to other people because you know they are not as clever as you are, and because you have the gift of the pen or of speech and you are cunning. Because the self is still acting, so your beliefs, your Masters, your castes, your economic system are all a process of isolation, and they therefore bring contention. You must, if you are at all serious or earnest in this, dissolve this centre completely and not justify it. That is why we must understand the process of experience.</p><p id="e07e502d-15f3-4d2c-821d-134e0c58e4d3" class="">Is it possible for the mind, fur the self, not to project, not to desire, not to experience? We see that all experiences of the self are a negation, a destruction, and yet we call them positive action, don’t we? That is what we call the positive way of life. To undo this whole process is, to you, negation. Are you right in that? Can we, you and I, as individuals, go to the root of it and understand the process of the self? Now what brings about dissolution of the self? Religious and other groups have offered identification, have they not? ‘Identify yourself with a larger, and the self disappears’, is what they say. But surely identification is still the process of the self; the larger is simply the projection of the ‘me’, which I experience and which therefore strengthens the ‘me’.</p><p id="95ce4a75-3dbe-42c5-a82b-79b824b4545f" class="">All the various forms of discipline, belief and knowledge surely only strengthen the self. Can we find an element which will dissolve the self? Or is that a wrong question? That is what we want basically. We want to find something which will dissolve the ‘me’, do we not?

So can I see the ‘me’ wherever it functions, and see its destructive forces and energy? Whatever name I may give to it, it is an isolating force, it is a destructive force, and I want to find a way of dissolving it. You must have asked this yourself – ‘I see the ‘I’ functioning all the time and always bringing anxiety, fear, frustration, despair, misery, not only to myself but to all around me. Is it possible for that self to be dissolved, not partially but completely?’ Can we go to the root of it and destroy it? That is the only way of truly functioning, is it not? I do not want to be partially intelligent but intelligent in an integrated manner. Most of us are intelligent in layers, you probably in one way and I in some other way. Some of you are intelligent in your business work, some others in your office work, and so on; people are intelligent in different ways; but we are not integrally intelligent. To be integrally intelligent means to be without the self. Is it possible?</p><p id="d377b26d-63e8-49f3-9ed6-1bb515befda0" class="">Is it possible for the self to be completely absent now? You know it is possible. What are the necessary ingredients, requirements? What is the element that brings it about? Can I find it? When I put that question ‘Can I find it?’ surely I am convinced that it is possible; so I have already created an experience in which the self is going to be strengthened, is it not? Understanding of the self requires a great deal of intelligence, a great deal of watchfulness, alertness, watching ceaselessly, so that it does not slip away. I, who am very earnest, want to dissolve the self. When I say that, I know it is possible to dissolve the self. The moment I say, ‘I want to dissolve this’, in that there is still the experiencing of the self; and so the self is strengthened.</p><p id="cb972244-5c6e-4040-bb35-aea8e563b422" class="">So how is it possible for the self not to experience? One can see that the state of creation is not at all the experience of the self Creation is when the self is not there, because creation is not intellectual, is not of the mind, is not self-projected, is something beyond all experiencing. So is it possible for the mind to be quite still, in a state of non-recognition, or non-experiencing, to be in a state in which creation can take place, which means when the self is not there, when the self is absent? The problem is this, is it not? Any movement of the mind, positive or negative, is an experience which actually strengthens the ‘me’. Is it possible for the mind not to recognize? That can only take place when there is complete silence, but not the silence which is an experience of the self and which therefore strengthens the self.</p><p id="538f1989-772b-4c59-8c05-61e08c115633" class="">Is there an entity apart from the self which looks at the self and dissolves the self? Is there a spiritual entity which supersedes the self and destroys it, which puts it aside? We think there is, don’t we? Most religious people think there is such an element. The materialist says, ‘It is impossible for the self to be destroyed; it can only be conditioned and restrained – politically, economically and socially; we can hold it firmly within a certain pattern and we can break it; and therefore it can be made to lead a high life, a moral life, and not to interfere with anything but to follow the social pattern, and to function merely as a machine’. That we know. There are other people, the so-called religious ones – they are not really religious, though we call them so – who say, ‘Fundamentally, there is such an element. If we can get into touch with it, it will dissolve the self’.</p><p id="39a72b9b-25d2-4609-8597-06a1d77f2c82" class="">Is there such an element to dissolve the self? Please see what we are doing. We are forcing the self into a corner. If you allow yourself to be forced into the corner, you will see what will happen. We should like there to be an element which is timeless, which is not of the self, which, we hope, will come and intercede and destroy the self – and which we call God. Now is there such a thing which the mind can conceive? There may be or there may not be; that is not the point.</p><p id="496c13e8-0093-4dbf-a639-634b61a2ae56" class="">But when the mind seeks a timeless spiritual state which will go into action in order to destroy the self is that not another form of experience which is strengthening the ‘me’? When you believe, is that not what is actually taking place? When you believe that there is truth, God, the timeless state, immortality, is that not the process of strengthening the self? The self has projected that thing which you feel and believe will come and destroy the self. So, having projected this idea of continuance in a timeless state as a spiritual entity, you have an experience; and such experience only strengthens the self; and therefore what have you done? You have not really destroyed the self but only given it a different name, a different quality; the self is still there, because you have experienced it. Thus our action from the beginning to the end is the same action, only we think it is evolving, growing, becoming more and more beautiful; but, if you observe inwardly, it is the same action going on, the same ‘me’ functioning at different levels with different labels, different names.</p><p id="1f1f1b28-56ee-4944-8d32-0a72ede3c1b1" class="">When you see the whole process, the cunning, extraordinary inventions, the intelligence of the self, how it covers itself up through identification, through virtue, through experience, through belief, through knowledge; when you see that the mind is moving in a circle, in a cage of its own making, what happens? When you are aware of it, fully cognizant of it, then are you not extraordinarily quiet – not through compulsion, not through any reward, not through any fear? When you recognize that every movement of the mind is merely a form of strengthening the self when you observe it, see it, when you are completely aware of it in action, when you come to that point – not ideologically, verbally, not through projected experiencing, but when you are actually in that state – then you will see that the mind, being utterly still, has no power of creating. Whatever the mind creates is in a circle, within the field of the self. When the mind is non-creating there is creation, which is not a recognizable process.</p><p id="f28c503c-67fb-42ac-9e9f-5a2ffc70916e" class="">Reality, truth, is not to be recognized. For truth to come, belief, knowledge, experiencing, the pursuit of virtue – all this must go. The virtuous person who is conscious of pursuing virtue can never find reality. He may be a very decent person; but that is entirely different from being a man of truth, a man who understands. To the man of truth, truth has come into being. A virtuous man is a righteous man, and a righteous man can never understand what is truth because virtue to him is the covering of the self the strengthening of the self because he is pursuing virtue. When he says ‘I must be without greed’, the state of non-greed which he experiences only strengthens the self. That is why it is so important to be poor, not only in the things of the world but also in belief and in knowledge. A man with worldly riches or a man rich in knowledge and belief will never know anything but darkness, and will be the centre of all mischief and misery. But if you and I, as individuals, can see this whole working of the self, then we shall know what love is. I assure you that is the only reformation which can possibly change the world. Love is not of the self. Self cannot recognize love. You say ‘I love; but then, in the very saying of it, in the very experiencing of it, love is not. But, when you know love, self is not. When there is love, self is not.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="92250893-0a32-4e95-aab4-56e1f121d54f" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Understanding our Responsibility in this World</strong></summary><p id="2c1d7df4-5717-45f0-916f-c5ce8065962d" class="">Understanding our Responsibility in this World: The exploration into our responsibility in the world addresses the profound interconnectedness of humanity and the impact of individual actions on global phenomena.

In a world that is so utterly confused and divided, in a world that is so violent and brutal, one would have thought that our main interest in life would be to bring about this order, not only in ourselves but also outwardly.</p><p id="e76e3f36-fe10-4221-9ce0-cc64441f15f7" class="">Order is not habit; habit becomes automatic and loses all its vitality when human beings merely become orderly in the mechanical sense. Order, as we were saying, covers not only our own particular life but also all the life about us, outwardly, in the world, and deeply inwardly. Now, being aware of this disorder, this confusion, how is one to bring about order in oneself without any conflict and without it becoming merely habitual, a routine, mechanical and neurotic? One has observed those people who are very orderly; they have a certain rigidity, they have no pliability; they are not quick and have become rather hard, self-centred, because they are following a particular pattern which they consider to be order; and gradually that becomes a neurotic state. So being aware that this kind of order (which is disorder) becomes mechanical and leads to neurosis, nevertheless one realizes that one must have order in one’s life. Then how is this to come about? That is what we are going to consider together.</p><p id="4ebfdebe-960e-4a67-8b3b-2a23a105b0fc" class="">One must have physical order. It is essential to have a well-disciplined, sensitive, alert body, because that reacts on the mind. And how is one to have a highly sensitive organism that doesn’t become rigid, hard, forced into a particular pattern or design – which the mind thinks is orderly and so forces the body to conform to. This is one of the problems.</p><p id="ed870095-c16a-454a-992a-ad843c3319e9" class="">Then there must be order in the whole totality of the mind, of the brain. The mind is the capacity to understand, the ability to observe logically, sanely, to function totally, all round, not fragmentarily, not to be caught in contradictory desires, purposes and intentions. How is this whole quality of mind to have total order, psychosomatic order without conformity, without the enforcement of a thought-up discipline?</p><p id="49c50412-ddfd-401a-9dbc-5a40258a0fdc" class="">See our difficulty first, what is involved in all this. One has to have order; this is absolutely essential. We are going to investigate together what we mean by that order. There is the order of the older generation, which is really total disorder as one observes its activities throughout the world, in business, in religion, in the economic field, amongst nations and everywhere else; there is total disorder.</p><p id="647954b4-eb80-4b4a-a6f0-35bc1e90c8c4" class="">In reaction to that there is the permissive society, the younger generation, who do quite the opposite to the older generation, which is also disorder – isn’t it? A reaction is disorder. And how is the mind, with all its subtleties of thought, with all the images thought has built, the images that it has built about another, and the images about itself, the images of the “what is” and the “what should be” (therefore living in a state of contradiction), how is such a mind to have complete, total order within itself, so that there is no fragmentation, no reaction to a pattern and no contradiction of the opposites out of which arises violence? Now, seeing all this, how is the mind, your mind, to have complete, total order in action and in thought, in every movement both psychologically and physiologically?</p><p id="4031fe95-e727-4ec5-abe3-d9108c866419" class="">Religious people have said that you can only have order through belief in a higher life, through belief in God, belief in something outside, and that you must conform, adjust, imitate according to that belief; that through discipline you must force your whole nature and change the structure of the psyche, as well as your physiological state. They have said all this. And there is a group of behaviourists who say that environment forces you to behave; if you don’t behave properly then it destroys you. And people live that way, according to their own particular belief, whether it be the communist belief, some religious belief or a sociological, economic belief.</p><p id="b83604c4-6d77-42b0-8431-6f010562712c" class="">In spite of this division in the world, the contradiction in ourselves as well as in society, and the counter culture against the existing culture, they all say that there must be order in the world; the military say it and so do the priests. And is order mechanical? Can order be brought about through discipline? Can order be brought about through conformity, imitation and control? Or, is there an order that has nothing whatever to do with control, with discipline as we know it, that has nothing whatever to do with conformity, with adjustment and so on?</p><p id="e895bc55-2fba-47ae-80da-b4b65b8ee670" class="">Let us look at this whole idea of control and find out whether it does bring order (which doesn’t mean we are talking against control). We are trying to understand; and if we understand, we may discover something entirely different. I hope you are following all this and that you are as interested in it and as passionate about it as I am. It is utterly useless to listen casually to some theoretical idea; we are not discussing theories or hypotheses; we are observing actually what is going on, seeing what is false. The very perception of seeing what is false is the truth. Do you understand?</p><p id="afdc18e1-9a41-4834-be6c-c79a7fe0f889" class="">Now what is implied in control? All our culture, all our education and the upbringing of our children is based on that; and in ourselves there is this urge to control. Now what is implied in that? We have never asked ourselves why we should control at all? Now, let us go into this question. Control implies, does it not, a controller and the thing to be controlled. Please give your attention to this. I am angry and I must control my anger; and where there is control, there is conflict; “I must” and “I must not”. And conflict obviously distorts the mind. A mind is healthy when it has no conflict at all; then it can function without any friction and such a mind is a sane, clear mind, but control denies that, because in control there is conflict and contradiction, there is the desire to imitate and to conform to a pattern – the thing you think you ought to do. Is this clear?</p><p id="e1fe7180-8ad4-4595-88d9-77ec332b5720" class="">So control is not order. This is very important to understand. One can never have order through control, because order implies functioning clearly, seeing wholly, without any distortion; but where there is conflict, there must be distortion. Control also implies suppression, conformity, adjustment and the division between the observer and the observed. We are going to find out what it is to act or bring about order without control. Not that we are denying the whole structure of control, but we are seeing the falseness of it and, therefore, out of that comes the truth of order. Are we following each other, not verbally but actually doing it as we go along, because we are trying to create an entirely different world, a different culture, to bring about a human being who lives without friction? It is only such a mind which is capable of living without distortion that knows what love is. And control in any form does breed distortion, conflict and an unhealthy mind.</p><p id="8e72937b-31af-4b6a-a363-57f5b1e56316" class="">The old culture has said that you must discipline, and this discipline begins with children at home, then in schools and colleges and right the way through life. Now that word “discipline” means to learn; it does not mean drilling, conforming, suppressing and so on. And a mind that is learning all the time, is actually in a state of order, but the mind that is not learning, which says “I have learnt”, such a mind brings disorder. The mind itself resists being drilled, becoming mechanical, conforming and suppressing, which is all implied by discipline. And yet we said there must be order. How is this order to come into being without discipline in the accepted sense of that word?</p><p id="82a740cc-a464-4700-b7c9-f5c60bda9a87" class="">Seeing the problem, which is very complex, what is your answer? If you are exercising your mind, if you are really deeply interested in this question of order, not only inwardly in yourself but also outwardly, what is your response to it? How do you find an answer to this urge for order, which does not depend on control, on discipline, on conformity and that totally denies all authority – which is freedom, isn’t it? If there is any form of authority, then in the acceptance of that authority there is conformity, there is a following; and that breeds contradiction and therefore disorder.</p><p id="1eef7377-2181-4a2b-b3ba-a5c8f99ccd99" class="">So, no control, in the usual meaning of that word “discipline”, and a total denial of the whole structure and nature of authority, which negates freedom. And yet there must be order; see the complications of it. There is the authority of law, of the policeman, the civil authority that one must abide by; but there must be freedom from the authority of the elders with their beliefs, and the authority of one’s own demands, experience, knowledge; because all that denies freedom.</p><p id="37ab8163-3873-487f-b230-78824367109a" class="">Seeing the actual state of the world as it is, observing our culture, social, economic and religious, our educational system and the family relationship, we see that they are all based on this authority. And it has caused utter confusion, great suffering, wars and the fragmentation of the world, as well as the division of man. Observing this, how is one to bring about order? That is your problem – you understand? How will you answer that question if you are really deeply, passionately, interested in trying to bring order to your life, as well as outwardly? What will your answer be? Will you turn to books, to the priests, to the philosophers, to the gurus, to the latest person who says, “I am enlightened, come and I’ll tell you all about it?” To whom will you turn – to find out how to live a life that is totally orderly, denying all conformity, all authority, all discipline and control? You have to answer this question. We are coming to the problem afresh, that is, afresh in the sense that we don’t know how to bring order out of this chaos. If you say, order should be this or that, then you are reacting to “what is”, you are stating something which is in opposition to “what is”, a reaction that has no validity whatever. So we are approaching the problem anew; we have so far only examined the actual fact of what is going on in the world and in ourselves, the actual fact. Now, we are going to find out together what order is. You are not accepting anything the speaker says, be quite sure about this, because if you do, then our relationship changes entirely. But if we are examining together, being totally interested in this issue, which is, that realizing the state of confusion in the world, and seeing the disorder in ourselves, in all our lives, how tawdry they are, realizing the actual fact of this, then we need intensity and passion to discover what is order.</p><p id="262b4de9-a322-4619-82b9-c2e8749f469c" class="">We are going to find out, first of all, what it means to learn by observing “What is” and learning from that. Learning means the active present of that verb to learn, which is a constant movement of learning, not having learnt and then applying that knowledge, which is something quite different from learning all the time. Do you see the difference? We are learning together; we are not storing up knowledge and then acting according to that knowledge; in that there is contradiction and therefore control, whereas a mind that is constantly learning has no authority, no contradiction, no control, no discipline, but the very learning itself demands order. Please observe yourself. Are you in a state of learning – or waiting to be told what order is? Do watch yourself. If you are waiting to find out from another what order is, then you are dependent on that person, or on that book, or on that priest, or on that structure and so on. So we are learning together. Is that your state of mind, that you have understood control and all its implications, understood the full significance of discipline and also you are completely aware of what authority entails? If you have understood, then you are free; otherwise you cannot learn. Learning means a mind that is curious, that doesn’t know, that is eager to find out, interested. Is your mind like that, interested? Are you saying I don’t know what order is but I am going to find out? Are you very curious, passionate and deeply interested, is your mind like that and, therefore, willing to learn, not from another but to learn for yourself by the act of observation? Control and authority, which to you mean discipline, prevent observation. Do you see this? A mind can only learn when it is free, when it doesn’t know, otherwise you cannot learn.</p><p id="7beb088e-8307-405e-afe5-383e0f1de402" class="">So, is your mind free to observe the world and observe yourself? You cannot observe if you are saying “This is right” and “This is wrong”, “I must control”, “I must suppress”, “I must obey”, “I must disobey” – you follow? And, if you are saying that I must live a permissive life, then you are not free to learn; if you are conforming, you are not free to learn. Are you conforming when you have long hair? Am I conforming because I put on a shirt and trousers? please find out. Conformity is not merely to a national pattern, to a particular structure of a society or to a belief, but there is conformity in little things. And such a mind is incapable of learning, because behind this conformity there is this enormous sense of fear; the young have it as well as the old and that is why they conform. If all that is going on, you are not free to learn.</p><p id="322baf40-f926-4000-a296-426b07d0c74b" class="">And there must be order, something living and beautiful, not a mechanical thing – the order of the universe, the order that exists in mathematics, the order that exists in nature, in the relationship between various animals, an order that human beings have totally denied, because in ourselves we are in disorder, which means that we are fragmentary, contradictory, frightened and all the rest of it.</p><p id="5de6af4e-ae0f-4642-accd-4d77f9d52531" class="">Now, I am asking myself, and you are asking yourself, whether the mind is capable of learning, because it doesn’t know what order is. It knows reaction to disorder, but the mind must discover whether it is actually capable of learning without reaction and can therefore be free to observe. In other words, is your mind aware of the problem of control, of discipline, of authority and the constant response of reaction – are you aware of that whole structure? Are you aware of all this in yourself as you live from day to day? Or are you only aware when it is pointed out to you? please see the difference. If you are aware of this whole problem of confusion, discipline, control and suppression, which is conformity, because you have been observing, living, and watching, then it is your own; the other is second-hand. Now which is it?</p><p id="ae503b38-4cae-4817-880c-599df0ee822a" class="">For most of us, it is second-hand, because we are second-hand people, aren’t we? All our knowledge is second-hand, our traditions are second-hand; there may perhaps be a few activities that are totally our own and not of another. So, are we aware that it is our own direct perception, and not second-hand knowledge learnt from another? Now, if it is learnt from another, one has to discard that totally, hasn’t one? You have to discard all that has been said just now by the speaker about the implications of control, discipline, authority and so on; then you become aware that what has been pointed out to you must be totally rejected in order to learn. If you have rejected what others, including the speaker, have said, then you are actually learning, aren’t you?</p><p id="bf4a6206-f229-4d2f-975a-d6f7fedd29c4" class="">Now, let’s find out together what order means. How do you find out what order is when you don’t know anything about it? You can only do this by enquiring into the state of the mind that is trying to find out what order is. I only know what disorder is, I am completely familiar with it, the whole culture of disorder in this present society; I know it very well. But I don’t know what order is; I can imagine what order is; I can theorize about it, but theories, imagination, speculation are not order; therefore I discard all that. So, I really don’t know what order is.</p><p id="cc9e46a9-f7bc-406c-9726-8a320d12d5d0" class="">My mind knows what disorder is, how it has come into being through the culture and the conditioning of that culture and of the human beings; I am aware of all that which is total disorder. Now I really don’t know what order is, so what is the state of the mind that says I don’t know? What is the state of your own mind that says, “I really don’t know?” Is that state of mind waiting for an answer, waiting to be told, expecting to find order? If it is waiting, expecting to be told, then it is not the state which we are talking about, the state of not knowing. The state of “not knowing” is not waiting to be told, it is not expecting an answer; it is terribly alive, active, but it does not know; it knows what is disorder and therefore rejects it completely. When such a mind says, ‘I do not know, then it is totally free. It has denied the disorder and because it is free, it has found order. Do you understand this? It is really marvellous if you go into it for yourself.</p><p id="9a69f178-de7c-4c15-958c-f186e2ced6d2" class="">I don’t know what order is and I am not waiting for anybody to tell me. And because my mind has denied everything that is disorder, totally, without holding back a thing, has emptied the cupboard completely, it is free; so it is capable of learning. And when the mind is totally free, which means non-fragmented, then it is in a state of order. Have you understood this? Now, is your mind in total order, otherwise don’t go any further. Nobody, no teacher, no guru, no saviour, no philosopher, can teach you what order is; in denying totally all authority, you are free from fear, and therefore you can find out what order is. Now, are you aware of your mind, of yourself, of your life – not the holiday life sitting here for an hour listening to a talk – but aware of your daily life, of your family life, of your relationship with each other? And in that life are you aware of the daily routine, the monotony, the boredom of going to the office? Are you aware of the quarrels, of the brutalities, of the nagging and the violence, of everything which is the result of a culture that is total disorder, which is your life? You can’t pick and choose out of that disorder what you think is order. Are you aware that your life is disorderly and if you haven’t got the interest, the passion, the intensity, the flame to find order, then you will pick and choose what you think is order out of the disorder. Can you observe yourself with great honesty, without any sense of hypocrisy or double talk, know for yourself that your life is disorderly, and can you put all that aside to find out what order is? You know, putting aside disorder is not so very difficult; we dramatise it, make much of it. But when you see something very dangerous, a precipice, a wild animal, or a man with a gun, you avoid it instantly, don’t you? There is no arguing, no hesitation, no temporising, there is immediate action. In the same way, when you see the danger of disorder, there is instant action which is the total denial of the whole culture which has brought about disorder, which is yourself. That is the main issue.</p></details></li></ul><h1 id="52d58758-136c-4a37-bb17-69b9594de05d" class="">Awareness, Creating Awareness, Attention</h1><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0"><strong>How to Create Awareness</strong></summary><div class="indented"><p id="51bcee45-4f10-4ea5-bb5b-10df447491e9" class=""><strong>Step 1: Awareness of the Body</strong></p><p id="2d12d8a5-af80-402d-b9c8-84776adb5908" class=""><strong>Begin with Observing Your Body:</strong> Start by paying close attention to every movement and gesture of your body.

This fear motivates the mind to deter individuals from meditation and awareness, fostering opposition to those promoting these paths. Unbeknownst to many, their resistance is driven by the mind&#x27;s dread of its own obsolescence, viewing increased consciousness as its demise. However, this end signifies liberation for the individual, offering a life unchained and filled with boundless possibilities. The mind&#x27;s fear is a barrier to discovering life&#x27;s greatest treasure: awareness. Without it, one remains ensnared in perpetual fear and darkness, missing the chance to embrace true freedom that has always been within reach.</p></div></details><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0"><strong>Attention, Order, Disorder</strong></summary><div class="indented"><p id="d0b069bb-5251-4fad-be38-3b877b0c1625" class="">Then, how is one to be attentive? Please follow this. Knowing one is not attentive (knowing one has a certain amount of concentration, which is an exercise of will which excludes and resists, knowing that any form of effort, which again is will, is not attention), how is one to attend? Because if you can give total attention to everything that you do (and you therefore do very little), what you do, you do completely with your heart, with your mind, with your nerves, with everything you have. And how is this attention to come about, naturally, without any effort, with no exercise of the will, without using attention as a means to something else? I hope you are following all this. You know, you are going to find it awfully difficult if you don’t follow this step by step, as you are probably not used to it; you are used to being told what to do, which you do repetitively, and you think you have understood it. But what we are trying to say is something entirely different.</p><p id="7fbf4b23-e24b-4268-96c1-326da6149293" class="">This attention then comes about naturally, easily, when you know you are inattentive – right? When you are aware that you are inattentive, not giving attention, being aware of that fact is being attentive, and you have nothing else to do. Do you understand? Through negation you come to the positive, but not through the pursuit of the positive. When you do things without this action you do things in a state of inattention, and to be aware of action in a state of inattention, is attention. This makes the mind very subtle, makes the mind tremendously alert, because then there is no wastage of energy. Whereas the exercise of will is wastage of energy, just as concentration is.</p><p id="e00d7a6e-158d-42e5-800a-6b46b5765004" class="">We said that this attention is necessary – don’t say, ‘Define what you mean by attention’, you might just as well look it up in a dictionary. We are not going to define it, what we are trying to do is, by denying what is not, to come upon it by yourself. We are saying, this attention is necessary for sensitivity, which is intelligence at the deeper level. Again, these words are difficult because there is no measurement – when you say, ‘deeper’, ‘more’, you are comparing, and comparison is a waste of energy. So, if that is understood, we can use words to convey a meaning which is not comparative but actual.</p><p id="d1922f60-fcb2-44b3-b78e-3947fb6e0c1f" class="">This sensitivity implies intelligence and we need great intelligence to live, to live our daily life, because it is only intelligence that can possibly bring about a total revolution in our psyche, in the very core of our being. And such a mutation is necessary, because man has lived for millions of years in agony, in despair, always battling with himself and with the world. He has invented a peace which is not peace at all; such peace is between two wars, between two conflicts. And as society is getting more and more complex, disorderly, competitive, there must be radical change, not in society, but in the human being who has created society. The human being, as he is, is a very disorderly person, he is very confused; he believes, he doesn’t believe, he has theories and so on and so on; he lives in a state of contradiction. And he has built a society, a culture which is contradictory, with its rich and its poor. There is disorder, not only in our life, but also outwardly in society. And order is completely necessary. You know what is happening in the world – here in India – look at it! What is happening? Colleges are closed, a whole generation of young people is without education; they will be destroyed by politicians quarrelling over some silly division of language. Then there is the Vietnamese war in which human beings are being destroyed for an idea. There are the racial riots in America, terribly destructive things. And in China there is civil war; in Russia, tyranny, suppression of freedom, at best slow liberalisation – there is division between nationalities, separation due to religions, all of which indicate complete disorder. And this disorder is brought about by each one of us; we are responsible. Do please see the responsibility of it. The older generation has made a mess of the world, you have made a terrible mess of the world with your pujas, your gurus, with your gods, with your nationalities, because you are only concerned with earning a livelihood and cultivating part of the brain, the rest you neglect, you discard. Each human being is responsible for this disorder within himself and in the society in which he lives; Communism and other forms of tyranny are not going to bring order, on the contrary they are going to bring about more disorder, because man needs to be free.</p><p id="e18acea2-469d-4795-bb0e-1d55e5e28ed2" class="">So there is disorder. And order is necessary, otherwise there can be no peace at all. And it is only in peace, in quietness, in beauty, that goodness can flower. Order is virtue, not the cultivated virtue of a cunning mind. Order is virtue, and order is a living thing, just as virtue is a living thing. So virtue cannot be practised as things are. We are going to go into this, listen to it. You cannot practise it any more than you can practise humility, or have a method to find out what love is.</p><p id="d7eacfa8-586d-48f3-b9a7-a17fe1f59f6e" class="">Order must exist if we are to find out if there is or is not – a reality that is not of time, something incorruptible, not depending on anything. </p><p id="51601060-7679-44fe-84c7-fa84619b1a74" class="">So order in this sense has the same pattern as mathematics; in the highest mathematics is the highest order, absolute order. And that absolute order, one must have it in oneself. And as virtue cannot be cultivated, put together, so order cannot be engendered, put together by the mind; but what the mind can do is to find out what disorder is. You are following this? You know what is disorder – living in the way we live is total disorder. As things are, each man is out for himself, there is no co-operation, there is no love, there is complete callousness as to what happens in Vietnam or in China, or at your next door neighbour’s. Be aware of this disorder, and out of the understanding of this disorder understand how it has come about, the cause of it, so that when you understand the causes, the forces that are at work bringing about this disorder, understand it truly, not merely intellectually; then out of that understanding will come order. Now let us try to understand disorder, which is our daily life, understand it, not intellectually or verbally, but observe it, how one has been separated from others by being a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian (the Christian with his god, with his ideals and the Hindu with his ideals, the Muslim with his own ideals peculiar to him, and so on), observe it, come closely into contact with it, do not have prejudices, otherwise you cannot come directly into contact with another human being.</p><p id="ac8b5219-671f-43d4-ae21-841b4fda69bc" class="">So, out of disorder comes order, and it comes about naturally, freely, easily, with great beauty and vitality, when you are directly in contact with disorder in yourself. You are not in contact with this disorder directly, with yourself, if you do not know how to look at yourself. How to see yourself (we have gone into this question of seeing), how to look at a tree, a flower – because as we said the other day, the act of seeing is the act of love? The act of seeing is action. We will go into this a little bit because this is really very important.</p><p id="58adc9bb-93c9-4d41-a414-c8cbef0634fb" class="">When you give your attention completely, that is, with your mind, with your eyes, with your heart, with your nerves – when you give complete attention, you will find there is no centre at all, there is no observer and therefore there is no division between the observed and the observer, and you eradicate conflict totally, this conflict brought about by separation, by division. It only seems difficult because you are not used to this way of looking at life. It is really quite simple. It is really very simple if you know how to look at a tree, if you know how to see anew the tree, your wife, your husband, your neighbour, if you look anew at the sky with its stars, with its silent depth – look, see and listen, then you have solved the whole problem of understanding, because then there is no ‘understanding’ at all, then there is only a state of mind that has no division, and therefore no conflict.</p><p id="a62a02f2-b2c0-4699-a278-c99fa577d7d4" class="">To come upon this naturally, easily, fully, there must be attention. This attention can only come about easily when you know how to look, how to listen – how to look at a tree, or your wife, or your neighbour, or at the stars, or even at your boss, without any image. The image is, after all, the past – the past, which has been accumulated through experience, pleasant or unpleasant; and with that image you look at your wife, your children, your neighbour, the world; you look with that image at nature. So what is in contact is your memory, the image which has been put together by memory. And that image looks and therefore there is no direct contact. You know when you have pain there is no image, there is only pain, and therefore there is immediate action. You may postpone going to the doctor, but action is involved. In the same way when you look and listen, you know the beauty of immediate action in which there is no conflict whatsoever. That is why it is important to know the art of looking, which is very simple – to look with complete attention, with your heart and with your mind. And attention means love, because you cannot look at that sky and be extraordinarily sensitive if there is a division between yourself and the beauty of that sunset.</p><p id="87563e2a-06b7-4544-a1af-4cc364210c84" class="">This order can only come about when we see, that is actually come into contact with disorder, which is in ourselves, which is us. We are not in disorder – ‘we’ is a state of disorder. Now when you look at yourself without any image about yourself, actually at what you are (not what Shankara, Buddha, Freud, Jung, or X Y Z says, because then you are looking at yourself according to their image), you look at the disorder in yourself, the anger, the brutality, the violence, the stupidity, the indifference, the callousness, the constant drive of ambition with its peculiar cruelty – if you can be aware of that without any image, without any word, and look at it, then you are directly in contact with it. And when there is direct contact there is immediate action. There is immediate action when you have intense pain, and when there is great danger there is instant action. And this instant action is life, not the thing that we have hitherto called life, which is a battlefield, an agony in that battlefield, despair, hidden wants and so on; that is what we have called life. Please do observe this in yourself. Use the speaker as a mirror in which you see yourself now. What the speaker is saying is merely exposing yourself to yourself. And therefore look at this, listen to it and become completely in contact with it, be totally with it, and, if you are, you will see that there is immediate action.</p><p id="752c9db6-9ece-4d97-85fd-9e6e2aae3c98" class="">The past is then destroyed. You know the past is the unconscious. You know what the unconscious is? Don’t go back to Freud, Jung or all the rest of those people, but look at it for yourself and find out, not through empiricism, but actually observe it. The past in you is your tradition, the books that you have read, the racial inheritance as the Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and all the rest of it, and the culture in which you have lived, the temples, the beliefs that have been handed down from generation to generation. This constitutes the propaganda to which you have been subjected, your propaganda; you are slaves to the propaganda of five thousand years. And the Christian is a slave to propaganda of two thousand years. He believes in Jesus Christ and you believe in Krishna, or whatever you do believe in, as the Communist believes in something else. We are the result of propaganda. Do you realize what it means? – words, the influence of others; so there is nothing whatsoever original. And to find out the origin of anything we must have order. Order that can only come about when there is the cessation of total disorder in oneself. Because all of us, at least those who are a little serious and thoughtful and earnest, must have asked whether there is anything sacred at all, anything holy. Of course the answer is that the temple, the mosque, or the church is not holy, is not sacred, nor the images therein.</p><p id="efb96a98-048e-4083-90a4-857153fcd57c" class="">I do not know if you have experimented with yourself. Take a piece of stick, put it on the mantelpiece and every day put a flower in front of it – give it a flower – put in front of it a flower and repeat some words – ‘Coca-Cola’, ‘Amen’, ‘Om’, it doesn’t matter what word – any word you like – listen, don’t laugh it off – do it and you will find out. If you do it, after a month you will see how holy it has become. You have identified yourself with that stick, with that piece of stone or with that piece of idea and you have made it into something sacred, holy. But it is not. You have given it a sense of holiness out of your fear, out of the constant habit of this tradition, giving yourself over, surrendering yourself to something, which you consider holy. The image in the temple is no more holy than a piece of rock by the roadside. So it is very important to find out what is really sacred, what is really holy, if there is such a thing at all.</p><p id="6f53b99a-923e-4543-839d-15aa8eba34fe" class="">You know, man has spoken of this throughout the centuries, seeking something that is imperishable, that is not created by the mind, that is holy in itself, something that is never touched by the past. Man is always seeking that. And man, seeking that, not finding it, has invented religion, organized belief. A serious man has to find out, not through some rock, temple or idea, but he has to find what is really, truly, everlastingly sacred. If you cannot find it, you will always be cruel, you will always be in conflict. And if you will, this evening, listen, perhaps you may come upon it, not through the speaker, not through his words, not through his statements, but you may come upon it when there is discipline through the understanding of disorder. When you watch, see what is disorder; the very seeing of disorder demands attention. Please do follow this. You know, for most of us, discipline is a drill, as it is for the soldier, drill, drill from morning until night so that there is nothing but slavery to a habit. And that is what we call discipline; suppression, control – that is deadly, that is not discipline at all. Discipline is a living thing, it has its own beauty, its own freedom. And this discipline comes naturally, when you know how to look at a tree, how to look at the face of your wife, your husband, when you can see the beauty of a tree or a sunset. To see, to look at that sky, the glow of it, the beauty of the leaves against that glow, the orange colour, the depth of that colour, the swiftness of that colour-see it! To see it you must give your whole attention to it. And to give your whole attention has its own discipline, you don’t want any other discipline. So that thing that attention is a living thing, moving and vital.</p><p id="99f84b19-cf2e-4a33-ba10-090208954013" class="">This attention itself is virtue. You need no other ethical standard, no morality (anyhow you have no morality, except on the one hand the morality that the society which you have built tells you, and on the other hand what you want to do, and neither has anything whatsoever to do with virtue). Virtue is beauty and beauty is love, and without love you have no virtue and therefore no order. So again, if you have done it now, as the speaker is talking about it, looking at that sky with your whole being, that very act of looking has its own discipline and therefore its own virtue, its own order. Then the mind reaches the highest point of absolute order and therefore because it is absolutely orderly, it itself becomes the sacred. I do not know if you understand this. You know, when you love the tree, the bird, the light on the water, when you love your neighbour, your wife, your husband, without jealousy, that love that has never been touched by hate, when there is that love, that love itself is sacred, you have no other thing that can be more so.</p><p id="0fb4318a-d837-4cf3-a170-944a68eab7bd" class="">So there is that sacred thing, not in the things that man has put together, but which comes into being when man cuts himself off entirely from the past, which is memory. This does not mean that man becomes absent-minded, he must have memory in a certain direction, but that memory will be found to be part of this whole state in which there is no relation with the past. And that cessation of the past can only be when you see things as they are and come directly in contact with them – as with that marvellous sunset. Then out of this order, discipline, virtue, there comes into being love. Love is tremendously passionate and therefore it acts immediately. It has no time interval between the seeing and the doing. And when you have that love you can put away all your sacred books, all your gods. And you have to put away your sacred books, your gods, your everyday ambitions, to come upon that love. That is the only sacred thing there is. And to come upon it, goodness must flower. Goodness – you understand, Sirs? – goodness can only flower in freedom, not in tradition. The world needs change, you need tremendous revolution in yourself; the world needs this tremendous revolution (not economic, Communist, bloody revolution that man has tried throughout history, that has only led him to more misery). But we do need fundamental, psychological, revolution, and this revolution is order. And order is peace; and this order, with its virtue and peace, can only come about when you come directly into contact with disorder in your daily life. Then out of that blossoms goodness and then there will be no seeking anymore. For that which is, is sacred.</p></div></details><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0"><strong>Attention and Experiencing</strong></summary><div class="indented"><p id="7fc69bf8-7335-4758-ba52-69fad0d0bacb" class="">In complete attention there is no experiencing. In inattention there is; it is this inattention that gathers experience, multiplying memory, building walls of resistance; it is this inattention that builds up the self-centred activities. Inattention is concentration, which is exclusion, a cutting off; concentration knows distraction and the endless conflict of control and discipline. In the state of inattention, every response to any challenge is inadequate; this inadequacy is experience. Experience makes for insensitivity; dulls the mechanism of thought; thickens the walls of memory, and habit, routine, become the norm. Experience, inattention, is not liberating. Inattention is slow decay.</p><p id="20b74b4a-efaa-4003-9afc-4f0d1c0ea5c5" class="">In complete attention there is no experiencing; there’s no centre which experiences, nor a periphery within which experience can take place. Attention is not concentration which is narrowing, limiting. Total attention includes, never excludes. Superficiality of attention is inattention; total attention includes the superficial and the hidden, the past and its influence on the present, moving into the future. All consciousness is partial, confined, and total attention includes consciousness, with its limitations and so is able to break down the borders, the limitations. All thought is conditioned and thought cannot uncondition itself. Thought is time and experience; it is essentially the result of non-attention.</p><p id="a2ec206f-77ed-4fa3-979f-0fdf8496dc37" class="">What brings about total attention? Not any method nor any system; they bring about a result, promised by them. But total attention is not a result, any more than love is; it cannot be induced, it cannot be brought about by any action. Total attention is the negation of the results of inattention but this negation is not the act of knowing attention. What is false must be denied not because you already know what is true; if you knew what is true the false would not exist. The true is not the opposite of the false; love is not the opposite of hate. Because you know hate, you do not know love. Denial of the false, denial of the things of non-attention is not the outcome of the desire to achieve total attention. Seeing the false as the false and the true as the true and the true in the false is not the result of comparison. To see the false as the false is attention. The false as the false cannot be seen when there is opinion, judgment, evaluation, attachment and so on, which are the result of non-attention. Seeing the whole fabric of non-attention is total attention. An attentive mind is an empty mind.</p><p id="c282f89f-e862-4b90-a2f4-a2ed7e879f2a" class="">The purity of the otherness is its immense and impenetrable strength.

Perhaps this morning we can spend some time in enquiring into this, trying to find out whether there is a vastness, an ecstasy, a life that is unquenchable; without finding that, however virtuous, however orderly, however non-violent one is, life in itself has very little meaning. </p><p id="51a3a468-2894-48fb-8af1-7df8fff6b9a9" class="">Religion in the sense in which we are using that word, where there is no kind of fear or belief – is the quality that makes for a life in which there is no fragmentation whatsoever. If we are going to enquire into that, we must not only be free of all belief, but also we must be very clear about the distorting factor of all effort, direction and purpose. Do see the importance of this; if you are at all serious in this matter it is very important to understand how any form of effort distorts direct perception. And any form of suppression obviously also distorts, as does any form of direction born of choice, of established purpose, created by one’s own desire; all these things make the mind utterly incapable of seeing things as they are.</p><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0">Moving the Attention into the Now</summary><div class="indented"><p id="6c687ca8-9a7a-4be1-88a0-fcace592709e" class="">When you are present, when your attention is fully in the Now, Presence will flow into and transform what you do.

Embrace Your Current Situation:</strong><br/>Often, we resist our present circumstances, dreaming of being elsewhere. Through self-awareness, assess if you&#x27;re content with your here and now. If not, you have three choices: change your situation, leave it, or accept it fully. Taking responsibility for your life means making one of these choices without delay and accepting the outcomes without excuses or negativity.<br/></p><p id="c6670d31-6cb4-4aec-a39c-9715626e91d6" class="">

The dictionary meaning of that word is to ponder over, to think over, to enquire; it means to have a mind that is capable of looking, that is intelligent, that is sane, not perverted or neurotic, not wishing for something from somewhere.</p><p id="e99d74c5-e0f1-4dba-8f85-2e01f5777131" class="">Is there any method, any system, any path which you can pursue and come to the understanding of what meditation, or the perception of reality, is? Unfortunately people come from the East with their systems, methods and so on; they say ‘Do this’ and ‘Don’t do that’. ‘Practice Zen and you will find enlightenment.’ Some of you may have gone to India or Japan and spent years studying, disciplining yourself, trying to become aware of your toe or your nose, practising endlessly. Or you may have repeated certain words in order to calm the mind, so that in that calmness there will be the perception of something beyond thought. These tricks can be practised by a very stupid, dull mind. I am using the word stupid in the sense of a mind that is stupefied. A stupefied mind can practise any of these tricks. You may not be interested in all this, but you have to find out. After you have listened very carefully you may go out into the world and teach people, that may be your vocation and I hope it is. You have to know the whole substance, the meaning, the fullness, the beauty, the ecstasy of all this.</p><p id="59882187-248a-4b48-9cea-a51a909e6661" class="">A dull mind, a mind that has been stupefied by ‘practising’, cannot under any circumstances whatsoever understand what reality is. One must be completely, totally, free of thought. One needs a mind that is not distorted, that is very clear, that is not blunted, that is no longer pursuing a direction, a purpose. You will ask: ‘Is it possible to have this state of mind in which there is no experiencing?’ To ‘experience’ implies an entity who is experiencing; therefore, there is duality: the experiencer and the thing experienced. the observer and the thing observed. Most of us want some kind of deep, marvellous and mystical experience; our own daily experiences are so trivial, so banal, so superficial, we want something electrifying. In that bizarre thought of a marvellous experience, there is this duality of the experiencer and the experience. As long as this duality exists there must be distortion; because the experiencer is the accumulated past with all his knowledge, his memories. Being dissatisfied with that, he wants something much greater, therefore he projects it as idea, and finds that projection; in that there is still duality and distortion.</p><p id="03a7c690-1e96-4325-a65c-1f934e00c1a7" class="">Observe for yourself how the brain operates. It is the storehouse of memory, of the past. This memory is responding all the time, as like and dislike, justifying, condemning and so on; it is responding according; to its conditioning, according to the culture, religion, education, which it has stored. That storehouse of memory, from which thought arises, guides most of our life. It is directing and shaping our lives every minute of every day, consciously or unconsciously; it is generating thought, the ‘me’, which is the very essence of thought and words. Can that brain, with its content of the old, be completely quiet – only wakened when it is necessary to operate, to function, to speak, to act, but the rest of the time completely sterile?</p><p id="342a61f1-665c-4650-8581-2e6ec088c631" class="">Meditation is to find out whether the brain, with all its activities, all its experiences, can be absolutely quiet. Not forced, because the moment you force, there again is duality, the entity that says, ‘I would like to have marvellous experiences, therefore I must force my brain to be quiet’ – you will never do it. But if you begin to enquire, watch, observe, listen to all the movements of thought, its conditioning, its pursuits, its fears, its pleasures, watch how the brain operates, then you will see that the brain becomes extraordinarily quiet; that quietness is not sleep but is tremendously active and therefore quiet. A big dynamo that is working perfectly, hardly makes a sound; it is only when there is friction that there is noise.</p><p id="3b209dba-0e82-4e79-90c9-6dc250ae7f3d" class="">One has to find out whether one’s body can sit or lie completely still, without any movement, not forced. Can the body and the brain be still? – for they are interrelated psychosomatically. There are various practices to make the body still, but again they imply suppression; the body wants to get up and walk, you insist that it must sit quietly, and the battle begins – wanting to go out and wanting to sit still.</p><p id="44f26854-c220-45e2-a94b-3a60add59709" class="">The word ‘yoga’ means ‘to join together’. The very words ‘join together’ are wrong, they imply duality. Probably yoga as a particular series of exercises and breathing was invented in India many thousands of years ago. Its intent is to keep the glands, the nerves and the whole system functioning healthily, without medicine, and highly sensitive. The body needs to be sensitive, otherwise you cannot have a clear brain. You can see the simple fact, that one needs to have a very healthy, sensitive, alert body, and a brain that functions very clearly, non-emotionally, not personally; such a brain can be absolutely quiet. Now, how is this to be brought about? How can the brain, which is so tremendously active – not only during the day-time, but when you go to sleep – be so completely relaxed and completely quiet? Obviously no method will do it, a method implies mechanical repetition, which stupefies and makes the brain dull; and in that dullness you think you have marvellous experiences!</p><p id="c5088358-8ccc-4bc2-802d-48379817048d" class="">How can the brain, which is always chattering to itself, or with others, always judging, evaluating, liking and disliking, turning over all the time – how can that brain be completely still? Do you, for yourself, see the extraordinary importance that the brain should be completely quiet? For the moment it acts it is response of the past, in terms of thought. It is only a brain that is completely still that can observe a cloud, a tree, a flowing river. You can see the extraordinary light on those mountains, yet the brain can be completely still you have noticed this, have you not? How has that happened? The mind, facing something of extraordinary magnitude, like very complex machinery, a marvellous computer, or a magnificent sunset, becomes completely quiet even if only for a split second.</p><p id="b1fe062f-2d29-4113-8ae1-746cbdd8ff3b" class="">You have noticed when you give a child a toy, how the toy absorbs the child, the child is so concerned with it. In the same way, by their greatness, the mountains, the beauty of a tree, the flowing waters, absorb the mind and make it still. But in that case the brain is made still by something. Can the brain be quiet without an outside factor entering into it? Not ‘finding a way’. people hope for the Grace of God, they pray, have faith, become absorbed in Jesus, in this or in that. We see that this absorption by something outside occurs to a dull, a stupefied mind. The brain is active from the moment you wake up until you go to sleep; and even then the activity of the brain is still going on. That activity in the form of dreams is the same movement of the day carried on during sleep. The brain has never a moment’s rest, never does it say, ‘I have finished’. It has carried over the problems which it accumulated during the day into sleep; when you wake up those problems still go on – it is a vicious circle. A brain that is to be quiet must have no dreams at all; when the brain is quiet during sleep there is a totally different quality entering into the mind. How does it happen that the brain which is so tremendously, enthusiastically active, can naturally, easily, be quiet without any effort or suppression? I will show it to you.</p><p id="b27cb0d5-4086-4f64-a43c-858145d941f7" class="">As we said, during the day it is endlessly active. You wake up, you look out of the window and say to yourself, ‘Oh, awful rain’, or ‘It is a marvellous day, but too hot’ you have started! So at that moment, when you look out of the window, don’t say a word; not suppressing words but simply realizing that by saying, ‘What a lovely morning’, or ‘A horrible day’, the brain has started. But if you watch, looking out of the window and not saying a word to yourself – which does not mean you suppress the word just observing without the activity of the brain rushing in, there you have the clue, there you have the key. When the old brain does not respond, there is a quality of the new brain coming into being. You can observe the mountains, the river, the valleys, the shadows, the lovely trees and the marvellous clouds full of light beyond the mountains you can look without a word, without comparing.</p><p id="bac15d0f-fe23-44dd-ab40-d98e2301cfe0" class="">But it becomes much more difficult when you look at another person; there already you have established images. But just to observe! You will see when you so observe, when you see clearly, that action becomes extraordinarily vital; it becomes a complete action which is not carried over to the next minute. You understand?</p><p id="28c418f4-2982-4928-a266-8a2d7b1ce990" class="">One has problems, deep or superficial, not sleeping well, quarrelling with one’s wife, and one carries these problems on from day to day. Dreams are the repetition of these problems, the repetition of fear and pleasure over and over again. That obviously stupefies the mind and makes the brain dull. Now is it possible to end each problem as it arises? – not carrying it over. Take j problem: somebody has insulted me, told me I am a fool; at that moment the old brain responds instantly, saying ‘So are you’. If, before the brain responds, I am completely aware of what has been said something unpleasant – I have an interval, a gap, so that the brain does not immediately jump into the battle. So if you watch the movement of thought in action during the day, you realize that it is breeding problems, and that problems are things which are incomplete, which have to e carried over. But if you watch with a brain that is fairly quiet, en you will see that action becomes complete, instantaneous; there is no carrying over of a problem, no carrying over of the insult or the praise – it is finished. Then, during sleep, the brain no longer carrying on the old activities of the day, it has complete rest. And as the brain is quiet in sleep, there takes place a rejuvenation of its whole structure. A quality of innocency comes into being – and the innocent mind can see what is true; not the complicated mind, not that of the philosopher, or the priest.</p><p id="cf44a9c8-326c-4fb9-a6e8-087d8f402396" class="">The innocent mind implies that whole in which are the body, the heart, the brain and the mind. This innocent mind which is never touched by thought, can see what truth is, what reality is, it can see if there is something beyond measure. That is meditation. To come upon this extraordinary beauty of truth, with its ecstasy, you must lay the foundations. The foundation is the understanding of thought, which breeds fear and sustains pleasure, and the understanding of order and therefore virtue; so that there is freedom from all conflict, aggression, brutality and violence. Once one has laid this foundation of freedom, there is a sensitivity which is supreme intelligence, and the whole of the life one leads becomes entirely different.</p><p id="9e42db03-f97f-44a7-b3e0-5daa7214260e" class="">To see the innocency of the mind, whether it is yours or mine, you must first be innocent. I am not turning the tables on you, Sir. To see the innocency of the mind you need to be free, you need to have no fear and a quality that comes with a brain that is functioning without any effort.</p><p id="d4863b47-ef43-4ab2-93d6-a99d66c59331" class="">Is practising Yoga regularly every day for two hours, not a form of discipline? You know the body tells you when it is tired; the body says to you, ‘Don’t do it this morning’. When we have abused the body by driving it in all kinds of ways, spoiling its own intelligence – by wrong food, smoking, drink, all the rest of it – the body becomes insensitive. And thought says, ‘I must force it’. Such driving of the body, forcing it, compelling it, becomes a discipline. Whereas, when you do these things regularly, easily, without any effort, the regularity of it depends on the sensitivity of the body. You do it one day and the next day the body may be tired and you say, ‘All right, I won’t do it’. It is not a mechanical regularity. All this requires a certain intelligence, not only of the mind, but of the body, and that intelligence will tell you what to do and what not to do.</p></div></details><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0">Portals to access reality and the unmanifested</summary><div class="indented"><p id="fbbef740-7590-4cc6-aec9-e279d5693093" class=""><strong>THE NOW</strong></p><p id="57f9a390-02d1-46a3-9c60-057206e96a46" class="">The Now can be seen as the main portal.

In other words, you feel the God-essence in every creature, every flower, every stone, and you realize: <em>&quot;All </em>that is, is holy.&quot; This is why Jesus, speaking entirely from his essence or Christ identity, says in the Gospel of Thomas: &quot;Split a piece of wood; I am there.

This can start with a very simple thing, such as taking one conscious breath or looking, in a state of intense alertness, at a flower, so that there is no mental commentary running at the same time. There are many ways to create a gap in the incessant stream of thought. This is what meditation is all about. Thought is part of the realm of the manifested. Continuous mind activity keeps you imprisoned in the world of form and becomes an opaque screen that prevents you from becoming conscious of the Unmanifested, conscious of the formless and timeless God-essence in yourself and in all things and all creatures. When you are intensely <em>present, </em>you don&#x27;t need to be concerned about the cessation of thinking, of course, because the mind then stops automatically.

The stronger the feeling of separateness, the more you are bound to the manifested, to the world of separate forms. The more you are bound to the world of form, the harder and more impenetrable your form identity becomes. The portal is closed, and you are cut off from the inner dimension, the dimension of depth. In the state of surrender, your form identity softens and becomes somewhat &quot;transparent,&quot; as it were, so the Unmanifested can shine through you.</p><p id="929f16ae-f882-4c02-9fb0-55e10b614b81" class="">It&#x27;s up to you to open a portal in your life that gives you conscious access to the Unmanifested. Get in touch with the energy field of the inner body, be intensely present, disidentify from the mind, surrender to what <em>is; </em>these are all portals you can use -- but you only need to use one.</p><p id="111412e1-43ca-4a6e-b519-f31ee8e6ffb2" class=""><strong>LOVE?</strong></p><p id="bde6f99c-5f38-4292-a1dd-5dc279496e2c" class="">Love is NOT a portal. It is like this: As soon as one of the portals is open, love is present in you as the &quot;feeling-realization&quot; of oneness. Love isn&#x27;t a portal; it&#x27;s what comes <em>through the </em>portal into this world. As long as you are completely trapped in your form identity, there can be no love. Your task is not to search for love but to find a portal through which love can enter.</p><p id="b02c5b4a-0640-4d7a-a754-79227255297b" class=""><strong>SILENCE</strong></p><p id="c055c220-7195-4707-a88a-b3e0e7c0ffa5" class="">Do you hear that dog barking in the distance? Or that car passing by? Listen carefully. Can you feel the presence of the Unmanifested in that? You can&#x27;t? Look for it in the silence out of which the sounds come and into which they return. Pay more attention to the silence than to the sounds. Paying attention to outer silence creates inner silence: the mind becomes still. A portal is opening up.</p><p id="d4de0440-5df7-40ca-b4cd-4ed598814080" class="">Every sound is born out of silence, dies back into silence, and during its life span is surrounded by silence. Silence enables the sound to be. It is an intrinsic but unmanifested part of every sound, every musical note, every song, every word. The Unmanifested is present in this world as silence. This is why it has been said that nothing in this world is so like God as silence. All you have to do is</p><p id="3b5fac6d-7706-4d36-b0b3-4cdc5984d2f9" class="">pay attention to it. Even during a conversation, become conscious of the gaps between words, the brief silent intervals between sentences. As you do that, the dimension of stillness grows within you. You cannot pay attention to silence without simultaneously becoming still within. Silence without, stillness within. You have entered the Unmanifested.</p><p id="6b0a0862-9953-478e-8858-fd3a83a687f6" class=""><strong>SPACE</strong></p><p id="952aed08-d9aa-4f45-954a-b6ec82951eda" class="">Just as no sound can exist without silence, nothing can exist without no-thing, without the empty space that enables it to be. Every physical object or body has come out of nothing, is surrounded by nothing, and will eventually return to nothing. Not only that, but even inside every physical body there is far more &quot;nothing&quot; than &quot;something.&quot; Physicists tell us that the solidity of matter is an illusion. Even seemingly solid matter, including your physical body, is nearly too percent empty space -- so vast are the distances between the atoms compared to their size. What is more, even inside every atom there is mostly empty space. What is left is more like a vibrational frequency than particles of solid matter, more like a musical note. Buddhists have known that for over z,5oo years. <em>&quot;Form </em>is emptiness, emptiness is form,&quot; states the <em>Heart Sutra, </em>one of the best known ancient Buddhist texts. The essence of all things is emptiness.</p><p id="28b8d6e8-754e-4828-9275-629272b708f6" class="">The Unmanifested is not only present in this world as silence; it also pervades the entire physical universe as space -- from within and without. This is just as easy to miss as silence. Everybody pays attention to the things in space, but who pays attention to space itself?.</p><p id="789cc05a-ced4-4f33-b6a9-56911905a30b" class="">NOTHINGNESS</p><p id="dc61c8f7-dfbb-488c-a11f-498e50983fe7" class="">&quot;Nothing&quot; can only become a portal into the Unmanifested for you if you don&#x27;t try to grasp or understand it.</p><p id="43133cf8-8ac9-4536-8eab-f486531fd567" class="">Space has no &quot;existence.&quot; &quot;To exist&quot; literally means <em>&quot;to </em>stand out.&quot; You cannot understand space because it doesn&#x27;t stand out. Although in itself it has no existence, it enables everything else to exist. Silence has no existence either, nor does the Unmanifested.</p><p id="4de5abd4-7e98-45fb-b50d-fc7f54ea35f7" class="">So what happens if you withdraw attention from the objects in space and become aware of space itself?. What is the essence of this room? The furniture, pictures, and so on are <em>in </em>the room, but they are not the room. The floor, walls, and ceiling define the boundary of the room, but they are not the room either. So what is the essence of the room? Space, of course, empty space. There would be no &quot;room&quot; without it. Since space is &quot;nothing,&quot; we can say that what is <em>not </em>there is more important than what is there. So become aware of the space that is all around you. Don&#x27;t think about it. Feel it, as it were. Pay attention to &quot;nothing.&quot;</p><p id="dce6125d-31c2-4782-bd4f-7fe3510efb95" class="">As you do that, a shift in consciousness takes place inside you. Here is why. The inner equivalent to objects in space such as furniture, walls, and so on are your mind objects: thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And the inner equivalent of space is the consciousness that enables your mind objects to be, just as space allows all things to be. So if you withdraw attention from <em>things -- </em>objects in space -- you automatically withdraw attention from your mind objects as well. In other words: You cannot think <em>and </em>be aware of space -- or of silence, for that matter. By becoming aware of the empty space around you, you simultaneously become aware of the space of no-mind, of pure consciousness: the Unmanifested. This is how the contemplation of space can become a portal for you.</p><p id="23991408-9e11-4d37-b49f-7a7e82bf2483" class="">Space and silence are two aspects of the same thing, the same nothing. They are an externalization of inner space and inner silence, which is stillness: the infinitely creative womb of all existence. Most humans are completely unconscious of this dimension. There is no inner space, no stillness. They are out of balance. In other words, they know the world, or think they do, but they don&#x27;t know God. They identify exclusively with their own physical and psychological form, unconscious of essence. And because every form is highly unstable, they live in fear. This fear causes a deep misperception of themselves and of other humans, a distortion in their vision of the world.</p><p id="e360474a-f67f-4071-95e5-161692573f14" class="">If some cosmic convulsion brought about the end of our world, the Unmanifested would remain totally unaffected by this. <em>A Course in Miracles </em>expresses this truth poignantly: &quot;Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God.&quot;</p><p id="8c71539c-8a81-4409-a31a-16152e0b04c8" class="">If you remain in conscious connection with the Unmanifested, you value, love, and deeply respect the manifested and every life form in it as an expression of the One Life beyond form. You also know that every form is destined to dissolve again and that ultimately nothing out here matters all that much.

You may think that you need more time to understand the past or become free of it, in other words, that the future will eventually free you of the past. This is a delusion. Only the present can free you of the past. More time cannot free you of time. Access the power of Now.

The more attention you give to the past, the more you energize it, and the more likely you are to make a &quot;self&quot; out of it. Don&#x27;t misunderstand: Attention is essential, but not to the past as past. Give attention to the present; give attention to your behavior, to your reactions, moods, thoughts, emotions, fears, and desires as they occur in the present. <em>There&#x27;s the </em>past in you. If you can be present enough to watch all those things, not critically or analytically but nonjudgmentally, then you are dealing with the past and dissolving it through the power of your presence. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You find yourself by coming into the present.</p><p id="7834ac86-8158-4ff7-b06f-4e56965267ff" class=""><em>Isn&#x27;t it helpful to understand the past and so understand why we do certain things, react in certain ways, or why we unconsciously create our particular kind of drama, patterns in relationships, and so on?</em></p><p id="8e398c93-e99c-44fe-8230-983c0e2e5445" class="">As you become more conscious of your present reality, you may suddenly get certain insights as to <em>why </em>your conditioning functions in those particular ways; for example, why your relationships follow certain patterns, and you may remember things that happened in the past or see them more clearly. That is fine and can be helpful, but it is not essential. What is essential is your conscious presence. That dissolves the past. That is the transformative agent. So don&#x27;t seek to understand the past, but be as present as you can. The past cannot survive in your presence. It can only survive in your absence.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="50a86344-d814-4367-b79a-9f5419ceb48f" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>True Nature of Space and Time</summary><p id="b8206911-8bd6-46a9-a06f-d9381f1f6ddd" class="">Now consider this: If there were nothing but silence, it wouldn&#x27;t exist for you; you wouldn&#x27;t know what it is. Only when sound appears does silence come into being. Similarly, if there were only space without any objects in space, it wouldn&#x27;t exist for you. Imagine yourself as a point of consciousness floating in the vastness of space -- no stars, no galaxies, just emptiness. Suddenly, space wouldn&#x27;t be vast anymore; it would not be there at all. There would be no speed, no movement from here to there. At least two points of reference are needed for distance and space to come into being. Space comes into being the moment the One becomes two, and as &quot;two&quot; become the &quot;ten thousand things,&quot; as Lao Tse</p><p id="ac3e8cc7-2e38-4bcc-98df-39b89c71a4b3" class="">calls the manifested world, space becomes more and more vast. So world and space arise simultaneously.</p><p id="07985dda-19d9-41f4-a6bc-98b45a5a40b3" class="">Nothing could <em>be </em>without space, yet space is nothing. Before the universe came into being, before the &quot;big bang&quot; if you like, there wasn&#x27;t a vast empty space waiting to be filled. There was no space, as there was no thing. There was only the Unmanifested -- the One. When the One became &quot;the ten thousand things,&quot; suddenly space seemed to be there and enabled the many to be. Where did it come from? Was it created by God to accommodate the universe? Of course not. Space is no-thing, so it was never created.</p><p id="f46ce794-8f3c-4248-86e5-98060962f604" class="">Go out on a clear night and look up at the sky. The thousands of stars you can see with the naked eye are no more than an infinitesimal fraction of what is there. One thousand million galaxies can already be detected with the most powerful telescopes, each galaxy an &quot;island universe&quot; containing thousands of millions of stars. Yet what is even more awe-inspiring is the infinity of space itself, the depth and stillness that allows all of that magnificence to be. Nothing could be more awe-inspiring and majestic than the inconceivable vastness and stillness of space, and yet what is it? Emptiness, vast emptiness.</p><p id="e38badba-43f0-4628-a1f8-5bfb8159c6fd" class="">What appears to us as space in our universe perceived through the mind and the senses is the Unmanifested itself, externalized. It is the &quot;body&quot; of God. And the greatest miracle is this: That stillness and vastness that enables the universe to be, is not just out there in space -- it is also within you. When you are utterly and totally <em>present, </em>you encounter it as the still inner space of no-mind. Within you, it is vast in depth, not in extension. Spacial extension is ultimately a misperception of infinite depth -- an attribute of the one transcendental reality.</p><p id="0db82978-24dc-463a-b611-01670678c3d9" class=""><em>According to Einstein, space and time are not separate.

He calls it the &quot;space-time continuum.&quot;</em></p><p id="2a2494e8-fa5e-4858-9011-2f453058a660" class="">Yes. What you perceive externally as space and time are ultimately illusory, but they contain a core of truth. They are the two essential attributes of God, infinity and eternity, perceived as if they had an external existence outside you. Within you, both space and time have an inner equivalent that reveals their true nature, as well as your own. Whereas space is the still, infinitely deep realm of no- mind, the inner equivalent of time is presence, awareness of the eternal Now. Remember that there is no distinction between them. When space and time are realized within as the Unmanifested -- no-mind and presence -- external space and time continue to exist for you, but they become much less important. The world, too, continues to exist for you, but it will not bind you anymore.</p><p id="a87f16d9-9608-4fd6-8be4-699185fff5b1" class="">Hence, the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but in transcendence of the world. Just as you would not be conscious of space if there were no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to be realized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying: <em>&quot;If </em>there were no illusion, there would be no enlightenment.&quot; It is through the world and ultimately through <em>you </em>that the Unmanifested knows itself. You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. <em>That is how important you are!</em></p></details></li></ul><ul id="941fc157-a1a5-4a04-9612-1aa93c43ac9c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The esoteric meaning of waiting</summary><p id="f9952c4a-aeed-4f32-b153-137975870a81" class="">In a sense, the state of presence could be compared to waiting. Jesus used the analogy of waiting in some of his parables. This is not the usual bored or restless kind of waiting that is a denial of the present and that I spoke about already. It is not a waiting in which your attention is focused on some point in the future and the present is perceived as an undesirable obstacle that prevents you from having what you want. There is a qualitatively different kind of waiting, one that requires your total alertness. Something could happen at any moment, and if you are not absolutely awake, absolutely still, you will miss it. This is the kind of waiting Jesus talks about. In that state, all your attention is in the Now. There is none left for daydreaming, thinking, remembering, anticipating. There is no tension in it, no fear, just alert presence. You are present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. In that state, the &quot;you&quot; that has a past and a future, the personality if you like, is hardly there anymore. And yet nothing of value is lost. You are still essentially yourself. In fact, you are more fully yourself than you ever were before, or rather it is only <em>now </em>that you are truly yourself.</p><p id="963e7a97-f022-4170-8ef7-292aa8dc000f" class="">&quot;Be like a servant waiting for the return of the master,&quot; says Jesus. The servant does not know at what hour the master is going to come. So he stays awake, alert, poised, still, lest he miss the master&#x27;s arrival. In another parable, Jesus speaks of the five careless (unconscious) women who do not have enough oil (consciousness) to keep their lamps burning (stay present) and so miss the</p><p id="93b4907b-7e26-49dc-8353-dc43547a70c1" class="">bridegroom (the Now) and don&#x27;t get to the wedding feast (enlightenment). These five stand in contrast to the five wise women who have enough oil (stay conscious).</p><p id="adb125c4-7fb7-4551-acf3-0ea3115940b6" class="">Even the men who wrote the Gospels did not understand the meaning of these parables, so the first misinterpretations and distortions crept in as they were written down. With subsequent erroneous interpretations, the real meaning was completely lost. These are parables not about the end of the world but about the end of psychological time. They point to the transcendence of the egoic mind and the possibility of living in an entirely new state of consciousness.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="cee7d9ce-bb18-4579-b094-fcf55d4272d9" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Health Benefits of Being Present</summary><p id="f784bd40-a3c4-41cd-a932-fa289130a654" class="">In the meantime, awareness of the inner body has other benefits in the physical realm. One of them is a significant slowing down of the aging of the physical body.<br/>Whereas the outer body normally appears to grow old and wither fairly quickly, the inner body does not change with time, except that you may feel it more deeply and become it more fully. If you are twenty years old now, the energy field of your inner body will feel just the same when you are eighty. It will be just as vibrantly alive. As soon as your habitual state changes from being out-of- the-body and trapped in your mind to being in-the-body and present in the Now, your physical body will feel lighter, clearer, more alive. As there is more consciousness in the body, its molecular structure actually becomes less dense. More consciousness means a lessening of the illusion of materiality.<br/></p><p id="1d27434a-a7f8-491b-af75-1d14ccc1a096" class="">When you become identified more with the timeless inner body than with the outer body, when presence becomes your normal mode of consciousness and past and future no longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate time anymore in your psyche and in the cells of the body. The accumulation of time as the psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cells&#x27; capacity for self- renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old at a much slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shine through the outer form, and you will not give the appearance of an old person.</p><p id="e114e8ff-7506-4a4f-a20d-2869c292414f" class="">Another benefit of this practice in the physical realm is a great strengthening of the immune system which occurs when you inhabit the body. The more consciousness you bring into the body, the stronger the immune system becomes. It is as if every cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your attention. It is also a potent form of self-healing. Most illnesses creep in when you are not present in the body. If the master is not present in the house, all kinds of shady characters will take up residence there. When you inhabit your body, it will be hard for unwanted guests to enter.<br/>It is not only your physical immune system that becomes strengthened; your psychic immune system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protects you from the negative mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highly contagious. Inhabiting the body protects you not by putting up a shield, but by raising the frequency vibration of your total energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists in what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn&#x27;t enter your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don&#x27;t need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you. Please don&#x27;t just accept or reject what I am saying. Put it to the test.<br/></p><p id="fc81ddcc-8e6e-405c-9aa0-4860ff402071" class="">There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever<br/>you feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective if used when you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus. It will also counteract any disruption of your energy field by some form of negativity. However, it is not a substitute for the moment-to- moment practice of being in the body; otherwise, its effect will only be temporary. Here it is.<br/></p><p id="ffa16054-bc50-4e39-ba2f-26c57f2d1828" class="">When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, &quot;flood&quot; your body with consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present in every cell of your body. Don&#x27;t be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in drawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to the inner body.</p></details></li></ul></div></details><h1 id="1e4db283-2c16-4f4b-8a10-5f72f79a37e6" class="">Thinking and Action</h1><ul id="de671b28-760e-44d4-8df5-644670683723" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Thinking</summary><p id="8c5f563a-7ce6-43de-9914-0cefc03fe992" class="">You believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking.

The term ego means different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created by unconscious identification with the mind.</p><p id="b223fb6c-1a5e-4bc3-b34c-3f8da95ca1f8" class="">To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future are considered important. This total reversal of the truth accounts for the fact that in the ego mode the mind is so dysfunctional. It is always concerned with keeping the past alive, because without it - who are you? It constantly projects itself into the future to ensure its continued survival and to seek some kind of release or fulfillment there. It says: &quot;One day, when this, that, or the other happens, I am going to be okay, happy, at peace.&quot; Even when the ego seems to be concerned with the present, it is not the present that it sees: It misperceives it completely because it looks at it through the eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in the mind-projected future.

We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency; otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind, which has grown into a monster. I will talk about this in more detail later. Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought.</p><p id="b859ba73-9260-4da4-83a8-bd775b1e5b77" class="">Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back to a level below thought, the level of an animal or a plant. In the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind when needed, but in a much more focused and effective way than before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary internal dialogue, and there is inner stillness. When you do use your mind, and particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillate every few minutes or so between thought and stillness, between mind and no-mind. No-mind is consciousness without thought. Only in that way is it possible to think creatively, because only in that way does thought have any real power. Thought alone, when it is no longer connected with the much vaster realm of consciousness, quickly becomes barren, insane, destructive.</p><p id="62f5610a-33f7-4d7c-9259-a9b036753f15" class="">The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information - this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative. All true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness. The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or insight. Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising result of a nation-wide inquiry among America&#x27;s most eminent mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinking &quot;plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself.&quot; So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don&#x27;t know how to think but because they don&#x27;t know how to stop thinking!<br/>It wasn&#x27;t through the mind, through thinking, that the miracle that is life on earth or your body were created and are being sustained.

How can a single human cell measuring 1/1,000 of an inch across contain instructions within its DNA that would fill 1,000 books of 600 pages each? The more we learn about the workings of the body, the more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work within it and how little we know. When the mind reconnects with that, it becomes a most wonderful tool. It then serves something greater than itself.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="ce769139-3f59-48a9-858b-22ae048598e1" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Isn&#x27;t thinking essential in order to survive in this world?</strong></summary><p id="f7d04858-1e8a-4600-94dd-11586ab403b0" class="">Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people&#x27;s thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy.</p><p id="c404a814-a92b-442d-b642-15f5cdb22473" class="">This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. What characterizes an addiction? Quite simply this: you no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you. It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns into pain.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="d77a850a-e294-4ee5-bfb4-07b554da279c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Comparing</summary><p id="80aef444-1f67-42cd-af91-8abd34203c85" class="">Here are two facts, one, I am this, the other that I want to be that, whether it is a big thing or a little thing. And that also implies space and time. And the other is getting from here to the house, distance to cover, involving time say to myself, both seem to be true, true in the sense that I have a goal, I want to be powerful, I want to be rich, I want to be famous, and I drive towards that. To become famous takes time, because the image which I have created of fame is there in the distance and I must cover it, through time, because I am not that image now, but I will be in the future. I am not at the house now. I am here. It will take time. And now I want to be famous. Psychologically, that is my projection, the image which I have created of fame. You see that, there it is. I have projected it, it is my image because I have compared other famous people and I want to be like them.</p><p id="c70ab4b1-741c-4d42-b649-c62035e38923" class="">And that implies struggle, competitiveness and ruthlessness. it is an actual thing I want, do I not? I want that and I struggle to get it. I do not question why I have created that image. I do not question what is involved in arriving at that image. I just say, ‘I must be that image’. So in this there is a great deal of conflict, pain, suffering, and brutality. And that is my conditioning, because people have told me from childhood that I must be this, I must pass my exams, I must be a great man, I must be a business man, a lawyer, a professor, whatever it is.</p><p id="c567b1f2-404b-4f1e-a597-c08743f0fdd0" class="">So I have created that image and I have not found out why I have done so.

The ‘tomorrow’ is there in my mind. I am waiting for tomorrow to happen. So there is time (or I think there is). I will be famous. The words ‘will be’ are in the future. So, I ask myself, is there a tomorrow at all? Tomorrow exists only when I want to be something.</p><p id="4d4f1e35-bb4b-4ae6-8985-6756461c19cc" class="">Can man be free from psychological time? Find out for yourself, Sirs; you can see it. If I want to be famous, I cannot be free from time. If I say, I am nobody, and I want to be somebody, I am a slave to time. Now I am nobody, why should I be someone? – I am nobody.</p><p id="bc0d1df0-af9e-47ce-a2c4-430874600c45" class="">The somebody has a bigger car, a bigger house. Don’t let’s mix up words. I am nobody, but I want to be somebody. There is in this the whole process of time. If I do not want to be anybody, is there psychological time? I am what I am. But if I want to change myself into something, then time begins. But I must change, I cannot remain as I am. Are you following all this?</p><p id="d5597675-ff10-454b-8487-2be427ba3b49" class="">Look, I am nobody. Please follow this step by step. I am nobody and I want to be somebody. In that is involved time, pain and the rest. The demand for being somebody, for change from being nobody, that kind of change I discard as it is absurd, unintelligent, immature. So I say, I am nobody. If I remain as nobody, there is nothing. I am nobody, there is nothing in me. But that quality must also change. Those poor chaps in those huts, (I do not know how you can stand those huts around here!) – that poor chap in that hut he is nobody. He cannot become anybody because he is uneducated, he is this and he is that. But he also wants to become somebody because he sees the house next door is a bigger house. So the wanting to be somebody is through comparison. We all look at this through comparison. Now, can the mind eliminate all comparison? Then I will not say, ‘I am nobody’.</p><p id="7111bb0f-7a7c-4e08-bd78-ceb37abd4bce" class="">Why should I project? I want to learn Italian and I will learn it. It will take time and I will work at it. I have to be in New York on the 23rd of this month. I will plan, I will buy a ticket. There is no projection, there is no image, I have to do the practical things that will get me there. But I might say to myself: ‘I am going to New York and it will be much more exciting than living here and all the rest of it’. Now is it possible for the mind not to compare and therefore – but you do not see the beauty of it – and therefore have no time at all. </p><p id="12de66d9-4432-4bca-885d-200ad02f9aef" class="">When you say you are nobody, you have already compared yourself with someone who is somebody. If you eliminate all comparison you will have completely changed. I am still living in that filthy little hut. So the man who lives in that filthy little house, if he comes to this point of saying, ‘All comparison has come to an end’, will be out of that house.</p><p id="30936640-62fe-431a-9e43-aedd215f0e00" class="">If there is no comparison, what takes place? This is the first question; what actually takes place when you do not compare?</p><p id="5f1865c0-d7ef-4b24-b4c3-50674c437243" class="">Look, let us begin. Why do you compare? You begin at school, the teacher tells you you are not doing well, not as well as the other boy. The whole process of examinations, marks and all that is comparison. From childhood you are conditioned to compare, compare the little house with the big house; always comparing. That is your conditioning. And it brings about a series of struggles, of success and failure, of miseries, which society and yourself have imposed. That is your conditioning. You see the poor boy becoming President. That is a tremendous advertisement; and you say, ‘What a marvellous competitive society this is!’ That is our conditioning. And we maintain it because sometimes it is profitable, sometimes it is painful, but it is incurable. We never question why we compare. Please question it now and find out.</p><p id="44cc59ec-2522-4e77-891a-4cd279d75b73" class="">Why do you compare?</p><p id="091d1939-4db2-40b1-b7b1-eb024db0d37f" class="">Take this up – when you feel insufficient you compare. But how do you know that you are insufficient, if you do not compare? Please go into this. Do we compare because we are insufficient? Do we compare because it is part of our conditioning? Every newspaper says, look, so and so is so powerful and you are nobody. So we accept comparison as the norm, as the inevitable process of existence. I do not. Why should I compare? If I do not compare, am I a nobody? I only compare with something superior and therefore I feel inferior. And if I have no comparison I am…</p><p id="1be6758a-1f47-412c-8b0c-353cc6f7cbe0" class="">It has nothing to do with uniqueness. How do I know I am unique? Because I have compared with those people who are not unique? How do I know? To use this word – please Sir, stick to this, it is very interesting to go into it. Look, I compare two pieces of cloth when I buy a coat. Black and White. I compare. I compare this country, saying, ‘It is very hot here; but I can say that this is a very hot country without comparing. If I compare this country with a cooler country, I resist this heat, and then this heat becomes intolerable. Can one eliminate comparison, psychologically, and keep away from comparison with regard to big house, little house, bigger carpet…</p><p id="b0510c87-dc08-468f-adca-d07a4445e2d9" class="">You can see why we compare because, for one thing, we are conditioned, and also through comparison we think we are living. It is part of our struggle; by comparing we feel that we are acting. We say, if I do not compare, if I do not become like Mr. Smith, my God, what shall I be? So comparison is the system in which we have been born, which either says, ‘You must be an executive, you must have millions’, or on the other hand, ‘You must be a saint and have nothing’.</p><p id="606caf9a-8ef6-427f-bed6-c92de6468c0b" class="">“Can one be satisfied with what one is and not be concerned with the neighbour?” Are you really concerned with the neighbour? That neighbour down below? Are you? Obviously not. And you are not satisfied with what you are. The moment you use the word ‘satisfied’ and ‘not satisfied’ there is comparison. Obviously. So, you eliminate altogether words like ‘better’, ‘the more’. So you see, time, psychological time exists only when there is a state of comparison and that includes dissatisfaction, feeling of inferiority, feeling that you must achieve, that you must be – all that is implied in comparison. And when you say, ‘I am nobody’, that word is a comparative word, otherwise you would not use that word. So time, psychological time exists when there is this comparative mind, the mind that measures psychologically. Now, can I, can the mind exist without measuring – exist, live, not just go to sleep – be tremendously active, alive to its fullest depth? That is only possible when there is no comparison.</p><p id="6954b8a0-001a-4c83-a407-93bc169f5d17" class="">Psychological time exists only when there is comparison, when there is a distance to be covered between ‘what is’ and ‘what should be’, which is the desire to become somebody or nobody, all that involves psychological time and the distance to be covered. So one says, is there a tomorrow, psychologically? And this you will not be able to answer. Is there tomorrow – ‘tomorrow’ having come into being because I have had a moment of complete freedom, a complete feeling of something, and it has gone. I would like to keep it, to make it last. Making it last is a form of greed. We struggle to achieve that thing again. All this is implied in psychological time. When you have some experience of joy, of pleasure or whatever it is, live it completely and do not demand that it should endure, because then you are caught in time.</p><p id="0b237528-7798-426c-a0c0-27fab120a139" class="">So, is there tomorrow? That is, tomorrow is ahead and I have had a feeling today of great happiness and want to know if it will last. How can I keep it so that it will always last? Memory of that pleasure makes you want that memory to continue and if it continues, you prevent further experience altogether. It is fairly simple, this.</p><p id="f55eb2e3-1e10-48fd-a129-3147b362d7b2" class="">Low lets have a look into the word resistance. Again, what do you mean by that word ‘resist’? First, let us look at that word, what it means, not what you feel or I think or somebody else thinks – first, see what the word ‘to resist’ means. To resist involves time; to oppose, to resist, to put a barrier, to put it away from you. To resist – I resist the rain, I resist the sunshine, I do not like it, I resist temptation, I resist; I want a bigger house and I say ‘How stupid, I am not going to have it’. So I resist, rebel against something which I want, or don’t want. Why should I resist at all? Please put this to yourself: ‘Why should I resist’? That has been all my life, I have resisted this and I have accepted that, I don’t like this and I like that. So I have built a wall of resistance all round myself, obviously. I don’t want to go into this too deeply but let’s touch on it briefly; I have resisted everything, I have resisted this and that, so I have built a wall around myself, And the wall is the ‘me’ and the ‘me’ is the very essence of resistance. So why do I resist?</p><p id="b6c39fe9-7e41-4d24-9894-481204d31999" class="">I resist. I resist temptation. But what I want to know is why there is resistance at all. Why can’t I look at some. thing and understand it – why should I resist it? Do look at it, Sir – I resist only something which I don’t understand. I say ‘Ecco’ – I understand that. To maintain a particular state I resist; I was happy yesterday and I resist anything that will prevent me having that experience again. If I could look at everything with clarity, then there would be no resistance, would there? If I look with clarity at the process of the modern, or of the old world, there everybody wants to be somebody, or nobody, look at it, see everything involved in it, the pain, ugliness, brutality, failure, and bitterness of it all, if I understand it all then it is finished – I will no longer resist anything. Anything else, Sirs?</p><p id="9183e549-b070-4258-9ccf-0b640e2104ea" class="">Yes, is not freedom from one conditioning a form of another conditioning? If I understand or am aware choicelessly of my conditioning, would I fall into another? Then I recognise all conditioning, whether it is from this or from that, recognise it, understand it, look at it, go into it. You know, it is like those people who go from one religion to another, from one sect to another, and they think they are becoming tremendously religious. But that is childish.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a34218db-5be9-4806-8fae-1c8809fd5dd8" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Beauty arises in the stillness of your presence</summary><p id="8a0d5660-f74b-4f76-b28d-09066204426f" class="">Zen masters use the word <em>satori </em>to describe a flash of insight, a moment of no-mind and total presence. Although <em>satori </em>is not a lasting transformation, be grateful when it comes, for it gives you a taste of enlightenment. You may, indeed, have experienced it many times without knowing what it is and realizing its importance. Presence is needed to become aware of the beauty, the majesty, the sacredness of nature. Have you ever gazed up into the infinity of space on a clear night, awestruck by the absolute stillness and inconceivable vastness of it? Have you listened, truly listened, to the sound of a mountain stream in the forest? Or to the song of a blackbird at dusk on a quiet summer evening? To become aware of such things, the mind needs to be still. You have to put down for a moment your personal baggage of problems, of past and future, as well as all your knowledge; otherwise, you will see but not see, hear but not hear. Your total presence is required.</p><p id="ff5495d7-6428-4f84-acfd-86e0e9d98f1c" class="">Beyond the beauty of the external forms, there is more here: something that cannot be named, something ineffable, some deep, inner, holy essence. Whenever and wherever there is beauty, this inner essence shines through somehow. It only reveals itself to you when you are present. Could it be that this nameless essence and your presence are one and the same? Would it be there without your presence? Go deeply into it. Find out for yourself.</p><p id="43844ff9-929f-4fdf-927b-35b843068f59" class="">When you experienced those moments of presence, you likely didn&#x27;t realize that you were briefly in a state of no-mind. This is because the gap between that state and the influx of thought was too narrow. Your <em>satori </em>may only have lasted for a few seconds before the mind came in, but it was there; otherwise, you would not have experienced the beauty. Mind can neither recognize nor create beauty. Only for a few seconds, while you were completely present, was that beauty or that sacredness there. Because of the narrowness of that gap and a lack of vigilance and alertness on your part, you were probably unable to see the fundamental difference between the perception, the thoughtless awareness of beauty, and the naming and interpreting of it as thought: The time gap was so small that it seemed to be a single process. The truth is, however, that the moment thought came in, all you had was a memory of it.</p><p id="fdebcb07-f9c8-472b-b6a4-58b76098968c" class="">The wider the time gap between perception and thought, the more depth there is to you as a human being, which is to say the more conscious you are.</p><p id="9ad580ed-9bdb-47fd-a1fc-433cd07f5dc6" class="">Many people are so imprisoned in their minds that the beauty of nature does not really exist for them. They might say, &quot;What a pretty flower,&quot; but that&#x27;s just a mechanical mental labeling. Because they are not still, not present, they don&#x27;t truly see the flower, don&#x27;t feel its essence, its holiness -- just as they don&#x27;t know themselves, don&#x27;t feel their own essence, their own holiness.</p><p id="2fd32950-03e5-4757-9d03-b51fd755d02c" class="">Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, most modem art, architecture, music, and literature are devoid of beauty, of inner essence, with very few exceptions. The reason is that the people who create those things cannot -- even for a moment -- free themselves from their mind. So they are never in touch with that place within where true creativity and beauty arise. The mind left to itself creates monstrosities, and not only in art galleries. Look at our urban landscapes and industrial wastelands. No civilization has ever produced so much ugliness.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="c72b7554-57ad-4f3b-a2fb-48b6450c9941" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Accumulation of Knowledge</summary><p id="b50350ec-f7a0-4a61-8cd1-4d651959ccbc" class="">Can one gather wisdom?</p><p id="050e6d23-4ea6-4a54-b2a2-daf3e169f0a7" class="">‘Why not?

Is wisdom that which has continuance? We have knowledge, the accumulation of ages; and why are we not wise, happy, creative? Will knowledge make for bliss? Knowing, which is the accumulation of experience, is not experiencing. Knowing prevents experiencing. The accumulation of experience is a continuous process, and each experience strengthens this process; each experience strengthens memory, gives life to it. Without this constant reaction of memory, memory would soon fade away. Thought is memory, the word, the accumulation of experience. Memory is the past, as consciousness is. This whole burden of the past is the mind, is thought. Thought is the accumulated; and how can thought ever be free to discover the new?

Understanding means action in the present. Have you not noticed that understanding is in the instant, that it is not of time? Do you understand gradually? Understanding is always immediate, now, is it not? Thought is the outcome of the past; it is founded on the past, it is a response of the past. The past is the accumulated, and thought is the response of the accumulation. How, then, can thought ever understand? Is understanding a conscious process? Do you deliberately set out to understand? Do you choose to enjoy the beauty of an evening?</p><p id="2212971c-64fa-4b77-af49-862e7ec603c9" class="">‘But is not understanding a conscious effort?’ What do we mean by consciousness?

Without naming, there would be no experience, would there? This whole process of challenge, response, naming, experience, is consciousness, is it not? Consciousness is always a process of the past. Conscious effort, the will to understand, to gather, the will to be, is a continuation of the past, perhaps modified, but still of the past.

He is thought, he is not separate from thought; he may assume that he is different, pretend to be dissimilar, but that is only the craftiness of thought to give itself permanency. When thought attempts to end thought it only strengthens itself. Do what it will, thought cannot end itself. It is only when the truth of this is seen that thought comes to an end. There is freedom only in seeing the truth of what is, and wisdom is the perception of that truth. The what is is never static, and to be passively watchful of it there must be freedom from all accumulation.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="8b89d92c-87b4-44b2-b2eb-cfafa815c7a1" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Watching the Thinker</summary><p id="b8818e4f-3c0c-41ff-ac5c-61015df9c405" class="">When someone goes to the doctor and says, &quot;I hear a voice in my head,&quot; he or she will most likely be sent to a psychiatrist. The fact is that, in a very similar way, virtually everyone hears a voice, or several voices, in their head all the time: the involuntary thought processes that you don&#x27;t realize you have the power to stop. Continuous monologues or dialogues.<br/>You have probably come across &quot;mad&quot; people in the street incessantly talking or muttering to themselves. Well, that&#x27;s not much different from what you and all other &quot;normal&quot; people do, except that you don&#x27;t do it out loud. The voice comments, speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, dislikes, and so on. The voice isn&#x27;t necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations. Here it often imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is called worry. Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual images or &quot;mental movies.&quot; Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it will interpret it in terms of the past. This is because<br/>the voice belongs to your conditioned mind, which is the result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural mind-set you inherited. So you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person&#x27;s own worst enemy. Many people live with a tormentor in their head that continuously attacks and punishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause of untold misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease.<br/>The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This is the only true liberation. You can take the first step right now. Start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought patterns, those old gramophone records that have been playing in your head perhaps for many years. This is what I mean by &quot;watching the thinker,&quot; which is another way of saying: listen to the voice in your head, be there as the witnessing presence.<br/>When you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially. That is to say, do not judge. Do not judge or condemn what you hear, for doing so would mean that the same voice has come in again through the back door. You&#x27;ll soon realize: there is the voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am realization, this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond the mind.<br/>So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of consciousness has come in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence - your deeper self - behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer<br/></p><p id="b1c8a1e4-b41c-4f70-aacb-1ff3c5e4bea7" class="">energizing the mind through identification with it. This is the beginning of the end of involuntary and compulsive thinking. When a thought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in the mental stream - a gap of &quot;no-mind.&quot; At first, the gaps will be short, a few seconds perhaps, but gradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a certain stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your natural state of felt oneness with Being, which is usually obscured by the mind. With practice, the sense of stillness and peace will deepen. In fact, there is no end to its depth. You will also feel a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep within: the joy of Being.<br/>It is not a trance-like state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the price of peace were a lowering of your consciousness, and the price of stillness a lack of vitality and alertness, then they would not be worth having. In this state of inner connectedness, you are much more alert, more awake than in the mind-identified state. You are fully present. It also raises the vibrational frequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body.<br/>As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in the East, you realize the state of pure consciousness. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as &quot;your self.&quot; That presence is essentially you and at the same time inconceivably greater than you. What I am trying to convey here may sound paradoxical or even contradictory, but there is no other way that I can express it.<br/></p><p id="f4d131d8-db37-44ba-ad27-de75a527e276" class="">Instead of &quot;watching the thinker,&quot; you can also create a gap in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now. Just become intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation. In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity that normally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest attention, so that it becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the stairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, every movement, even your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all the sense perceptions associated with the activity: the sound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent of the soap, and so on. Or when you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for a few seconds and observe the flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent but powerful sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which you can measure your success in this practice: the degree of peace that you feel within.<br/>So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger. One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it.<br/></p></details></li></ul><ul id="402e53c0-63ae-4e01-97a3-89d5db796f6d" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Observation without Analysis</summary><p id="3a983516-ff31-430d-8b9b-d79f36e21fc4" class="">WE ARE GOING to go into this question of analysis. To the speaker, analysis is the denial of action; action being always in the active present. Action means not ‘having done’ or ‘will do’, but doing. Analysis prevents that action in the present, because in analysis there is involved time, a gradual peeling off, as it were, layer after layer, and examining each layer, analysing the content of each layer. And if the analysis is not perfect, complete, true, then that analysis being incomplete, must leave a knowledge which is not total. And the next analysis springs from that which is not complete.</p><p id="ea835bf5-fa7d-461d-ac76-7a3d367ec7a4" class="">Look, I examine myself, analyse myself and if my analysis is not complete, then what I have analysed becomes the knowledge with which I proceed to analyse the next layer. So in that process each analysis becomes incomplete and leads to further conflict, and so to inaction. And in analysis there is the analyser and the analysed, whether the analyser is the professional, or yourself, the layman; there is this duality, the analyser analysing something which he thinks is different from himself. But the analyser, what is he? He is the past, he is the accumulated knowledge of all the things he has analysed. And with that knowledge – which is the past – he analyses the present.</p><p id="3aa4d34c-3791-4631-a47a-0decb274b55a" class="">So in that process there is conflict, there is the struggle to conform, or to force that which he analyses. Also there is this whole process of dreaming. I don’t know whether you have gone into all this yourself, or probably you have read other people’s books, which is most unfortunate; because then you merely repeat what other people have said, however famous they are. But if you don’t read all those books – as the speaker does not – then you have to investigate yourself, then it becomes much more fascinating, much more original, much more direct and true.</p><p id="8e473c7f-76bb-4e93-8e3b-381f51ca6fe6" class="">In the process of analysis there is this world of dreams. We accept dreams as necessary, because the professionals say, ‘You must dream, otherwise you go mad’, and there is some truth in that. We are enquiring into all this because we are trying to find out whether it is possible to change radically, when there is so much confusion, so much misery, such hatred and brutality in the world; there is no compassion. One must, if one is at all serious, enquire into all this. We are enquiring not merely for intellectual entertainment but actually trying to find out if it is possible to change. And when we see the possibility of change, whatever we are, however shallow, however superficial, repetitive, imitative, if we see that there is a possibility of radical change, then we have the energy to do so. If we say it is not possible, then that energy is dissipated.</p><p id="1555ab50-e9c8-46ed-8ad1-f0799e3c063f" class="">So we are enquiring into this question, whether analysis does produce a radical change at all, or whether it is merely an intellectual entertainment, an avoidance of action. As we were saying, analysis implies entering into the world of dreams. What are dreams, how do they come into being? I don’t know if you have gone into this; if you have, you will see that dreams are the continuation of our daily life. What you are doing during the day, all the mischief, the corruption, the hatred, the passing pleasures, the ambition, the guilt and so on, all that is continued in the world of dreams, only in symbols, in pictures and images. These pictures and images have to be interpreted and all the fuss and unreality of all that comes into being.</p><p id="435731f7-1758-476c-908e-49eaaaeac19e" class="">One never asks why should one dream at all. One has accepted dreams as essential, as part of life. Now we are asking ourselves (if you are with me) why we dream at all. Is it possible when you go to sleep to have a mind that is completely quiet? Because it is only in that quiet state that it renews itself, empties itself of all its content, so that it is made fresh, young, decisive, not confused.</p><p id="09287a1e-3f63-42d2-9885-4c37b879f964" class="">If dreams are the continuation of our daily life, of our daily turmoil, anxiety, the desire for security, attachment, then inevitably, dreams in their symbolic form must take place. That is clear, isn’t it? So one asks, ‘Why should one dream at all?’ Can the brain cells be quiet, not carry on all the business of the day?</p><p id="c2c674f8-f067-4fe8-ba9e-0ff03184b0f2" class="">One has to find that out experimentally, not accepting what the speaker says – and for goodness sake don’t ever do that, because we are sharing together, investigating together. You can test it out by being totally aware during the day, watching your thoughts, your motives, your speech, the way you walk and talk. When you are so aware there are the intimations of the unconscious, of the deeper layers, because then you are exposing, inviting the hidden motives, the anxieties, the content of the unconscious to come into the open. So when you go to sleep, you will find that your mind, including the brain, is extraordinarily quiet. It is really resting, because you have finished what you have been doing during the day.</p><p id="cd8fbf44-a05d-49ba-964d-673a416765f6" class="">If you take stock of the day, as you go to bed and lie down – don’t you do this? – saying, ‘I should have done this, I should not have done that’, ‘It would have been better that way, I wish I hadn’t said this’ – when you take stock of the things that have happened during the day, then you are trying to bring about order before you go to sleep. And if you don’t make order before you go to sleep, the brain tries to do it when you are asleep. Because the brain functions perfectly only in order, not in disorder. It functions most efficiently when there is complete order, whether that order is neurotic or rational; because in neurosis, in imbalance, there is order, and the brain accepts that order.</p><p id="4bf1077c-90fa-496b-bed2-c02fee00ea90" class="">So, if you take stock of everything that has been happening during the day before you go to sleep, then you are trying to bring about order, and therefore the brain does not have to bring order while you are asleep: you have done it during the day. You can bring about that order every minute during the day, that is if you are aware of everything that’s happening, outwardly and inwardly. Outwardly in the sense of being aware of the disorder about you, the cruelty, the indifference, the callousness, the dirt, the squalor, the quarrels, the politicians and their chicanery – all that is happening. And your relationship with your husband, your wife, with your girl or boyfriend, be aware of ill that during the day, without correcting it, just be aware of it. The moment you try to correct it, you are bringing disorder. But if you merely observe actually what is, then what is, is order.</p><p id="75c32928-631d-4ce2-9240-6e22beb8a3f0" class="">It is only when you try to change ‘what is’ that there is disorder; because you want to change according to the knowledge which you have acquired. That knowledge is the past and you are trying to change ‘what is’ – which is not the past – according to what you have learnt. Therefore there is a contradiction, therefore there is a distortion, therefore this is disorder.</p><p id="e7b3565a-6ede-4d5a-a0a5-74f0bf145f79" class="">So during the day, if you are aware of the ways of your thoughts, your motives, the hypocrisy, the double-talk – doing one thing, saying another, thinking another – the mask that you put on, the varieties of deception that one has so readily to hand, if you are aware of all that during the day, you don’t have to take stock at all when you go to sleep, you are bringing order each minute. So when you do go to sleep you will find that your brain cells, which have recorded and hold the past, become totally quiet, and your sleep then becomes something entirely different. When we use the word ‘mind’, we include in that the brain, the whole nervous organism, the affections, all the human structure; we mean all that, not something separate. In that is included the intellect, the heart, the whole nervous organism. When you go to sleep then, the process has totally come to an end, and when you wake up you see things exactly as they are, not your interpretation of them or the desire to change them.</p><p id="808142d7-d280-4cc8-929c-ed9b03a14abe" class="">So analysis, for the speaker, prevents action. And action is absolutely essential in order to bring about this radical change. So analysis is not the way. Don’t accept, please, what the speaker is saying, but observe it for yourself, learn about it, not from me, but learn by watching all these implications of analysis: time, the analyser and the analysed – the analyser is the analysed – and each analysis must be complete, otherwise it distorts the next analysis. So to see that the whole process of analyses, whether it is introspective or intellectual analysis, is totally wrong! It is not the way out – maybe it is necessary for those who are somewhat, or greatly, unbalanced; and perhaps most of us are unbalanced.</p><p id="0b8c982b-1451-4e97-8070-fd0a11793fdd" class="">We must find a way of observing the whole content of consciousness without the analyser. It is great fun if you go into this, because you have then rejected totally everything that man has said. Because then you stand alone; when you find out for yourself, it will be authentic, real, true, not dependent on any professor, any psychologist, any analyst and so on.</p><p id="8824eca5-a135-46d9-86d8-090dca772515" class="">So one must find a way of observing without analysis. I’m going to go into that – I hope you don’t mind my doing all this, do you? This is not group therapy! (Laughter) This is not an open confession, it is not that the speaker is analysing you, or making you change and become marvellous human beings! You have to do this yourself, and as most of us are second-hand or third-hand human beings, it is going to be very difficult to put away totally all that has been imposed on your minds by the professionals, whether by religious or scientific professionals. We have to find out for ourselves.</p><p id="2dc3f5e2-8820-48c9-86e3-4b6e153e0707" class="">If analysis is not the way – and it is not, as far as the speaker is concerned, as he has explained – then how is one to examine or to observe the total content of consciousness? What is the content of consciousness? Please don’t repeat what somebody else has said. What is your total content? Have you ever looked at it, considered it? If you have, is it not the various recorded incidents, happenings, pleasurable and non-pleasurable, various beliefs, traditions, the various individual recollections and memories, the racial and family memories, the culture in which one has been brought up – all that is the content, isn’t it? And the incidents that take place every day, the memories, the various pains, the unhappiness, the insults, all that is recorded. And that content is your consciousness – you, as a Catholic, or Protestant, living in this western world with the search for more and more and more, the world of great pleasure, entertainment, wealth, incessant noise of the television, the brutality – all that is you, that’s your content.</p><p id="e829790a-089b-4089-940d-05541e4dafd7" class="">How is all that to be exposed? – and in the exposing of it, is each incident, each happening, each tradition, each hurt, each pain to be examined one by one? Or is it to be looked at totally? If it is to be examined bit by bit, one by one, you are entering into the world of analysis and there is no end to that, you will die analysing – and giving a great deal of money to those who analyse, if that’s your pleasure.</p><p id="49a7b723-d368-469f-b71c-a2d003c37c9c" class="">Now we’re going to find out how to look at these various fragments, which are the content of consciousness, totally – not analytically. We are going to find out how to observe without any analysis at all. That is, we have looked at everything – at the tree, at the cloud, at the wife and the husband, at the girl and the boy – as the observer and the observed. Please do give a little attention to this. You have observed your anger, your greed or your jealousy, whatever it is, as an observer looking at greed. The observer is greed, but you have separated the observer because your mind is conditioned to the analytical process; therefore you are always looking at the tree, at the cloud, at everything in life as an observer and the thing observed. Have you noticed it? You look at your wife through the image which you have of her; that image is the observer, it is the past, that image has been put together through time. And the observer is the time, is the past, is the accumulated knowledge of the various incidents, accidents, happenings, experiences and so on. That observer is the past, and he looks at the thing observed as though he were not of it, but separate from it.</p><p id="f958be7c-71a7-4863-8361-7a4453edd834" class="">Now can you look without the observer? Can you look at the tree without the past as the observer? That is, when there is the observer, then there is space between the observer and the observed – the tree. That space is time, because there is a distance. That time is the quality of the observer, who is the past, who is the accumulated knowledge, who says, ‘That is the tree’, or ‘That is the image of my wife.’</p><p id="1f32e6c0-aa03-46ec-9c9b-09d6052e5fa5" class="">Can you look, not only at the tree, but at your wife or your husband, without the image? You know, this requires tremendous discipline. I am going to show you something: discipline generally implies conformity, drill, imitation, conflict between what is and what should be. And so in discipline there is conflict: suppressing, overcoming, the exercise of will and so on – all that is implied in that word. But that word means to learn – not to conform, not to suppress, but to learn. And the quality of the mind that learns has its own order which is discipline. We are learning now to observe, without the observer, without the past, without the image. When you so observe, the actual ‘what is’, is a living thing, not a thing looked upon as dead, recognizable by the past event, by past knowledge.</p><p id="3a6a7121-93db-4047-811a-99738a1695db" class="">Look, sirs, let’s make it much simpler than this. You say something to me which hurts me, and the pain of that hurt is recorded. The memory of that continues and when there is further pain, it is recorded again. So the hurt is being strengthened from childhood on. Whereas, if I observe it completely, when you say something which is painful to me, then it is not recorded as a hurt. The moment you record it as a hurt, that recording is continued and for the rest of your life you are being hurt, because you are adding to that hurt. Whereas to observe the pain completely without recording it, is to give your total attention at the moment of the pain. Are you doing all this?</p><p id="5937c85d-cc39-489d-8f6e-cd1979587a9a" class="">Look, when you go out, when you walk in these streets, there are all kinds of noise, all kinds of shouting, vulgarity, brutality, this noise is pouring in. That is very destructive – the more sensitive you are the more destructive it becomes, it hurts your organism. You resist that hurt and therefore you build a wall. And when you build a wall you are isolating yourself. Therefore you are strengthening the isolation, by which you will get more and more hurt. Whereas if you are observing that noise, are attentive to that noise, then you will see that your organism is never hurt.</p><p id="3937f179-961b-4712-9fc6-d621dd8d862f" class="">If you understand this one radical principle, you will have understood something immense: that where there is an observer separating himself from the thing he observes, there must be conflict. Do what you will, as long as there is a division between the observer and the observed, there must be conflict. As long as there is division between the Muslim and the Hindu, between the Catholic and the Protestant, between the Black and the White, there must be conflict; you may tolerate each other, which is an intellectual covering of intolerance.</p><p id="d4de8ed2-2276-4f03-8804-550a4e25bafc" class="">As long as there is division between you and your wife, there must be conflict. This division exists fundamentally, basically, as long as there is the observer separate from the thing observed. As long as I say, ‘Anger is different from me, I must control anger, I must change, I must control my thoughts’, in that there is division, therefore there is conflict. Conflict implies suppression, conformity, imitation, all that is involved in it. If you really see the beauty of this, that the observer is the observed, that the two are not separate, then you can observe the totality of consciousness without analysis. Then you see the whole content of it instantly.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="54838eb7-93bd-4895-ae06-bd5dca7ddfdd" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Can we learn from experience?</summary><p id="b5116f92-a163-455f-89bd-921cee904875" class="">Certainly not. Learning implies freedom, curiosity, enquiry. When a child learns something, he is curious about it, he wants to know, it is a free momentum; not a momentum of having acquired and of moving from that acquisition. We have innumerable experiences; we have had five thousand years of wars. We have not learnt a thing from them except to invent more deadly machinery with which to kill each other. We have had many experiences with our friends, with our wives, with our husbands, with our nation – we have not learnt. Learning, in fact, can only take place when there is freedom from experience. When you discover something new, your mind must be free of the old, obviously. For this reason, meditation is the emptying of the mind of the known as experience; because truth is not something that you invent, it is something totally new, it is not in terms of the past ‘known’. Its newness is not the opposite of the old; it is something incredibly new: a mind that comes to it with experience cannot see it.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="bb2fffb5-7e3f-492f-8b89-752361afb7db" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Analysis, Action, Living in This World</summary><p id="5341c74c-9cc9-49ee-9da9-0df195c27002" class="">IT IS REALLY quite important to understand the whole problem of living: from the moment we are born till we die, we are always in conflict. There is always a struggle, not only within ourselves, but outwardly in all our relationships, there is strain and strife; there is constant division, and a sense of the separate individual existence in opposition to the community. In the most intimate relationships, each one is seeking his own pleasure, secretly or openly; each one is pursuing his own ambition and fulfilment, thereby generating frustration. What we call living, is turmoil. In this turmoil we try to be creative. If one is gifted one writes a book or a poem, composes a picture and so on, but all within the pattern of strife, grief and despair; yet this is what is considered creative living. In going to the moon, living under the sea, waging wars, there is this constant bitter strife of man against man. This is our life.</p><p id="a3db7089-e4af-4f4e-8063-dd8141c124b9" class="">It seems to me that we should go into this matter very seriously, very deeply, and if we can, feel our way into a quality of mind where there is no strife whatsoever, both at the conscious level and also in the layers that lie below the conscious.</p><p id="67c66d8a-815a-4a35-95f6-484fad9d0ce1" class="">Beauty is not the result of conflict. When you see the beauty of a mountain or of swift running water, in that immediate reception there is no sense of striving. In our lives there is not much beauty because of the battle that is going on.</p><p id="494f2b18-8f01-4ad0-921d-3af7d7804b96" class="">To find a quality of mind that is essentially beautiful and clear, that has never been touched by strife, is of the greatest importance; in the understanding of that – not merely verbally or intellectually, but in actually living it in daily life – we may have some kind of peace within ourselves and in the world. Perhaps this morning we shall be able, hesitantly and with sensitive watchfulness, to understand this battle we live in, and be free of it.</p><p id="2103dff3-d095-4c9d-bf15-5eeb3c478870" class="">What is the root cause of this conflict and contradiction? Ask this question of yourself. Do not try to put into words an explanation, but simply enquire non-verbally, if you can, into the basis of this contradiction and division, this strife and conflict.</p><p id="43d19c47-6177-4400-89c3-271a54416272" class="">Either you enquire analytically or you perceive immediately the root of it. Analytically, you may unravel bit by bit and come upon the nature, the structure, the cause and effect of this strife within ourselves, between the individual and the State. Or you may perceive the cause of it instantly. In this way we may find out factually the cause of all this conflict and perceive the truth of it instantly.</p><p id="ccf0960e-3fc7-4ab9-8019-8d43391e4151" class="">Let us understand what it means to analyse, to attempt to discover intellectually, verbally, the cause of this conflict. Because once you understand the analytical process – see the truth or the falseness of it – you will be completely free of it for ever; which implies an understanding in which your eyes, your mind, and your heart perceive immediately the truth of the matter. We are used to, conditioned to, the analytical process and the philosophical and psychological approach to the various specialists; it has become a habit. We are conditioned to trying to understand this whole complex process of living analytically, intellectually. This is not to advocate its opposite – emotional sentimentality. But if you understand very clearly the nature and the structure of the analytical process, then you will have quite a different outlook; you will be able to direct the energy which had been given to analysis in a totally different direction.</p><p id="1af55285-84e3-41c4-87ec-64f241bd64d0" class="">Analysis implies division. There is the analyser and that which is to be analysed. Whether you analyse yourself, or it is done by a specialist, there is division, therefore there is already the beginning of conflict. We can do tremendous things only when there is great passion, great energy, and it is only this passion that can create a totally different kind of life in ourselves and in the world. That is why it is very important to understand this process of analysis in which the human mind has been caught for centuries.</p><p id="fafe8ab8-8f28-4eaf-bab1-73a4f7ac0dca" class="">Of the many fragments into which we are divided, one assumes the authority of the analyser; the thing that is to be analysed is another. That analyser becomes the censor; he, with his accumulated knowledge, evaluates the good and the bad, what is right and what is wrong, what should or should not be suppressed, and so on. Also, the analyser must make every analysis complete, otherwise his evaluation, his conclusion, will be partial. The analyser must examine every thought – everything which he thinks should be analysed, and that will take time. You may spend a whole lifetime analysing – if you have the money and the inclination, or if you can find an analyst with whom you are in love, and all the rest of it. You can spend all your days analysing and at the end of it you are where you were, with still more to be analysed.</p><p id="c6eccba2-48c4-43d3-8ef5-7a1db9926c05" class="">We see that in analysis there is the division between the analyser and the analysed, and also that the analyser must analyse accurately, completely, or his conclusions will impede the next analysis. We see that the analytical process takes an infinite time and during that time many other things may happen. So when you see the whole structure of analysis, then that seeing is actually a denial, a negation of it; seeing what is involved in it, there is the negation of that action – which is complete action.</p><p id="948fa168-3cc7-4093-a2fc-0138872c8dc2" class="">Action according to an idea, an ideology, one’s accumulated experience. Action is always approximating itself to the ideal, to the prototype, so there is a division between action and ideal. Such action is never complete, analysis is never complete; the negation of that incomplete action is total action.</p><p id="0c3b3ea4-2fc0-49ec-bf33-fe53131bfd91" class="">When the mind has seen the futility, the meaninglessness of analysis, with all the problems which are involved, it will never touch it; the mind will never seek to understand ‘true’ analysis.</p><p id="11895335-df86-4233-90f6-d1e9e29ed47b" class="">The mind that has looked into the process of analysis has become very sharp, alive, sensitive, because it has rejected that which we had considered to be the way and means of understanding.</p><p id="2fdbba60-094b-4874-847a-6561db08b29a" class="">If you see very clearly for yourself – not forced or compelled by the argument and reasoning of another – the falseness or the truth of analysis, then your mind is free and has the energy to look in another direction. What is the ‘other direction’? It is the immediacy of perception that is total action.</p><p id="937877db-0aa1-443b-a09a-169f88b1dc9c" class="">As we said, there is division between the analyser and the thing to be analysed, division between the observer and the thing observed: this is the root cause of conflict. When you observe, you always do so from a centre, from the background of experience and knowledge; the ‘me’ as the Catholic, the Communist, the ‘specialist, and so on, is observing. So there is a division between ‘me’ and the thing observed. This does not require a great deal of understanding, it is an obvious fact. When you look at a tree, at your husband, or wife, there is this division. It exists between yourself and the community. So there is this observer and the thing observed: in that division there is inevitably contradiction. That contradiction is the root of all strife.</p><p id="06337e04-6d47-44e2-9b59-7e35fde42dd2" class="">If that is the root cause of conflict, then the next question is: can you observe without the ‘me’, the censor, without all the accumulated experiences of misery, conflict, brutality vanity pride, despair, which are the ‘me’? Can you observe without the past – the past memories, conclusions and hopes, without all the background? That background – as the ‘me’, the ‘observer’ – divides you from the observed. Have you ever observed without the background? Do it now, please. Play with it. Look at the outward things objectively; listen to the noise of the river, look at the lines of the mountains, the beauty, the clarity of it all.</p><p id="d92aa987-3fb0-41cd-a57e-1b19a1ecf624" class="">That is fairly easy to do without the ‘me’, as the past, observing. But can you look at yourself inwardly, without the observer? Do, please, look at yourself, your conditioning, your education, your way of thinking, your conclusions, your prejudices, without any kind of condemnation or explanation or justification – just observe. When you so observe there is no ‘observer’ and there. fore no conflict.</p><p id="2e91078b-570c-4d38-8502-dafb26947d15" class="">That way of living is totally different from the other – it is not the opposite, not a reaction to the other, it is entirely different. And in it there is tremendous freedom and an abundance of energy and passion. It is total observation, complete action. When you have completely seen and understood, your action will always be clear. It is like looking at the total extent of the map, not the detail of where you want to go.</p><p id="19eb1085-3a04-49ed-8ecb-2f636bc7cfe7" class="">So one finds out for oneself, as a human being, that it is possible to live without any kind of conflict. This implies an enormous revolution in oneself. That is the only revolution. Every form of physical, outward revolution – political, economic, social – always ends up in dictatorship, either of the bureaucrats or of the idealist or of some conqueror. Whereas this inward, complete and total revolution, which is the outcome of the understanding of all conflict, which is caused by the division between the observer and the observed, brings about a totally different kind of living.</p><p id="a0048e29-3e2f-4e07-8876-43e47716ffc2" class="">You cannot possibly divorce yourself from the world: you are the world. If you live in Christendom, you are conditioned by the culture, by the religion, by the education, by the industrialization, by all the conflicts of its wars. You cannot possibly separate yourself from that world. The monks have tried to withdraw from the world, enclosing themselves in a monastery, but nevertheless, they are the result of the world in which they live; they want to escape from that culture by withdrawing from it, by devoting themselves to what they consider to be the truth, to the ideal of Jesus and so on.</p><p id="b5999364-fb96-4522-964a-94fa31d7f0e1" class="">‘I must have a livelihood in order to survive., The whole structure of society, whether here, or in Russia, is based on survival at any price, doing something which society has set up.

They never said to themselves, ‘Look, how absurd this division is, one believing this and the other believing that; they never saw the absurdity of their conditioning.

So don’t attack the power that is vested in others, but be free of the demand for power in yourself; then your action will be totally different. We want to attack the outward power, tear that power away from the hands of those who have it and give it to somebody else; we do not say to ourselves, ‘Let us be free of all dominance and possession’. If you actually applied your whole mind to be free of every kind of power – which means to function without status – then you would bring about quite a different society.</p><p id="5fc66811-d144-49e3-99b5-0a4456c6f7e4" class="">If you were really hungry you would not be here!

If you were really confronted with the problem would you put that question? You would just be working – you understand Sir?

This is a very complex question. We are conditioned to accept that through gradual inward revolution there will be a change. Does it take place step by step, or does it happen instantly when you see the truth of the matter? When you see instant danger there is instant action is there not? Then your action is not gradual or analytical; when there is danger, there is immediate action. We are pointing out the dangers – the dangers of analysis, the danger of power, of postponement, of division. When you see the real danger of it not verbally, but actually, physically and psychologically – then there is instant action, the action of an instant revolution. To see these psychological dangers you need a sensitive, alert, watchful mind. If you say, ‘How am I to have a watchful, a sensitive mind?’ you are again caught in gradualness. But when you see the necessity as when confronted by danger – and society is danger, all the things you are involved in are dangerous – then there is a total action.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="41552757-3938-4d84-adf7-f9b46a98aee6" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Conflict between what is, and what should be</summary><p id="1703f501-6858-4332-bde6-073ffe239318" class="">‘I AM MARRIED and have children,’ she said, ‘but I seem to have lost all love. I am slowly drying up. Although I engage in social activities, they are a kind of pastime, and I see their futility. Nothing seems to interest me deeply and fully. I recently took a long holiday from my family routine and social activities, and I tried to paint; but my spirit was not in it. I feel utterly dead, uncreative, depressed and deeply discontented. I am still young, but the future seems to be complete blackness. I have thought of suicide, but somehow I see the utter stupidity of it, I am getting more and more confused, and my discontent seems to have no end.’</p><p id="ef145dfc-dc37-48cd-ad7e-2aa6bdbf65f3" class="">What are you confused about? Is your problem that of relationship? ‘No, it is not. I have been through that, and have come out of it not too bruised; but I am confused and nothing seems to satisfy me.’ Have you a definite problem, or are you merely discontented generally? There must be deep down some anxiety, some fear, and probably you are not aware of it. Do you want to know what it is?</p><p id="ea7a611c-4c60-4d2d-9a56-42bd4ac70aef" class="">‘Yes, that is why I have come to you. I really cannot go on the way I am. Nothing seems to be of any importance, and I get quite ill periodically.’ Your illness may be an escape from yourself, from your circumstances. ‘I am pretty sure it is. But what am I to do? I am really quite desperate. Before I leave I must find a way out of all this.’ Is the conflict between two actualities, or between the actual and the fictitious? Is your discontent mere dissatisfaction, which is easily gratified, or is it a causeless misery? Dissatisfaction soon finds a particular channel through which it is gratified; dissatisfaction is quickly canalized, but discontent cannot be assuaged by thought. Does this so-called discontent arise from not finding satisfaction? If you found satisfaction, would your discontent disappear? Is it that you are really seeking some kind of permanent gratification?</p><p id="17144c40-58a0-4fff-a87e-e60777f024e0" class="">‘No, it is not that. I am really not seeking any kind of gratification – at least I do not think I am. All I know is that I am in confusion and conflict, and I cannot seem to find a way out of it.’ When you say you are in conflict, it must be in relation to something: in relation to your husband, to your children, to your activities. If, as you say, your conflict is not with any of these, then it can only be between what you are and what you want to be, between the actual and the ideal, between what is and the myth of what should be. You have an idea of what you should be, and perhaps the conflict and confusion arise from the desire to fit into this self-projected pattern. You are struggling to be something which you are not. Is that it?</p><p id="88f3897f-5608-4362-aeac-f43cf1dda1dd" class="">‘I am beginning to see where I am confused. I think what you say is true.’</p><p id="17280734-577a-442f-8840-2fad6f58c312" class="">The conflict is between the actual and the myth, between that which you are and that which you would like to be. The pattern of the myth has been cultivated from childhood and has progressively widened and deepened, growing in contrast to the actual, and being constantly modified by circumstances. This myth, like all ideals, goals, Utopias, is in contradiction to what is the implicit, the actual; so the myth is an escape from that which you are. This escape inevitably creates the barren conflict of the opposites; and all conflict, inward or outward, is vain, futile, stupid, creating confusion and antagonism.</p><p id="16ff7ea7-7520-41b8-9c22-07357c0c4f51" class="">So, if I may say so, your confusion arises from the conflict between what you are and the myth of what you should be. The myth, the ideal, is unreal; it is a self-projected escape, it has no actuality. The actual is what you are. What you are is much more important than what you should be. You can understand what is, but you cannot understand what should be. There is no understanding of an illusion, there is only understanding of the way it comes into being. The myth, the fictitious, the ideal, has no validity; it is a result, an end, and what is important is to understand the process through which it has come into being.</p><p id="96ec9d43-dcb8-475e-988c-adb864efb7fc" class="">To understand that which you are, whether pleasant or unpleasant, the myth, the ideal, the self-projected future state, must entirely cease. Then only can you tackle what is. To understand what is, there must be freedom from all distraction. Distraction is the condemnation or justification of what is. Distraction is comparison; it is resistance or discipline against the actual. Distraction is the very effort or compulsion to understand. All distractions are a hindrance to the swift pursuit of what is. What is is not static; it is in constant movement, and to follow it the mind must not be tethered to any belief, to any hope of success or fear of failure. Only in passive yet alert awareness can that which is unfold. This unfoldment is not of time.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="189be530-0255-40fb-83e6-019cfade9e9a" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Becoming Implies Time and Problems</summary><p id="e90f6556-c722-49e4-86d6-ace1880a246d" class="">In an analysis of the complexities of human nature and consciousness, the focus centers on a pivotal question: Has humanity strayed from its intended evolutionary path? This inquiry posits that a significant deviation occurred thousands of years ago when societies shifted from constructive, communal activities to pursuits centered around exploitation and conquest. This shift marked a transition from a focus on external development to an internal preoccupation with self-betterment, laying the foundation for perpetual internal and external conflict.</p><p id="863ac006-c6e6-4309-9300-2d6f08eb1614" class="">The root of human conflict is explored in depth, with the suggestion that it stems from the inherent structure of thought. Human thought, characterized by a continual striving to improve, both materially and spiritually, inherently creates a dichotomy. This dichotomy exists in the constant struggle between &#x27;what is&#x27; – the current state of being – and &#x27;what should be&#x27; – an idealized future state. This struggle is seen as a primary source of human suffering.</p><p id="b13bf1f0-9eeb-486a-9f86-e34456bd4974" class="">Central to this analysis is the concept of time, particularly psychological time, and its role in human distress. Psychological time, characterized by the endless pursuit of change, achievement, and becoming, is identified as a key contributor to human sorrow. While time is essential for practical tasks and learning, its misuse in the psychological realm perpetuates conflict and unhappiness.</p><p id="c2c1bd69-6f7c-44eb-aff0-6207f0bb673b" class="">The notion of psychological evolution is challenged, suggesting that while physical evolution is a verifiable phenomenon, the concept of the mind evolving over time is debatable. The misinterpretation of psychological time, viewed as the progression of the self or ego through time, is pinpointed as the root of human misery. It is proposed that the cessation of psychological time could lead to the end of this perpetual conflict.</p><p id="27dc216d-575b-452d-a113-af410aef9fb4" class="">Further exploration delves into the nature of the self or ego. The ego, or the sense of &#x27;I&#x27;, is identified as the source of conflict, emerging from humans&#x27; need for identity and belonging. This need for identity extends from external affiliations to an internal sense of self. However, this internal movement mirrors the external, creating a cycle of conflict.</p><p id="7c49e0e7-1989-4499-876d-67b1cde9a5c6" class="">The discussion also speculates on the human brain&#x27;s evolution and its potential unconditioned aspects.

In the absence of psychological time and the ego, a state of &#x27;nothing&#x27; is proposed, which paradoxically contains &#x27;everything&#x27;, implying an infinite source of energy. This state of nothingness is not a void but a state of potentiality and the essence of all existence. The realization of this state could signify the beginning of a new form of existence, a new creation beyond the constraints of time and conflict.</p><p id="70b41a21-94b3-44bc-b86a-e8ffb584b0e1" class="">This analysis presents a deep inquiry into human existence and psychology, suggesting that a significant shift in perspective could lead to resolving the deep-seated conflicts that afflict humanity.

The conflict between the opposites is considered necessary, essential. This conflict is what is trying to become what it is not; and what it is not is the ideal, the self-projection. You are struggling to become something, and that something is part of yourself. The ideal is your own projection. See how the mind has played a trick upon itself.

You are violent, and you are struggling to become non-violent, the ideal; but the ideal is a projection of what is, only under a different name.

I wonder why we divide life into fragments, the business life, social life, family life, religious life, the life of sport and so on? Why is there this division, not only in ourselves but also socially – we and they, you and me, love and hate, dying and living? I think we ought to go into this question rather deeply to find out if there is a way of life in which there is no division at all between living and dying, between the conscious and the unconscious, the business and social life, the family life and the individual life. These divisions between nationalities, religions, classes, all this separation in oneself in which there is so much contradiction – why do we live that way? It breeds such turmoil, conflict, war; it brings about real insecurity, outwardly as well as inwardly. There is so much division, as God and the devil, the good and the bad, ‘what should be’ and ‘what is.’ I think it would be worthwhile to spend this evening in trying to find out if there is a way of living – not theoretically or intellectually but actually – a way of life, in which there is no division whatsoever; a way of life in which action is not fragmented, so that it is one constant flow, where every action is related to all other actions. To find a way of living in which there is no fragmentation one has to go very deeply into the question of love and death; in understanding that we may be able to come upon a way of life that is a continuous movement, not broken up, a way of life that is highly intelligent. A fragmented mind lacks intelligence; the man who leads half a dozen lives – which is accepted as being highly moral – obviously shows lack of intelligence. It seems to me that the idea of integration – of putting together the various fragments to make a whole – is obviously not intelligent, for it implies that there is an integrator, one who is integrating, putting together, all the fragments; but the very entity that tries to do this is also part of that fragment. What is needed is such intelligence and passion as to bring about a radical revolution in one’s life, so that there is no contradictory action but whole, continuous movement. To bring about this change in one’s life there must be passion. If one is to do anything worthwhile, one must have this intense passion – which is not pleasure. To understand that action in which there is no fragmentation or contradiction, there must be this passion. Intellectual concepts and formulas will not change one’s way of life, but only the very understanding of ‘what is; and for that there must be an intensity, a passion. To find out if there is a way of living – daily living, not a monastic living – which has this quality of passion and intelligence one has to understand the nature of pleasure. We went into the question of pleasure the other day, of how thought sustains an experience, which has given for the moment a delight, and how by thinking about it, pleasure is sustained; where there is pleasure there is bound to be pain and fear. Is love pleasure? For most of us moral values are based on pleasure; the very sacrificing of oneself, controlling oneself in order to conform, is the urge of pleasure – greater, nobler, or whatever it is. Is love a thing of pleasure? Again that word ‘love’ is so loaded, everyone uses it, from the politician to the husband and wife. And it seems to me that it is only love, in the deepest sense of the word, that can bring about a way of life in which there is no fragmentation at all. Fear is always part of pleasure; obviously where there is any kind of fear in relationship there must be fragmentation, there must be division. It is really quite a deep issue, this inquiry as to why the human mind has always divided itself in opposition to others, resulting in violence and what it is hoped to achieve through violence. We human beings are committed to a way of life that leads to war and yet at the same time we want peace, we want freedom; but it is peace only as an idea, as an ideology; and at the same time everything that we do conditions us. There is the division, psychologically, of time; time as the past (the yesterday), today and tomorrow; we must inquire into this if we are to find a way of life in which division does not exist at all. We have to consider if it is time, as the past, the present and the future – psychological time – that is the cause of this division. Is division brought about by the known, as memory, which is the past, which is the content of the brain itself? Or does division arise because the ‘observer,’ the ‘experiencer,’ the ‘thinker’ is always separate from the thing which he observes, experiences? Or is it the egotistic self-centred activity, which is the ‘me’ and the ‘you,’ creating its own resistances, its own isolated activities, which causes this division? In going into this, one must be aware of all these issues: time; the “observer” separating himself from the thing observed; the experiencer different from the experience; pleasure; and whether all this has anything whatsoever to do with love. Is there tomorrow psychologically? – actually, not invented by thought. There is a tomorrow in chronological time; but is there actually tomorrow, psychologically, inwardly? If there is tomorrow as idea, then action is not complete, and that action brings about division, contradiction. The idea of tomorrow, the future is – is it not? – the cause of not seeing things very clearly as they are now – ‘I hope to see them more clearly tomorrow’. One is lazy; one does not have this passion, this vital interest, to find out. Thought invents the idea of eventually arriving, eventually understanding; so for that, time is necessary, many days are necessary. Does time bring understanding, does it enable one to see something very clearly? Is it possible for the mind to be free of the past so that it is not bound by time? Tomorrow, psychologically, is in terms of the known; is there then the possibility of being free from the known? Is there the possibility of an action not in terms of the known? One of the most difficult things is to communicate. There must be verbal communication, obviously, but I think there is a much deeper level of communication, which is not only a verbal communication but communion, where both of us meet at the same level, with the same intensity, with the same passion; then only does communion take place, something far more important than mere verbal communication. And as we are talking about something rather complex, which touches very deeply our daily life, there must not only be verbal communication but also communion. What we are concerned about is a radical revolution, psychologically; not in some distant future, but actually today, now. We are concerned to find out whether the human mind, which has been so conditioned, can change immediately, so that its actions are a continuous whole, not broken up, and therefore pitted with its regrets, despairs, pains, fears, anxieties, its guilt and so on. How can the mind throw it all off and be completely fresh, young and innocent? That is really the issue. I do not think this is possible – such a radical revolution – so long as there is a division between the ‘observer’ and the observed, between the ‘experiencer’ and the experienced. It is this division that brings about conflict. All division must bring about conflict, and through conflict, through struggle, through battle, obviously there can be no change, in the deep psychological sense – though there may be superficial changes. So how is the mind, the heart and the brain, the total state, to cope with this problem of division? We said we would go into this question of the conscious and the deeper levels, the unconscious: and we are asking why is there this division, this division between the conscious mind, occupied with its own daily activities, worries, problems, superficial pleasures, earning a livelihood and so on and the deeper levels of that mind, with all its hidden motives, its drives, compulsive demands, its fears? Why is there this division? Does it exist because we are so occupied, superficially, with endless chatter, with the constant demand, superficially, for amusement, entertainment, religious as well as otherwise? Because the superficial mind cannot possibly delve go deeply into itself while this division arises. What is the content of the deeper layers of the mind? – not according to the psychologists, Freud and so on – and how do you find out, if you do not read what others have said? How will you find out what your unconscious is? You will watch it, will you not? Or, will you expect your dreams to interpret the contents of the unconscious? And who is to translate those dreams? The experts? – they are also conditioned by their specialization. And one asks: is it possible not to dream at all? – excepting of course for nightmares when one has eaten the wrong food, or has had too heavy a meal in the evening. There is – we will use the word for the time being – the unconscious. What is it made of? – obviously the past; all the racial consciousness, the racial residue, the family tradition, the various religious and social conditioning – hidden, dark, undiscovered; can all that be discovered and exposed without dreams? – or without going to an analyst? – so that the mind, when it does sleep, is quiet, not incessantly active. And, because it is quiet, may there not come into it quite a different quality, a different activity altogether, dissociated from the daily anxieties, fears, worries, problems, demands? To find that out – if that is possible – that is, not to dream at all, so that the mind is really fresh when it wakes up in the morning, one has to be aware during the day, aware of the hints and intimations. Those one can discover only in relationship; when you are watching your relationship with others, without condemning, judging, evaluating; just watching how you behave, your reactions; seeing without any choice; just observing, so that during the day the hidden, the unconscious, is exposed. Why do we give such deep significance and meaning to the unconscious? – for after all, it is as trivial as the conscious. If the conscious mind is extraordinarily active, watching, listening, seeing, then the conscious mind becomes far more important than the unconscious; in that state all the contents of the unconscious are exposed; the division between the various layers comes to an end. Watching your reactions when you sit in a bus, when you are talking to your wife, your husband, when in your office, writing, being alone – if you are ever alone – then this whole process of observation, this act of seeing (in which there is no division as the ‘observer’ and the ‘observed’) ends the contradiction. When this is somewhat clear, then we can ask: What is love? Is love pleasure? Is love jealousy? Is love possessive? Does love dominate? – the husband over the wife and the wife over the husband. Surely, not one of these things is love; yet we are burdened with all these things, and yet we say to our husband or our wife, or whoever it is, ‘I love you.’ Now, most of us are, in some form or other, envious. Envy arises through comparison, through measurement, through wanting to be something different from what one is. Can we see envy as it actually is, and be entirely free of it, for it never to happen again? – otherwise love cannot exist. Love is not of time; love cannot be cultivated; it is not a thing of pleasure. What is death? What is the relationship between love and death? I think we will find the relationship between the two when we understand the meaning of ‘death; to understand that we must obviously understand what living is. What actually is our living? – the daily living, not the ideological, the intellectual something, which we consider should be, but which is really false. What actually is our living? – the daily living of conflict, despair, loneliness, isolation. Our life is a battlefield, sleeping and waking; we try to escape from this in various ways through music, art, museums, religious or philosophical entertainment, spinning a lot of theories, caught up in knowledge, anything but putting an end to this conflict, to this battle which we call living, with its constant sorrow. Can the sorrow in daily life end? Unless the mind changes radically our living has very little meaning – going to the office every day, earning a livelihood, reading a few books, being able to quote cleverly, being very well-informed – a life which is empty, a real bourgeois life. And then as one becomes aware of this state of affairs, one begins to invent a meaning to life; find some significance to give to it; one searches out the clever people who will give one the significance, the purpose, of life – which is another escape from living. This kind of living must undergo a radical transformation. Why is it we are frightened of death? – as most people are. Frightened of what? Do please observe your own fears of what we call death – being frightened of coming to the end of this battle which we call living. We are frightened of the unknown, what might happen; we are frightened of leaving the known things, the family, the books, the attachment to your house and furniture, to the people near us. We are frightened to let go of the things known; and the known is his living in sorrow, pain and despair, with occasional flashes of joy; there is no end to this constant struggle; that is what we call living – of that we are frightened to let go. Is it the ‘me’ – who is the result of all this accumulation – that is frightened that it will come to an end? – therefore it demands a future hope, therefore there must be reincarnation. The idea of reincarnation, in which the whole of the East believes, is that you will be born next life a little higher up on the rungs of the ladder. You have been a dishwasher this life, next life you will be a prince, or whatever it is – somebody else will go and wash the dishes for you. For those who believe in reincarnation, what you are in this life matters very much, because what you do, how you behave, what your thoughts are, what your activities are, so in the next life depending on this, you either get a reward or you are punished. But they do not care a pin about how they behave; for them it is just another form of belief, just as the belief that there is heaven, God, what you will. Actually all that matters is what you are now, today, how you actually behave, not only outwardly but inwardly. The West has its own form of consolation about death, it rationalizes it, it has its own religious conditioning. So, what is death, actually – the ending? The organism is going to end, because it grows old, or from disease and accident. Very few of us grow old beautifully because we are tortured entities, our faces show it as we grow older – and there is the sadness of old age, remembering the things of the past. Can one die to everything that is ‘known,’ psychologically, from day to day? Unless there is freedom from that known, what is ‘possible’ can never be captured. As it is, our ‘possibility’ is always within the field of the ‘known; but when there is freedom, then that ‘possibility’ is immense. Can one die, psychologically, to all one’s past, to all the attachments, fears, to the anxiety, vanity, and pride, so completely that tomorrow you wake up a fresh human being? You will say, ‘How is this to be done, what is the method?’ There is no method, because ‘a method’ implies tomorrow; it implies that you will practice and achieve something eventually, tomorrow, after many tomorrows. But can you see immediately the truth of it – see it actually, not theoretically – that the mind cannot be fresh, innocent, young, vital, passionate, unless there is an ending, psychologically, to everything of the past? But we do not want to let the past go because we are the past; all our thoughts are based on the past; all knowledge is the past; so the mind cannot let go; any effort it makes to let go is still part of the past, the past hoping to achieve a different state. The mind must become extraordinarily quiet, silent; and it does become extraordinarily quiet without any resistance, without any system, when it sees this whole issue. Man has always sought immortality; he paints a picture, puts his name on it, that is a form of immortality; leaving a name behind, man always wants to leave something of himself behind. What has he got to give – apart from technological knowledge – what has he of himself to give? What is he? You and I, what are we, psychologically? You may have a bigger bank account, be cleverer than I am, or this and that; but psychologically, what are we? – a lot of words, memories, experiences, and these we want to hand over to a son, put in a book, or paint in a picture, ‘me.’ The ‘me’ becomes extremely important, the ‘me’ opposed to the community, the ‘me, wanting to identity itself, wanting to fulfil itself, wanting to become something great – you know, all the rest of it. When you observe that ‘me,’ you see that it is a bundle of memories, empty words: that is what we cling to; that is the very essence of the separation between you and me, they and we. When you understand all this – observe it, not through another but through yourself, watch it very closely, without any judgment, evaluation, suppression, just to observe – then you will see that love is only possible when there is death. Love is not memory; love is not pleasure. It is said that love is related to sex – back again to the division between profane love and sacred love, with approval of one and condemnation of the other. Surely, love is none of these things. One cannot come upon it, totally, completely, unless there is a dying to the past, a dying to all the travail, conflict and sorrow; then there is love; then one can do what one will. As we said the other day, it is fairly easy to ask a question; but ask it purposefully and keep with it until you have resolved it totally for yourself; such asking has an importance; but to ask casually has very little meaning. Question: If you do not have the division between the ‘what is’ and the ‘what should be’ you might become complacent, you would not worry about the terrible things that are going on. Krishnamurti: What is the reality of ‘what should be’? Has it any reality at all? Man is violent but the ‘should be’ peaceful. What is the reality of the ‘should be,’ and why do we have the ‘should be’? If this division were to cease, would man become complacent, accept everything? Would I accept violence if I had no ideal of non-violence? Non-violence has been preached from the most ancient days: don’t kill, be compassionate, and so on; and the fact is, man is violent, that is ‘what is.’ If man accepts it as inevitable, then he becomes complacent – as he is now. He has accepted war as a way of life and he goes on, though a thousand sanctions, religious, social, and otherwise, say, ‘Do not kill’ – not only man, but animals; but he does kill animals for food, and he does go to war. So if there was no ideal at all you would be left with ‘what is’ Would that make one complacent? Or would you then have the energy, the interest, the vitality, to solve ‘what is’? Is not the ideal of non-violence an escape from the fact of violence? When the mind is not escaping, but is confronted with the fact of violence – that it is violent, not condemning it, not judging it – then surely, such a mind has an entirely different quality and there is no longer violence. Such a mind does not accept violence; violence is not merely hurting or killing somebody; violence is equally this distortion, in conforming, imitating, following the social morality, or following one’s own peculiar morality. Every form of control and suppression is a form of distortion and therefore violence. Surely, to understand ‘what is,’ there must be a tension, a watchfulness to find out what actually is. What actually is, is the division man has created by nationalism, which is one of the major causes of war; we accept it, we worship the flag; and there are the divisions created by religion, we are Christians, Buddhists, this or that. Can we not be free of the ‘what is’ by observing the actual fact? You can only be free of it when the mind does not distort what is observed.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="622f0b60-22f9-4f4f-b75e-6bb58f9bd342" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Division, Observer, The Observed</summary><p id="a1c3e2b0-27f1-4b43-a3cd-9d446e985109" class="">In the exploration of human consciousness and perception, a fundamental question arises: Why does a sense of division or separation exist between oneself and the rest of existence, including people, objects, and nature itself? This inquiry delves into the depths of how we perceive the world and ourselves, challenging the very structure of thought that underpins our everyday experiences.</p><h3 id="4fecd302-dc96-40e4-a48d-e147068b70af" class="">The Roots of Division</h3><p id="35537377-d411-4da0-b6bf-d82b5d012376" class="">At the heart of human experience lies the observer – the entity we identify as the &#x27;self,&#x27; distinct and separate from the external world. This observer navigates through life, making distinctions between the self and others, between desirable and undesirable, between what is known and unknown. This separation is not merely a philosophical concept but a lived reality that influences our relationships, our sense of identity, and our understanding of the world.</p><h3 id="35fa9f75-2519-4b6e-ab48-98780efe8268" class="">The Observer and Thought</h3><p id="4ede3f1e-5a48-4ea2-a03a-ce2d9810418a" class="">The observer is a product of thought, a construct of accumulated memories, experiences, and conditioning from the past. Thought, in its essence, is matter – a tangible process stored in the brain, measurable and rooted in time. This temporal foundation of thought creates a perpetual division between the past, present, and future, fragmenting our experience of life into disparate moments and events. The observer, then, is the embodiment of this fragmentation, perpetually separating itself from the observed, whether it be an object, a person, or an experience.</p><h3 id="9c5b0d9a-164b-43a0-9c99-5dafa31397a9" class="">The Cycle of Conflict</h3><p id="345a5601-82e7-4ed5-8eff-df9ee420d019" class="">This division between the observer and the observed is the source of conflict and disharmony. When the observer perceives itself as separate from the rest of existence, it engages in a continuous struggle to bridge this gap, seeking unity, connection, or understanding. However, the very nature of the observer, rooted in division and difference, perpetuates the cycle of conflict. The attempt to overcome separation through thought only reinforces the division, as thought itself is the mechanism of separation.</p><h3 id="71b56d6b-a8e7-4707-9ec7-a470324f0795" class="">Dissolving the Division</h3><p id="5f690482-0fc6-42a7-b901-f4523fcabcac" class="">The key to transcending this fundamental division lies in understanding the true nature of the observer and the observed. The realization that the observer is not separate from the observed – that they are two aspects of a single, indivisible process of experiencing – dissolves the illusion of separation. This insight reveals that the division is a construct of thought, a product of our conditioning and our attachment to identity, form, and time.</p><h3 id="d72e0537-bf17-4bd2-8265-07533ba6317d" class="">Beyond Thought: The Realm of Love</h3><p id="e402910d-6bd6-4e18-8db0-fc660353d2c9" class="">When the division between the observer and the observed collapses, what remains is a state of pure awareness, unmediated by thought, where the duality of subject and object no longer exists. This state, beyond the confines of thought and time, is where true love resides – a love that is not the action of the observer, but an all-encompassing embrace of existence without separation or division. It is in this realization that one finds the essence of meditation and the path to a profound connection with the totality of life.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="b65e4298-c933-4503-985e-78587e1c66ed" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Emotions and the Body</summary><p id="371e6d47-36bd-4b61-a466-36754254f728" class="">Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental-emotional reactive patterns. Emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet. It is the body&#x27;s reaction to your mind - or you might say, a reflection of your mind in the body. For example, an attack thought or a hostile thought will create a build-up of energy in the body that we call anger. The body is getting ready to fight. The thought that you are being threatened, physically or psychologically, causes the body to contract, and this is the physical side of what we call fear. Research has shown that strong emotions even cause changes in the biochemistry of the body. These biochemical changes represent the physical or material aspect of the emotion. Of course, you are not usually conscious of all your thought patterns, and it is often only through watching your emotions that you can bring them into awareness.</p><p id="cd4bcf04-9119-4b2f-a054-6f864342ffee" class="">The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes and dislikes,judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you are as the watching consciousness, the stronger the emotional energy charge will be, whether you are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your emotions, if you are cut off from them, you will eventually experience them on a purely physical level, as a physical problem or symptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent years, so we don&#x27;t need to go into it here. A strong unconscious emotional pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to just happen to you. For example, I have observed that people who carry a lot of anger inside without being aware of it and without expressing it are more likely to be attacked, verbally or even physically, by other angry people, and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong emanation of anger that certain people pick up subliminally and that triggers their own latent anger.</p><p id="32040ceb-a240-4ea2-a406-899436a8c844" class="">If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, start by focusing attention on the inner energy field of your body. Feel the body from within. This will also put you in touch with your emotions. We will explore this in more detail later.</p><p id="490e3903-aefb-4e21-b7e6-0b34524a67c4" class="">You say that an emotion is the mind&#x27;s reflection in the body. But sometimes there is a conflict between the two: the mind says &quot;no&quot; while the emotion says &quot;yes,&quot; or the other way around.</p><p id="b7ac49cd-cf55-4ddc-9331-bbbb45b8ef36" class="">If you really want to know your mind, the body will always give you a truthful reflection, so look at the emotion or rather feel it in your body. If there is an apparent conflict between them, the thought will be the lie, the emotion will be the truth. Not the ultimate truth of who you are, but the relative truth of your state of mind at that time.</p><p id="9034e2dc-c1a6-4fb4-97dc-91a178702192" class="">Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental processes is certainly common. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity into awareness as thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as an emotion, and of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and so is primarily felt in the body. You can then allow the emotion to be there without being controlled by it. You no longer are the emotion; you are the watcher, the observing presence. If you practice this, all that is unconscious in you will be brought into the light of consciousness.</p><p id="09e7c8a8-5521-4be6-81da-7fbda36a5158" class=""><strong>So observing our emotions is as important as observing our thoughts?</strong></p><p id="5dc57831-5c0c-44d8-a45f-2e02bea40ba8" class="">Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself: What&#x27;s going on inside me at this moment? That question will point you in the right direction. But don&#x27;t analyze, just watch. Focus your attention within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no emotion present, take your attention more deeply into the inner energy field of your body. It is the doorway into Being.</p><p id="81ea88d1-bd91-4238-ab91-b2029f2e1753" class="">An emotion usually represents an amplified and energized thought pattern, and because of its often overpowering energetic charge, it is not easy initially to stay present enough to be able to watch it. It wants to take you over, and it usually succeeds - unless there is enough presence in you. If you are pulled into unconscious identification with the emotion through lack of presence, which is normal, the emotion temporarily becomes &quot;you.&quot; Often a vicious circle builds up between your thinking and the emotion: they feed each other. The thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the form of an emotion, and the vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern.</p><p id="dc1fafb9-d35a-4312-a9ae-f3c6882f235d" class="">By dwelling mentally on the situation, event, or person that is the perceived cause of the emotion, the thought feeds energy to the emotion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on.</p><p id="c240fb3e-63e8-48a5-b87d-439d4cacd137" class="">Basically, all emotions are modifications of one primordial, undifferentiated emotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are beyond name and form. Because of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name that precisely describes this emotion. &quot;Fear&quot; comes close, but apart from a continuous sense of threat, it also includes a deep sense of abandonment and incompleteness. It may be best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as that basic emotion and simply call it &quot;pain.&quot; One of the main tasks of the mind is to fight or remove that emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain. The mind can never find the solution, nor can it afford to allow you to find the solution, because it is itself an intrinsic part of the &quot;problem.&quot; Imagine a chief of police trying to find an arsonist when the arsonist is the chief of police. You will not be free of that pain until you cease to derive your sense of self from identification with the mind, which is to say from ego. The mind is then toppled from its place of power and Being reveals itself as your true nature.</p><p id="b20cafd3-2d11-4c36-a0ce-5043c28122f2" class=""><strong>What about positive emotions such as love and joy?</strong></p><p id="73770a44-af4b-4025-9b8e-29bc309c7fce" class="">They are inseparable from your natural state of inner connectedness with Being. Glimpses of love and joy or brief moments of deep peace are possible whenever a gap occurs in the stream of thought. For most people, such gaps happen rarely and only accidentally, in moments when the mind is rendered &quot;speechless,&quot; sometimes triggered by great beauty, extreme physical exertion, or even great danger. Suddenly, there is inner stillness. And within that stillness there is a subtle but intense joy, there is love, there is peace.</p><p id="e0355d9b-7f52-4c06-91b8-39cd1dd5be54" class="">Usually, such moments are short-lived, as the mind quickly resumes its noise- making activity that we call thinking. Love, joy, and peace cannot flourish until you have freed yourself from mind dominance. But they are not what I would call emotions. They lie beyond the emotions, on a much deeper level. So you need to become fully conscious of your emotions and be able to feel them before you can feel that which lies beyond them. Emotion literally means &quot;disturbance.&quot; The word comes from the Latin <em>emovere</em>, meaning &quot;to disturb.&quot;</p><p id="4e4279fb-ff9b-4fe4-b2bc-64def9550ce6" class="">Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being or rather three aspects of the state of inner connectedness with Being. As such, they have no opposite. This is because they arise from beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being part of the dualistic mind, are subject to the law of opposites. This simply means that you cannot have good without bad. So in the unenlightened, mind-identified condition, what is sometimes wrongly called joy is the usually short-lived pleasure side of the continuously alternating pain/pleasure cycle. Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn into its opposite at the flick of a switch. Many &quot;love&quot; relationships, after the initial euphoria has passed, actually oscillate between &quot;love&quot; and hate, attraction and attack.</p><p id="15af5926-bec5-4e1c-b9b3-7f4d7657e5dd" class="">Real love doesn&#x27;t make you suffer. How could it? It doesn&#x27;t suddenly turn into hate, nor does real joy turn into pain. As I said, even before you are enlightened - before you have freed yourself from your mind - you may get glimpses of true joy, true love, or of a deep inner peace, still but vibrantly alive. These are aspects of your true nature, which is usually obscured by the mind. Even within a &quot;normal&quot; addictive relationship, there can be moments when the presence of something more genuine, something incorruptible, can be felt. But they will only be glimpses, soon to be covered up again through mind interference. It may then seem that you had something very precious and lost it, or your mind may convince you that it was all an illusion anyway. The truth is that it wasn&#x27;t an illusion, and you cannot lose it. It is part of your natural state, which can be obscured but can never be destroyed by the mind. Even when the sky is heavily overcast, the sun hasn&#x27;t disappeared. It&#x27;s still there on the other side of the clouds.</p><p id="4160ffa5-a731-48c1-ad37-245f136db24b" class="">The Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desire or craving and that to be free of pain we need to cut the bonds of desire.</p><p id="8d0911fd-60b9-411c-9c39-3414b6da84dc" class="">All cravings are the mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in external things and in the future as a substitute for the joy of Being. As long as I am my mind, I am those cravings, those needs, wants, attachments, and aversions, and apart from them there is no &quot;I&quot; except as a mere possibility, an unfulfilled potential, a seed that has not yet sprouted. In that state, even my desire to become free or enlightened is just another craving for fulfillment or completion in the future. So don&#x27;t seek to become free of desire or &quot;achieve&quot; enlightenment. Become present. Be there as the observer of the mind. Instead of quoting the Buddha, be the Buddha, be &quot;the awakened one,&quot; which is what the word buddha means.</p><p id="e11ce5c5-2092-453f-ac5f-88d7b4d97f79" class="">Humans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since they fell from the state of grace, entered the realm of time and mind, and lost awareness of Being. At that point, they started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments in an alien universe, unconnected to the Source and to each other.</p><p id="f33f9526-4501-4cfd-a6d6-edc9aabef390" class="">Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is to say as long as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. I am talking here primarily of emotional pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease. Resentment, hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest irritation, are all forms of pain. And every pleasure or emotional high contains within itself the seed of pain: its inseparable opposite, which will manifest in time.</p><p id="7fc45f0a-3490-4d2f-9eef-df1c24b77e5d" class="">Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get &quot;high&quot; will know that the high eventually turns into a low, that the pleasure turns into some form of pain. Many people also know from their own experience how easily and quickly an intimate relationship can turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain. Seen from a higher perspective, both the negative and the positive polarities are faces of the same coin, are both part of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the mind- identified egoic state of consciousness.</p><p id="bab3ab2a-a917-49fe-b48d-eb48e2a46055" class="">There are two levels to your pain: the pain that you create now, and the pain from the past that still lives on in your mind and body. Ceasing to create pain in the present and dissolving past pain - this is what I want to talk about now.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="93d02b9b-e378-4952-ab36-7e7ceb521b5b" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Awakened Doing</summary><p id="5c47b367-dcd0-4aa5-b4bd-f15314a93167" class="">The awakening process has two aspects, or two dimensions, to it. One is the finding the Source within, as yourself. Then, [there is] bringing that into your life more and more – so that your daily life becomes interspersed with that Stillness.</p><p id="9ba54b7e-6c97-4f88-a449-de3f878cb35e" class="">As your life becomes interspersed with that Stillness, the ego then begins to fade. You embody a different energy field – as if something from another dimension were coming through you into this world.</p><p id="d254bfc0-587a-4539-9ef3-2393b65f8b2c" class="">The most essential thing is the foundation for all subsequent “awakened doing”, as I sometimes call it. The world is full of people who are doing, but it’s mostly unawakened doing. This comes out of unhappy states, and creates more unhappy states. Our first task is to bring that dimension, the other dimension, into this world. With your normal everyday life, see if Presence can flow into the smallest things – listening to another person, walking from here to there, and so on. Presence implies acceptance of whatever is, in the Now, in alignment with the form of the Now, as a spiritual practice. The more you are aligned with the form of the Now, the more this energy comes through.</p><p id="4b787434-41d4-4b2e-a536-b6515108b005" class="">It’s vital for us to be grounded in the Presence of everyday life. The foundation is continuous acceptance of the is-ness of Now. Through that, Presence arises more and more. You work with the present moment, as your teacher so-to-speak. Bring a “yes” to it. With that, the Presence comes. You have to first come to an acceptance of the is-ness of things – not the world situation – just your limited reality. After a little while you will notice that there is another aspect to Presence. It’s not just still – there’s also a dynamic aspect to Presence. That’s where “awakened doing” comes in.</p><p id="509abd6d-bbe7-4958-ad8b-147336e048b7" class="">First it changes the way in which you deal with others. One day, something else wants to be done that needs doing. You might perceive it as something that you need to do. Suddenly you know what it is that you need to do. It comes from within, or it comes from without – some situation in your life. Then, “awakened doing” begins to happen. That doing is not the egoic doing, where whatever you do is a means to an end. There is deep enjoyment in the doing. There is not an excessive desire to achieve, but you achieve actually more – because there’s so much enjoyment in the doing that the end result looks after itself. A very different kind of doing arises, that is not motivated by desire. The normal way is thinking “I need to achieve this”.</p><p id="428c236d-a9d3-46e8-846b-ac2cc5db5d8f" class="">As Presence moves through you, it’s not based on desire anymore, it’s based on enjoyment. It’s not based on wanting or needing anything, because you’re coming from fullness. The action is not designed to fulfill you. It’s not designed to add something to you. The action is coming out of the fullness in which you already dwell – so there’s no neediness in it.</p><p id="597d6317-aad1-4595-ba6a-b786ec3bbed8" class="">Obstacles arise, as they will, especially if you do things that go against the conditioning of the world – you may find obstacles. You also may find enormous power helping you.</p><p id="bb116526-a576-41d5-be67-0d8a856ddbb6" class="">Obstacles may come in the form of uncooperative people, or situations, but enormous power will also flow into what you do and help you in many ways. Just the right thing, just at the right moment, just the right person. When obstacles do arise, they are not regarded as enemies. The ego regards any obstacle to its course of action as an enemy.</p><p id="46128485-bc05-45ce-8e24-042a03ef4313" class="">An obstacle is accepted for what it is, and you work with it – not against it. Or you work around it, or you take its energy and turn it around. It becomes incorporated into what you have to do. You don’t see any more enemies in the form of unhelpful situations, uncooperative people. Everything is embraced for what it is, accepted for what it is, and transformed. It’s not so much that you are doing it, you become a vehicle for the doing. It happens through you. The power comes when it wants to come.</p><p id="a5821338-8d35-4887-a322-59951c92a638" class="">I don’t have the sense that I am “doing” any of this. I just go with it. Am I speaking as a person? No, its Consciousness speaking, using this mind, to express what is most helpful for this moment. So be in the service of that. You are in the service of that. Get rid of the idea that you have to “do” anything as a separate entity. Be open to what it is that wants to be done in this world, then conscious doing happens through you. Every so-called “individual” has a different function in this world. The more you get out of the way, you do it by bringing Presence into everyday life, then the answer of what it is that wants to be done comes through you.</p><p id="c136068f-dd7e-41f0-ba63-951f7d53836e" class="">It’s a wonderful adventure to be aligned with that. There is a lot that wants to come through at this time. It doesn’t choose between people, it doesn’t say “You are special, I’m going to choose you”. Whenever a person becomes transparent to it, it comes through. It doesn’t ask “Who are you, what are your credentials?” It doesn’t ask, “What is your personal history? Are you worthy?” It’s timeless Presence. It’s not interested in your past history, whether you were the most virtuous person. Wherever the opening is, the light comes through.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="e6307fbe-e03e-4388-bd6c-620fdfe7ee39" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Action and Idea</summary><p id="4be90399-8e9c-464b-b3d1-7f06a5d67477" class="">I WOULD LIKE to discuss the problem of action. This may be rather abstruse and difficult at the beginning but I hope that by thinking it over we shall be able to see the issue clearly, because our whole existence, our whole life, is a process of action.</p><p id="2da033e1-f566-46fc-a874-66244e7ea6e5" class="">Most of us live in a series of actions, of seemingly unrelated, disjointed actions, leading to disintegration, to frustration. It is a problem that concerns each one of us, because we live by action and without action there is no life, there is no experience, there is no thinking. Thought is action; and merely to pursue action at one particular level of consciousness, which is the outer, merely to be caught up in outward action without understanding the whole process of action itself, will inevitably lead us to frustration, to misery.</p><p id="f6c45354-0265-4063-a808-ed79ed993523" class="">Our life is a series of actions or a process of action at different levels of consciousness. Consciousness is experiencing, naming and recording. That is consciousness is challenge and response, which is experiencing, then terming or naming, and then recording, which is memory. This process is action, is it not? Consciousness is action; and without challenge, response, without experiencing, naming or terming, without recording, which is memory, there is no action.</p><p id="6e600b7a-a81b-4e28-afab-d0b611beff3c" class="">Now action creates the actor. That is the actor comes into being when action has a result, an end in view. If there is no result in action, then there is no actor; but if there is an end or a result in view, then action brings about the actor.</p><p id="10d3b2c2-9fe1-4dea-8c07-3fe1249d72e4" class="">Thus actor, action, and end or result, is a unitary process, a single process, which comes into being when action has an end in view. Action towards a result is will; otherwise there is no will, is there? The desire to achieve an end brings about will, which is the actor – I want to achieve, I want to write a book, I want to be a rich man, I want to paint a picture.</p><p id="2098427b-bece-4fac-81c6-d2c9b8c729bd" class="">We are familiar with these three states: the actor, the action, and the end. That is our daily existence. I am just explaining what is; but we will begin to understand how to transform what is only when we examine it clearly, so that there is no illusion or prejudice, no bias with regard to it. Now these three states which constitute experience – the actor, the action, and the result – are surely a process of becoming. Otherwise there is no becoming, is there? If there is no actor, and if there is no action towards an end, there is no becoming; but life as we know it, our daily life, is a process of becoming. I am poor and I act with an end in view, which is to become rich. I am ugly and I want to become beautiful. Therefore my life is a process of becoming something. The will to be is the will to become, at different levels of consciousness, in different states, in which there is challenge, response, naming and recording. Now this becoming is strife, this becoming is pain, is it not? It is a constant struggle: I am this, and I want to become that.</p><p id="b3204c84-71fe-4870-824c-993d5a188f70" class="">Therefore, then, the problem is: Is there not action without this becoming? Is there not action without this pain, without this constant battle? If there is no end, there is no actor because action with an end in view creates the actor. But can there be action without an end in view, and therefore no actor – that is without the desire for a result? Such action is not a becoming, and therefore not a strife. There is a state of action, a state of experiencing, without the experiencer and the experience. This sounds rather philosophical but it is really quite simple.</p><p id="9fc2f723-f79b-4d48-8d41-10f2fe9f4bc0" class="">In the moment of experiencing, you are not aware of yourself as the experiencer apart from the experience; you are in a state of experiencing. Take a very simple example: you are angry. In that moment of anger there is neither the experiencer nor the experience; there is only experiencing. But the moment you come out of it, a split second after the experiencing, there is the experiencer and the experience, the actor and the action with an end in view – which is to get rid of or to suppress the anger. We are in this state repeatedly, in the state of experiencing; but we always come out of it and give it a term, naming and recording it, and thereby giving continuity to becoming.</p><p id="e214fa73-cf3d-4bde-a9a6-1fb9efc18ef9" class="">If we can understand action in the fundamental sense of the word then that fundamental understanding will affect our superficial activities also; but first we must understand the fundamental nature of action. Now is action brought about by an idea? Do you have an idea first and act afterwards? Or does action come first and then, because action creates conflict, you build around it an idea? Does action create the actor or does the actor come first?</p><p id="6107da47-8551-4950-a70e-b5f9168b8374" class="">It is very important to discover which comes first. If the idea comes first, then action merely conforms to an idea, and therefore it is no longer action but imitation, compulsion according to an idea. It is very important to realize this; because, as our society is mostly constructed on the intellectual or verbal level, the idea comes first with all of us and action follows. Action is then the handmaid of an idea, and the mere construction of ideas is obviously detrimental to action. Ideas breed further ideas, and when there is merely the breeding of ideas there is antagonism, and society becomes top-heavy with the intellectual process of ideation. Our social structure is very intellectual; we are cultivating the intellect at the expense of every other factor of our being and therefore we are suffocated with ideas.</p><p id="8af0d85b-8982-442f-818c-4629c910b108" class="">Can ideas ever produce action, or do ideas merely mould thought and therefore limit action? When action is compelled by an idea, action can never liberate man. It is extraordinarily important for us to understand this point. If an idea shapes action, then action can never bring about the solution to our miseries because, before it can be put into action, we have first to discover how the idea comes into being. The investigation of ideation, of the building up of ideas, whether of the socialists, the capitalists, the communists, or of the various religions, is of the utmost importance, especially when our society is at the edge of a precipice, inviting another catastrophe, another excision. Those who are really serious in their intention to discover the human solution to our many problems must first understand this process of ideation.</p><p id="ad03ffc9-5236-4e9f-b3ae-3c421366ebfe" class="">What do we mean by an idea? How does an idea come into being? And can idea and action be brought together? Suppose I have an idea and I wish to carry it out. I seek a method of carrying out that idea, and we speculate, waste our time and energies in quarrelling over how the idea should be carried out. So, it is really very important to find out how ideas come into being; and after discovering the truth of that we can discuss the question of action. Without discussing ideas, merely to find out how to act has no meaning.</p><p id="95f6f317-3806-4e07-b489-1798306ae731" class="">Now how do you get an idea – a very simple idea, it need not be philosophical, religious or economic? Obviously it is a process of thought, is it not? Idea is the outcome of a thought process. Without a thought process, there can be no idea. So I have to understand the thought process itself before I can understand its product, the idea. What do we mean by thought ? When do you think? Obviously thought is the result of a response, neurological or psychological, is it not? It is the immediate response of the senses to a sensation, or it is psychological, the response of stored-up memory. There is the immediate response of the nerves to a sensation, and there is the psychological response of stored-up memory, the influence of race, group, guru, family, tradition, and so on – all of which you call thought. So the thought process is the response of memory, is it not? You would have no thoughts if you had no memory; and the response of memory to a certain experience brings the thought process into action.</p><p id="cfa185ae-00d2-47ae-9348-2daa2b759120" class="">Say, for example, I have the stored-up memories of nationalism, calling myself a Hindu. That reservoir of memories of past responses actions, implications, traditions, customs, responds to the challenge of a Mussulman, a Buddhist or a Christian, and the response of memory to the challenge inevitably brings about a thought process. Watch the thought process operating in yourself and you can test the truth of this directly. You have been insulted by someone, and that remains in your memory; it forms part of the background. When you meet the person, which is the challenge, the response is the memory of that insult. So the response of memory, which is the thought process, creates an idea; therefore the idea is always conditioned – and this is important to understand. That is to say the idea is the result of the thought process, the thought process is the response of memory, and memory is always conditioned. Memory is always in the past, and that memory is given life in the present by a challenge. Memory has no life in itself; it comes to life in the present when confronted by a challenge. And all memory, whether dormant or active, is conditioned, is it not?</p><p id="889cd7b6-c317-4bdc-aa05-fc8f35fd9684" class="">Therefore there has to be quite a different approach. You have to find out for yourself, inwardly, whether you are acting on an idea, and if there can be action without ideation. Let us find out what that is: action which is not based on an idea.</p><p id="288d4eb3-989f-4b9a-83af-01b09aaac6d9" class="">When do you act without ideation? When is there an action which is not the result of experience? An action based on experience is, as we said, limiting, and therefore a hindrance. Action which is not the outcome of an idea is spontaneous when the thought process, which is based on experience, is not controlling action; which means that there is action independent of experience when the mind is not controlling action. That is the only state in which there is understanding: when the mind, based on experience, is not guiding action: when thought, based on experience, is not shaping action. What is action, when there is no thought process? Can there be action without thought process? That is I want to build a bridge, a house. I know the technique, and the technique tells me how to build it. We call that action. There is the action of writing a poem, of painting, of governmental responsibilities, of social, environmental responses. All are based on an idea or previous experience, shaping action. But is there an action when there is no ideation?</p><p id="d6a6c491-dd16-4791-be03-57c73d12f16e" class="">Surely there is such action when the idea ceases; and the idea ceases only when there is love. Love is not memory. Love is not experience. Love is not the thinking about the person that one loves, for then it is merely thought. You cannot think of love. You can think of the person you love or are devoted to – your guru, your image, your wife, your husband; but the thought, the symbol, is not the real which is love. Therefore love is not an experience.</p><p id="07808c4d-056b-4d2e-b62c-461787755f17" class="">When there is love there is action, is there not, and is that action not liberating? It is not the result of mentation, and there is no gap between love and action, as there is between idea and action. Idea is always old, casting its shadow on the present and we are ever trying to build a bridge between action and idea. When there is love – which is not mentation, which is not ideation, which is not memory, which is not the outcome of an experience, of a practised discipline – then that very love is action. That is the only thing that frees. So long as there is mentation, so long as there is the shaping of action by an idea which is experience, there can be no release; and so long as that process continues, all action is limited. When the truth of this is seen, the quality of love, which is not mentation, which you cannot think about, comes into being.</p><p id="7a67afe4-6650-44e8-90cc-223907a7a6f8" class="">One has to be aware of this total process, of how ideas come into being, how action springs from ideas, and how ideas control action and therefore limit action, depending on sensation. It doesn’t matter whose ideas they are, whether from the left or from the extreme right. So long as we cling to ideas, we are in a state in which there can be no experiencing at all. Then we are merely living in the field of time in the past, which gives further sensation, or in the future, which is another form of sensation. It is only when the mind is free from idea that there can be experiencing.</p><p id="a2e2f4b1-29d9-489b-8f17-e2abe9ba89f0" class="">Ideas are not truth; and truth is something that must be experienced directly, from moment to moment. It is not an experience which you want – which is then merely sensation. Only when one can go beyond the bundle of ideas – which is the `me’, which is the mind, which has a partial or complete continuity – only when one can go beyond that, when thought is completely silent, is there a state of experiencing. Then one shall know what truth is.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="4ae11895-27bb-4fb1-a70b-6bb62b046bc2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Action and Conflict</summary><p id="efa92fbd-37b2-40fd-bbe4-d42706b1603f" class="">Observing the state of the world increasingly clarifies the need for a radically different course of action. Worldwide, including in India, one witnesses confusion, profound sorrow, suffering, starvation, and a pervasive decline. We are all aware of this, often through newspapers, magazines, and books, but it often remains on an intellectual level, seemingly beyond our capacity to affect. Humanity finds itself in despair, enveloped in sorrow, frustration, and surrounded by chaos. The more we scrutinize and delve into this situation—not just intellectually or verbally, but by engaging in discussion, observation, action, inquiry, and examination—the more we recognize the deep confusion among human beings. Many seem utterly lost, believing that their particular actions, whether in social work, prayer, or other activities, will save the world. Yet, the world remains in turmoil, and we persist in repeating futile prayers in the hope of stopping wars. People align themselves with specific groups, political parties, religious sects, and cling to the past and the familiar.</p><p id="3891a6fe-c6ae-4a08-9723-0db9698fd2d7" class="">We readily admit to the chaos, decline, and suffering that envelops us, but we rarely delve deeply into why this state of affairs persists. Instead, we offer superficial explanations, such as not following God or lacking love, providing platitudes with no real value.</p><p id="a552192e-58ae-48e4-bbe1-6cc7a3782357" class="">During these discussions, one question must have arisen: Why? Why is there such chaos and confusion? When we delve deeply into this question, we may discover that human beings are fundamentally lazy. Laziness, indifference, and sluggishness contribute to the chaos. We accept the easiest path, which involves adapting to our environment, culture, and conditions without questioning. This acceptance breeds profound laziness. It&#x27;s crucial to acknowledge that we are inherently lazy. We believe we&#x27;ve solved the problems of life by adopting beliefs and saying, &quot;I believe in this or that.&quot; These beliefs often stem from fear and reflect our inability to confront that fear, which ultimately reveals deep-rooted laziness.</p><p id="52baa9db-3da0-44ea-822c-67cf5f2b7239" class="">Many of us fall into patterns of thought and action and then simply remain there because it&#x27;s the easiest way to live. We may have initially thought about it, but once we&#x27;ve settled into a routine, we stop thinking. We let ourselves be carried along by external events or the influence of our social circles. This provides a sense of satisfaction, as we believe we&#x27;re doing meaningful work. We&#x27;re afraid to question our religion, community, beliefs, social structures, nationalism, or war, so we unquestioningly accept them. Our inherent laziness prevents us from questioning, exploring, or examining deeply. It prevents us from addressing more profound issues.</p><p id="c362a93d-31ec-4c34-9079-932147eeb4c5" class="">Conscious of the chaos within and around us, we often hope that external events or leaders, gurus, or authorities will bring order. For centuries, we have looked to others to solve our problems. Following someone else is fundamentally lazy. These individuals may have some insights or visions, but relying on their guidance without questioning is indolent. What we truly desire is satisfaction and comfort, someone to tell us what to do, which reveals our deep-rooted laziness. We avoid thinking deeply and wiping away all difficulties.</p><p id="58d1e948-42a3-4105-bf4f-5370947b9869" class="">This indolence not only prevents us from questioning and examining but also hinders us from addressing a more profound issue: the nature of action itself. The world is in chaos, and we are in misery. None of the existing solutions, doctrines, beliefs, or meditative practices have solved anything. To bring about a different mindset and a higher quality of existence, we must understand the nature of action. Therefore, we need to explore what action is—not right versus wrong action, but simply action, as there is no inherent right or wrong in it. Categorizing action as right or wrong leads to conformity and stifles true inquiry. When people claim that certain actions are right or wrong, we tend to follow their lead, whether they are successful lawyers, businessmen, gurus, or politicians.</p><p id="c22a26da-bf93-45ab-90c7-db1d5ba0f76b" class="">This evening, we must strive to discover what action truly is. We should not approach it in terms of right or wrong, as such distinctions lead us astray. Instead, there is only action, which encompasses all aspects of living. Engaging in action with a specific method or system encourages indolence, trapping us in repetitive patterns. Therefore, we must be vigilant and avoid falling into the trap of complacency.</p><p id="e4529989-efd8-4828-bba7-44e0f3fb3aa4" class="">To truly grasp the essence of action, we must listen attentively. Listening is a challenging task. It requires us to listen with the intent of understanding, not just to oppose or agree. We must listen to discover for ourselves, free from preconceived notions and desires for others to validate our perspectives. Listening demands a quiet mind and full attention. Only a quiet, attentive mind can genuinely listen. Unfortunately, most of us prefer talking and expressing ourselves because we are laden with opinions and ideas, often borrowed from others. We rely on these slogans and platitudes, mistakenly believing they grant us a profound understanding of life. To listen genuinely, we must quiet our minds, attend to the world around us, and hear the cries of human hearts, the chaos, our own misery, and the desperation that plagues society.</p><p id="f1e6e0cf-920c-4c1c-8ec9-641636bc74d5" class="">Learning is not an additive process; it is not about accumulating knowledge. Learning involves a quiet mind and focused attention. Most importantly, it requires negation—questioning and challenging existing beliefs and thought patterns. While knowledge has its place in technology and skills, relying on knowledge born from ideas stifles genuine learning. Maturity is not a matter of time or evolution; it arises from the act of learning. A mature mind listens attentively, questions deeply, and examines hesitantly, never settling into rigid patterns. Laziness hinders us from achieving such maturity.</p><p id="ef84b2a7-bc8f-4af9-a71a-bc0c55c0bb7a" class="">To uncover a new form of action that transcends the patterns of the past, we must understand the limitations of thought. Thought cannot lead us to a state of love, which is essential for any meaningful change. Love is not synonymous with pleasure or security, as our conventional understanding might suggest. Pleasure is a product of thought, and thought thrives on contradiction, leading to conflict and suffering. Love, on the other hand, is a negative state that defies thought&#x27;s inherent contradictions. To explore and understand this love, we must first grasp the limitations of thought.</p><p id="033a76ba-a9ba-459a-ab4a-cbe90e20e65f" class="">In essence, genuine love cannot coexist with self-centeredness, righteousness, ambition, greed, envy, and competition—characteristics rooted in positive thinking. True love requires freedom from these destructive traits. It transcends sentimentality, devotion, and adherence to tradition. It cannot be cultivated through positive actions or thought processes. To truly love, we must understand the workings of thought.</p><p id="632ad8f3-a0b6-45f2-bc89-f4534042240e" class="">To find a new mode of action devoid of conflict, we must undergo a profound transformation—a transformation grounded in negation and emptiness. This transformation begins with recognizing the futility of our current way of life and thought patterns, followed by the abandonment of these patterns. This process of negation is not embittered or cynical; it arises from a clear perception of the limitations of the old ways. When we abandon something, we make room for the new. Unfortunately, many of us are afraid to relinquish the old, fearing that we will translate the new into familiar terms. True transformation, however, emerges only when we embrace emptiness.</p><p id="dca4147c-cc7a-486b-973e-2239eab283cb" class="">In our quest for action free from conflict, we must be willing to listen to the entire structure of our existing way of life. We should comprehend this structure in its entirety, as understanding the futility of living this way will propel us to leave it behind. When we discard something, we create space for the new. But often, we fear relinquishing the old, as we worry about imposing familiar interpretations onto the new. True transformation occurs when we accept emptiness and embrace the negation of the past.</p><p id="aa4743dc-abf5-4513-952f-56098c1c77c8" class="">We often hesitate to abandon the old ways because we try to relate the new to the old, striving to translate it within the framework of our existing understanding. However, we must be willing to break free from this tendency. True action, devoid of conflict, can only emerge when we disentangle ourselves from the past and engage with life in an entirely new way. This new dimension defies description by words, thoughts, or experiences; it exists beyond the realm of human understanding.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="3cee3869-9460-46ce-a218-74f8e5103252" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Action without Purpose</summary><p id="88a0bd14-cbac-43da-875a-ba047ae1f795" class="">HE BELONGED TO various and widely different organizations, and was active in them all. He wrote and talked, collected money, organized. He was aggressive, insistent and effective. He was a very useful person, much in demand, and was forever going up and down the land. He had been through the political agitations, had gone to prison, followed the leaders, and now he was becoming an important person in his own right. He was all for the immediate carrying out of great schemes; and like all these educated people, he was versed in philosophy. He said he was a man of action, and not a contemplative; he used a Sanskrit phrase which was intended to convey a whole philosophy of action. The very assertion that he was a man of action implied that he was one of the essential elements of life – perhaps not he personally, but the type. He had classified himself and thereby blocked the understanding of himself.</p><p id="13075611-1729-4e8b-ab6b-163ae95fc657" class="">Labels seem to give satisfaction. We kept the category to which we are supposed to belong as a satisfying explanation of life. We are worshippers of words and labels; we never seem to go beyond the symbol, to comprehend the worth of the symbol. By calling ourselves this or that, we ensure ourselves against further disturbance, and settle back. One of the curses of ideologies and organized beliefs is the comfort, the deadly gratification they offer. They put us to sleep, and in the sleep we dream, and the dream becomes action. How easily we are distracted! And most of us want to be distracted; most of us are tired out with incessant conflict, and distractions become a necessity, they become more important than what is. We can play with distractions, but not with what is; distractions are illusions, and there is a perverse delight in them.</p><p id="769e569f-88b1-4cf0-8f9b-069402413933" class="">What is action? What is the process of action? Why do we act? Mere activity is not action, surely; to keep busy is not action, is it? The housewife is busy, and would you call that action? ‘No, of course not. She is only concerned with everyday, petty affairs. A man of action is occupied with larger problems and responsibilities. Occupation with wider and deeper issues may be called action, not only political but spiritual. It demands capacity, efficiency, organized efforts a sustained drive towards a purpose.

What are wider issues? Are they separate from everyday existence? Is action apart from the total process of life? Is there action when there is no integration of all the many layers of existence? Without understanding and so integrating the total process of life, is not action mere destructive activity? Man is a total process, and action must be the outcome of this totality.</p><p id="dddf7ddc-1374-4eef-9dc8-c352c1792de6" class="">‘But that would imply not only inaction, but indefinite postponement. There is an urgency of action, and it is no good philosophizing about it.’ We are not philosophizing, but only wondering if your so-called action is not doing infinite harm. Reform always needs further reform. Partial action is no action at all, it brings about disintegration. If you will have the patience, we can find now, not in the future, that action which is total, integrated. Can purposive action be called action? To have a purpose, an ideal, and work towards it – is that action? When action is for a result, is it action?</p><p id="1f9dd0ae-07fb-414f-856d-e8eafded31a4" class="">‘How else can you act?’ You call action that which has a result, an end in view, do you not? You plan the end, or you have an idea, a belief, and work towards it. Working towards an object, an end, a goal, factual or psychological, is what is generally called action. This process can be understood in relation to some physical fact, such as building a bridge; but is it as easily understood with regard to psychological purposes? Surely, we are talking of the psychological purpose, the ideology, the ideal, or the belief towards which you are working. Would you call action this working towards a psychological purpose?</p><p id="1a1f27a2-1b2e-43e7-a7e0-a1b7441a88fc" class="">‘Action without a purpose is no action at all, it is death. Inaction is death.’ Inaction is not the opposite of action, it is quite a different state, but for the moment that is irrelevant; we may discuss that later, but let us come back to our point. Working towards an end, an ideal, is generally called action, is it not? But how does the ideal come into being?, Is it entirely different from what is). Is antithesis different and apart from thesis? Is the ideal of non-violence wholly other than violence? Is not the ideal self-projected? Is it not homemade? In acting towards a purpose, an ideal, you are pursuing a self-projection, are you not?</p><p id="6a8ab769-d5ee-403d-9a05-0cb52e81c9a2" class="">‘Is the ideal a self-projection?’ You are this, and you want to become that. Surely, that is the outcome of your thought. It may not be the outcome of your own thought, but it is born of thought, is it not? Thought projects the ideal; the ideal is part of thought. The ideal is not something beyond thought; it is thought itself. ‘What’s wrong with thought? Why shouldn’t thought create the ideal?’ You are this, which does not satisfy, so you want to be that. If there were an understanding of this, would that come into being? Because you do not understand this, you create that, hoping through that to understand or to escape from this. Thought creates the ideal as well as the problem; the ideal is a self-projection, and your working towards that self-projection is what you call action, action with a purpose. So your action is within the limits of your own projection, whether God or the State. This movement within your own bounds is the activity of the dog chasing its tail; and is that action?</p><p id="9d7df57c-b679-45b4-856c-8be81ea7e0d3" class="">‘But is it possible to act without a purpose?’ Of course it is. If you see the truth of action with a purpose, then there is just action. Such action is the only effective action, it is the only radical revolution. ‘You mean action without the self, don’t you?’ Yes, action without the idea. The idea is the self identified with God or with the State. Such identified action only creates more conflict, more confusion and misery. But it is hard for the man of so-called action to put aside the idea. Without the ideology he feels lost, and he is; so he is not a man of action, but a man caught in his own self-projections whose activities are the glorification of himself. His activities contribute to separation, to disintegration.</p><p id="19558445-5597-4298-9e4d-6e249530fcc6" class="">‘Then what is one to do?’ Understand what your activity is, and only then is there action.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a65f6e02-4171-49aa-b887-4cf95a1fbcf2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Conflict</summary><p id="e93c241e-92ee-43ec-a34f-6489e1608934" class="">Conflict is an intrinsic aspect of the human condition, manifesting both externally in our interactions with the world and internally within the confines of our own minds.

This inherent dissonance is the crucible from which all conflict emerges, manifesting in the external world as a reflection of our internal strife. The very fabric of our being is interwoven with these contradictions, leading to a life marked by struggle, resistance, and the ceaseless quest for resolution.</p><h3 id="8e6489bb-6bba-4858-95ec-487298e9a142" class="">The Anatomy of Desire: The Root of Discord</h3><p id="4b6a2958-0f74-4d55-a69f-8c2f778217ac" class="">At the core of conflict lies desire, a force that springs from our interaction with the world. Desire, in its essence, is the response to sensation, a sensation that arises from contact, which in turn is born of perception. However, the awareness of desire only surfaces in the presence of disturbance, when the equilibrium of our being is disrupted by the pursuit of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. This disturbance is the crucible of self-consciousness, the birthplace of conflict. Desire, therefore, is not merely an abstract concept but the very embodiment of conflict.</p><h3 id="87d77e68-a7ff-4b2a-a8e2-c79ac69c2670" class="">The Illusion of Resolution: The Futility of Effort</h3><p id="803114b6-bf3c-4d87-b037-82e377f97ccd" class="">In our quest to transcend conflict, we often resort to resistance, suppression, or the pursuit of alternatives. Yet, these efforts only serve to perpetuate the cycle of conflict, for they are rooted in the same division that gave rise to conflict in the first place. The discovery of the cause, the pursuit of explanations, or the application of methodologies does not liberate us from the grips of conflict. True freedom lies not in the eradication of desire but in understanding the nature of disturbance and embracing the totality of our existence.</p><h3 id="52e34bc2-d026-42ee-80c8-f0ee1224635a" class="">The Path to Harmony: Awareness and Understanding</h3><p id="3a678d96-1be8-463b-8ae3-a1a8a6e0db54" class="">The key to transcending conflict lies in the art of observation, in the ability to see the totality of conflict without resorting to judgment, resistance, or escape. It is in the undivided attention to the moment, where the observer is not separate from the observed, that the energy of understanding is released. This energy, untainted by effort, illuminates the nature of conflict, allowing for a natural dissolution of discord.

This realm beyond conflict is not the product of desire or the result of effort; it is the essence of awareness, the understanding of the intricate dance of life. In this state, the self, with its burdens of memory, naming, and recording, dissolves, giving way to the inexhaustible, the boundless.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="c1b08464-a2a8-4f3e-b120-b730d4716985" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Contradiction</summary><p id="1746bbed-77b9-467a-8ea0-1d13090bc620" class="">WE SEE CONTRADICTION in us and about us; because we are in contradiction, there is lack of peace in us and therefore outside us. There is in us a constant state of denial and assertion – what we want to be and what we are. The state of contradiction creates conflict, and this conflict does not bring about peace – which is a simple, obvious fact. This inward contradiction should not be translated into some kind of philosophical dualism because that is a very easy escape. That is by saying that contradiction is a state of dualism we think we have solved it – which is obviously a mere convention, a contributory escape from actuality.</p><p id="ac188db7-f42a-48f4-a13b-bf56b44e4749" class="">Now, what do we mean by conflict, by contradiction? Why is there a contradiction in me? – this constant struggle to be something apart from what I am. I am this, and I want to be that. This contradiction in us is a fact, not a metaphysical dualism. Metaphysics has no significance in understanding what is. We may discuss, say, dualism, what it is, if it exists, and so on; but of what value is it if we don’t know that there is contradiction in us, opposing desires, opposing interests, opposing pursuits? I want to be good, and I am not able to be. This contradiction, this opposition in us, must be understood because it creates conflict; and in conflict, in struggle, we cannot create individually. Let us be clear on the state we are in. There is contradiction, so there must be struggle; and struggle is destruction, waste. In that state, we can produce nothing but antagonism, strife, more bitterness and sorrow. If we can understand this fully and hence be free of contradiction, then there can be inward peace, which will bring understanding of each other.</p><p id="40fb292c-0296-4105-b3b2-775de341535f" class="">Seeing that conflict is destructive, wasteful, why is it that in each of us there is contradiction? To understand that, we must go a little further. Why is there a sense of opposing desires? I do not know if we are aware of it in ourselves – this contradiction, this sense of wanting and not wanting, remembering something and trying to forget it in order to find something new. Just watch it. It is very simple and very normal. It is not something extraordinary. The fact is, there is contradiction. Then why does this contradiction arise?</p><p id="671bfbc4-e512-42c0-a46a-92d3634f151f" class="">What do we mean by contradiction? Does it not imply an impermanent state which is being opposed by another impermanent state? I think I have a permanent desire, I posit in myself a permanent desire, and another desire arises which contradicts it; this contradiction brings about conflict, which is waste. That is to say there is a constant denial of one desire by another desire, one pursuit overcoming another pursuit. Now, is there such a thing as a permanent desire? Surely, all desire is impermanent – not metaphysically, but actually. I want a job. That is I look to a certain job as a means of happiness; and when I get it, I am dissatisfied. I want to become the manager, then the owner, and so on and on, not only in this world, but in the so-called spiritual world – the teacher becoming the principal, the priest becoming the bishop, the pupil becoming the master.</p><p id="c04954c5-0d2e-47e5-a3ed-f99981893e7c" class="">This constant becoming, arriving at one state after another, brings about contradiction, does it not? Therefore, why not look at life not as one permanent desire but as a series of fleeting desires always in opposition to each other? Hence the mind need not be in a state of contradiction. If I regard life not as a permanent desire but as a series of temporary desires which are constantly changing, then there is no contradiction.</p><p id="d6cbff27-6e0f-4120-aeed-8a8c5176e88d" class="">Contradiction arises only when the mind has a fixed point of desire; that is when the mind does not regard all desire as moving, transient, but seizes upon one desire and makes that into a permanency – only then, when other desires arise, is there contradiction. But all desires are in constant movement, there is no fixation of desire. There is no fixed point in desire; but the mind establishes a fixed point because it treats everything as a means to arrive, to gain; and there must be contradiction, conflict, as long as one is arriving. You want to arrive, you want to succeed, you want to find an ultimate God or truth which will be your permanent satisfaction. Therefore you are not seeking truth, you are not seeking God. You are seeking lasting gratification, and that gratification you clothe with an idea, a respectable-sounding word such as God, truth; but actually we are all seeking gratification, and we place that gratification, that satisfaction, at the highest point, calling it God, and the lowest point is drink. So long as the mind is seeking gratification, there is not much difference between God and drink. Socially, drink may be bad, but the inward desire for gratification, for gain, is even more harmful, is it not? If you really want to find truth, you must be extremely honest, not merely at the verbal level but altogether; you must be extraordinarily clear, and you cannot be clear if you are unwilling to face facts.</p><p id="a222df45-033e-49df-98c0-c85766c66dcf" class="">Now, what brings about contradiction in each one of us? Surely it is the desire to become something, is it not? We all want to become something: to become successful in the world and, inwardly, to achieve a result. So long as we think in terms of time, in terms of achievement, in terms of position, there must be contradiction. After all, the mind is the product of time. Thought is based on yesterday, on the past; and so long as thought is functioning within the field of time, thinking in terms of the future, of becoming, gaining, achieving, there must be contradiction because then we are incapable of facing exactly what is. Only in realizing, in understanding, in being choicelessly aware of what is, is there a possibility of freedom from that disintegrating factor which is contradiction.</p><p id="f1cb5874-0b1f-4dd8-8f52-a4a1ca618a0e" class="">Therefore it is essential to understand the whole process of our thinking, for it is there that we find contradiction. Thought itself has become a contradiction because we have not understood the total process of ourselves; and that understanding is possible only when we are fully aware of our thought, not as an observer operating upon his thought, but integrally and without choice – which is extremely arduous. Then only is there the dissolution of that contradiction which is so detrimental, so painful.</p><p id="f700513a-e3b9-4f79-b451-6c22c38f40e8" class="">So long as we are trying to achieve a psychological result, so long as we want inward security, there must be a contradiction in our life. I do not think that most of us are aware of this contradiction, or if we are, we do not see its real significance. On the contrary, contradiction gives us an impetus to live; the very element of friction makes us feel that we are alive. The effort, the struggle of contradiction, gives us a sense of vitality. That is why we love wars, that is why we enjoy the battle of frustrations. So long as there is the desire to achieve a result, which is the desire to be psychologically secure, there must be a contradiction; and where there is contradiction, there cannot be a quiet mind. Quietness of mind is essential to understand the whole significance of life. Thought can never be tranquil; thought, which is the product of time, can never find that which is timeless, can never know that which is beyond time. The very nature of our thinking is a contradiction, because we are always thinking in terms of the past or of the future; therefore we are never fully cognizant, fully aware of the present.</p><p id="a42a6c2a-f7bb-403e-a9fa-4364d6a2995f" class="">To be fully aware of the present is an extraordinarily difficult task because the mind is incapable of facing a fact directly without deception. Thought is the product of the past and therefore it can only think in terms of the past or the future; it cannot be completely aware of a fact in the present. So long as thought, which is the product of the past, tries to eliminate contradiction and all the problems that it creates, it is merely pursuing a result, trying to achieve an end, and such thinking only creates more contradiction and hence conflict, misery and confusion in us and, therefore, about us.</p><p id="4f26d71d-98ec-4307-bb25-b18fb96e6008" class="">To be free of contradiction, one must be aware of the present without choice. How can there be choice when you are confronted with a fact? Surely the understanding of the fact is made impossible so long as thought is trying to operate upon the fact in terms of becoming, changing, altering. Therefore self-knowledge is the beginning of understanding; without self-knowledge, contradiction and conflict will continue. To know the whole process, the totality of oneself, does not require any expert, any authority. The pursuit of authority only breeds fear. No expert, no specialist, can show us how to understand the process of the self. One has to study it for oneself. You and I can help each other by talking about it, but none can unfold it for us, no specialist, no teacher, can explore it for us. We can be aware of it only in our relationship – in our relationship to things, to property, to people and to ideas. In relationship we shall discover that contradiction arises when action is approximating itself to an idea. The idea is merely the crystallization of thought as a symbol, and the effort to live up to the symbol brings about a contradiction.</p><p id="e6e76ae8-0626-46f6-8436-e8422cf2cfd8" class="">Thus, so long as there is a pattern of thought, contradiction will continue; to put an end to the pattern, and so to contradiction, there must be self-knowledge. This understanding of the self is not a process reserved for the few. The self is to be understood in our everyday speech, in the way we think and feel, in the way we look at another. If we can be aware of every thought, of every feeling, from moment to moment, then we shall see that in relationship the ways of the self are understood. Then only is there a possibility of that tranquillity of mind in which alone the ultimate reality can come into being.</p><p id="34b7d1d8-5309-4e50-ac36-c5b2ba5eee51" class="">Why do we have a fixed point, an ideal, since deviation from it creates contradiction? If there were no fixed point, no conclusion, there would be no contradiction. We establish a fixed point and then wander away from it, which is considered a contradiction. We come to a conclusion through devious ways and at different levels, and then try to live in accordance with that conclusion or ideal. As we cannot, a contradiction is created; and then we try to build a bridge between the fixed, the ideal, the conclusion, and the thought or act which contradicts it. This bridging is called consistency. And how we admire a man who is consistent, who sticks to his conclusion, to his ideal! Such a man we consider a saint. But the insane are also consistent, they also stick to their conclusions. There is no contradiction in a man who feels himself to be Napoleon, he is the embodiment of his conclusion; and a man who is completely identified with his ideal is obviously unbalanced.</p><p id="d0a5d6ed-c251-4ac7-8337-1c9b4b9b9f80" class="">The conclusion that we call an ideal may be established at any level, and it may be conscious or unconscious; and having established it, we try to approximate our action to it, which creates contradiction. What is important is not how to be consistent with the pattern, with the ideal, but to discover why we have cultivated this fixed point, this conclusion; for if we had no pattern, then contradiction would disappear. So, why have we the ideal, the conclusion? Does not the ideal prevent action? Does not the ideal come into being to modify action, to control action? Is it not possible to act without the ideal? The ideal is the response of the background, of conditioning, and so it can never be the means of liberating man from conflict and confusion. On the contrary, the ideal, the conclusion, increases division between man and man and so hastens the process of disintegration.</p><p id="4aae9b30-4c95-4d81-a2e7-a18da3d7c0c7" class="">If there is no fixed point, no ideal from which to deviate, there is no contradiction with its urge to be consistent; then there is only action from moment to moment, and that action will always be complete and true. The true is not an ideal, a myth, but the actual. The actual can be understood and dealt with. The understanding of the actual cannot breed enmity, whereas ideas do. Ideals can never bring about a fundamental revolution but only a modified continuity of the old. There is fundamental and constant revolution only in action from moment to moment which is not based on an ideal and so is free of conclusion.</p><p id="529f8747-d7b3-43e4-9201-44056d446011" class="">‘But a State cannot be run on this principle. There must be a goal, a planned action, a concentrated effort on a particular issue. What you say may be applicable to the individual, and I see in it great possibilities for myself; but it will not work in collective action.’</p><p id="bbbf49a1-36be-43e0-ab44-7c1fe92a8b23" class="">Planned action needs constant modification, there must be adjustment to changing circumstances. Action according to a fixed blueprint will inevitably fail if you do not take into consideration the physical facts and psychological pressures. If you plan to build a bridge, you must not only make a blueprint of it, but you have to study the soil, the terrain where it is going to be built, otherwise your planning will not be adequate. There can be complete action only when all the physical facts and psychological stresses of man’s total process are understood, and this understanding does not depend on any blueprint. It demands swift adjustment, which is intelligence; and it is only when there is no intelligence that we resort to conclusions, ideals, goals. The State is not static; its leaders may be, but the State, like the individual, is living, dynamic, and what is dynamic cannot be put in the strait-jacket of a blueprint, We generally build walls around the State, walls of conclusions, ideals, hoping to tie it down; but a living thing cannot be tied down without killing it, so we proceed to kill the State and then mould it according to our blueprint, according to the ideal. Only a dead thing can be forced to conform to a pattern; and as life is in constant movement, there is contradiction the moment we try to fit life into a fixed pattern or conclusion. Conformity to a pattern is the disintegration of the individual and so of the State. The ideal is not superior to life, and when we make it so there is confusion, antagonism and misery.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="fb81b274-81f3-41bd-aa95-fe667b0ed52f" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Clear Decisions</summary><p id="8809d50a-7617-4122-933a-e19c86562312" class="">If the mind cannot decide clearly, then problems arise; the very decision is a problem. When you decide, you make a decision between this and that – which means choice. When there is choice there is conflict; from that arise problems. But when you see very clearly, there is no choice, therefore there is no decision. You know the way from here to where you happen to live very well; you follow the road which is very clear. You have been on that road a hundred times, therefore there is no choice, although you may find a short cut which you may take next time. That is something mechanical there is no problem. The brain wants the same thing to happen again so that it may function automatically, mechanically, so that problems do not arise. The brain demands that it operate mechanically. Therefore it says, ‘I will discipline myself to function mechanically’, ‘I must have a belief, a purpose, a direction, so that I can set a path and follow it; and it follows that groove.</p><p id="e21a9458-d14b-44f3-a2f3-62a516c8866f" class="">What happens? Life will not allow that, there are all kinds of things happening; so thought resists, builds a wall of belief and this very resistance creates problems.</p><p id="6b3803f0-af9f-4d87-8c11-ed25c4781a9d" class="">When you have to decide between this and that, it means there is confusion: ‘should I, or should I not do this?, I only put that question to myself when I do not see clearly what is to be done. We choose out of confusion, not out of clarity. The moment you are clear your action is complete.</p><p id="8fd9bac0-cccb-43c7-912c-1c9de51486a8" class="">Have patience to look at it. You have to compare; compare what? Compare two materials, blue and white; you question whether you like this colour or that colour, whether you should go up this hill or that hill. You decide. ‘I prefer to go up this hill today and tomorrow I’ll go up the other’. The problem arises when one is dealing with the psyche, what to do within oneself. First watch what decision implies. To decide to do this or that, what is that decision based on? On choice, obviously. Should I do this, or should I do that? I realize that when there is choice there is confusion. So I see the truth of this, the fact, the ‘what is’, which is: where there is choice there must be confusion. Now why am I confused? Because I don’t know, or because I prefer one thing as opposed to another which is more pleasant, it may produce better results, greater fortune, or whatever it is. So I choose that. But in following that, I realize there is also frustration in it, which is pain. So I am caught again between fear and pleasure. Seeing I am caught in this, I ask, ‘Can I act without choice?’ That means: I have to be aware of all the implications of confusion and all the implications of decision; fur there is duality, the ‘decider’ and the thing decided upon. And therefore there is conflict and perpetuation of confusion.</p><p id="42f9c9f6-e483-467e-afa5-a5d40d2694ee" class="">You will say, to be aware of all the intricacies of this movement will take time. Will it take time? Or can it be seen instantly and therefore there is instant action? It only takes time when I am not aware of it. My brain, being conditioned, says, ‘I must decide’ decide according to the past; that is its habit. ‘I must decide what is right, what is wrong, what is duty, what is responsibility, what is love’. The decisions of the brain breed more conflict which is what the politicians throughout the world are doing. Now, can that brain be quiet, so that it sees the problem of confusion instantly, and acts because it is clear? Then there is no decision at all.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="5c167c6a-abbf-493e-871a-ff3d7386996a" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Cause and Effect, Conditioning</summary><p id="dc51b3ff-bc93-4aea-bf8d-6b3d982a654e" class="">APPARENTLY WE ARE always concerned with effects; psychologically we are always trying to change or modify these effects, or results. We never enquire very deeply into the cause of these effects. All our ways of thinking and acting have a cause, a ground, a reason, a motive. If the cause were to end, then what is beyond?</p><p id="46cc82cb-1295-40d6-a0e4-c1ac4146f46f" class="">One hopes you will not mind being reminded again that the speaker is completely anonymous. The speaker is not important. What is important is to find out for yourselves if what is being said is true or false, and that depends on intelligence. Intelligence is the uncovering of the false and totally rejecting it. Please bear in mind that together, in co-operation, we are investigating, examining, exploring into these problems. The speaker is not exploring, but you are exploring with him. There is no question of following him. There is no authority invested in him. This must be said over and over again as most of us have a tendency to follow, to accept, especially from those whom you think somewhat different or spiritually advanced all that nonsense. So please, if one may repeat over and over again: our minds and our brains are conditioned to follow as we follow a professor in a university; he informs and we accept because he certainly knows more of his subject than perhaps we do but here it is not a matter of that kind. The speaker is not informing you or urging you to accept those things that are said; but rather we should together, in co-operation, investigate into these human problems, which are very complex, need a great deal of observation, a great deal of energy and enquiry. But if you merely follow you are only following the image that you have created about him or about the symbolic meaning of the words. So please bear in mind all these facts. We are going to enquire together into what intelligence is. Is thought, our thinking, the way we act, the whole social, moral, or immoral, world in which we live, the activity of intelligence? One of the factors of intelligence is to uncover and explore; explore into the nature of the false, because in the understanding of the false, in the uncovering of that which is illusion, there is the truth, which is intelligence.</p><p id="10889183-85b8-45d1-afed-6f0437040732" class="">Has intelligence a cause? Thought has a cause. One thinks because one has past experiences, past accumulated information and knowledge. That knowledge is never complete, it must go hand in hand with ignorance, and from this ground of knowledge with its ignorance thought is born. Thought must be partial, limited, fragmented, because it is the outcome of knowledge, and knowledge can never be complete at any time. Thought must always be incomplete, insufficient, limited. And we use that thought, not recognizing the limitation of it; we live endlessly creating thoughts, and worshipping the things that thought has created. Thought has created wars and the instruments of war, and the terror of war. Thought has created the whole technological world. So, is thought, the activity of thought, which is to compare, to identify, to fulfil, to seek satisfaction, to seek security which are the result of thinking intelligent? The movement of thought is from the past to the present to the future which is the movement of time and thought has its cunningness, with its capacity to adjust itself, as no animal does except the human being.</p><p id="1dabbf2a-27cd-4414-983b-61aa7589c4f3" class="">So thought has causation, obviously. One wants to build a house; one wants to drive a car; one wants to be powerful, well-known; one is dull, but one will be clever, one will achieve, one will fulfil; all that is the movement of the centre from which thought arises. It is so obvious. Through the obvious we are going to penetrate to that which may be difficult. But first we must be very clear about the obvious. There is a cause and an effect, an effect that may be immediate or postponed. The movement from the cause to the effect is time. One has done something in the past which was not correct; the effect of that may be that one pays for it immediately, or perhaps in five years’ time. There is cause followed by an effect; the interval, whether it is a second or years, is the movement of time. But, is intelligence the movement of time? Think it over, examine it, because this is not a verbal clarification, it is not a verbal explanation; but perceive the reality of it, the truth of it.</p><p id="174742d9-8be0-44f5-9259-a1a9d603927d" class="">We are going into the various aspects of our daily living not some Utopian concept, or some ideological conclusion according to which we shall act we are investigating our lives, our lives which are the lives of all humanity; it is not my life or your life; life is a tremendous movement; and in that movement we have separated off parts which we call individual selves.</p><p id="ed236563-2c7d-4a42-81d5-dc8e3676c83a" class="">We are saying that where there is a cause, the effect can be ended with the ending of the cause. If one has tuberculosis it is the cause of one’s coughing and loss of blood; that cause can be cured and the effect will disappear. All one’s life is the movement of cause and effect: you flatter me, I am delighted and I flatter you. You say something unpleasant; I hate you. In all this movement there is cause and effect. Of course. We are asking: is there a life, a way of living, without causation? But first we must understand the implications of ending. One ends anger or greed in order to achieve something else; that ending leads to further cause. What is it to end? Is ending a continuation? One ends something and begins something else which is another form of the same thing. To go into this very deeply one has to understand the conflict of the opposites, the conflict of duality. One is greedy and for various social or economic reasons one must end it. In the ending of it one wants something else, which then is a cause. The something else is the result of the greed. In ending the greed one has merely replaced it by something else. One is violent by nature; violence has been inherited from the animal and so on. One wants to end violence because one feels it is too stupid. In trying to end violence one is trying to find a field which is non-violent, which has no shadow of violence in it. But one has not really ended violence, one has only translated that feeling into another feeling, but the principle is the same.</p><p id="96537b4a-7d02-4e9e-b8bc-eccf43e6145a" class="">If we go into this matter very carefully, deeply, it will affect our daily life; it may be the ending of conflict. Our life is in conflict, our consciousness is in conflict, it is confused, contradictory. Our consciousness is the result of thought. Thought is subject to causation; our consciousness is subject to causation. One observes that all one’s complex life with its contradictions, its imitation and conformity, its various conclusions with their opposites, is all a movement of causation. Can one end that causation by will, by a desire to have an orderly life? If one does, then that life is born out of causation because one is disorderly. Discovering the disorderliness of one’s life and wishing to have an orderly life, is in the chain of causation, one sees, therefore, that it will not be orderly.</p><p id="9cbf4e97-0310-4f40-a4f6-7a8f41826f29" class="">What is order? There is obviously the order of law which is based upon various experiences, judgements, necessities, conveniences, in order to restrain the ill-doer. That which we call social order, ethical order, political order, has essentially a basis of cause. Now we are asking, inwardly, psychologically, has order a cause? Do we recognize, see, that our lives are disorderly, contradictory, conforming, following, accepting, denying what we may want and accepting something else? The conflict between the various opposites is disorder. Because we accept one form of thought as order, we think its opposite is disorder. The opposite may create disorder, so we live always within the field of these opposites. So, will disorder end completely in our lives if we want order? One wants to live peacefully, to have a pleasant life with companionship and so on; that want is born out of disorder. The cause of the opposite is its own opposite. One hates, one must not hate; therefore one is trying not to hate, not to hate is the outcome of one’s hate. If there is no hate it has no opposite.</p><p id="ba3a4091-f219-4316-a5d7-19252cd9f86c" class="">Thought has created disorder. Let us see that fact. Thought has created disorder in the world through nationalism, through faiths, one is a Jew another is an Arab one believes and another does not believe. Those are all the activities of thought, which in itself is divisive; it cannot bring unity because in itself it is fragmented. That which is fragmented cannot see the whole. One discovers that one’s consciousness is entirely in disorder and one wants order, hoping thereby one will end conflict. There is a motive; that motive is the cause of my desire to have an orderly life. The desire for order is born there out of disorder. That desired order perpetuates disorder which is happening in political, religious and other fields.</p><p id="c6af1feb-7b65-4160-a992-6b99a3e1ef67" class="">Now one sees the cause of disorder; one does not move away from disorder. One sees the cause of it, that one is contradictory, that one is angry; one sees the confusion. One sees the cause of it. One is not moving away from the cause or the effect. One is the cause and one is the effect. One sees that one is the cause and that things that happen are oneself. Any movement away from that is to perpetuate disorder. So, is there an ending without a future? An ending of ‘what is’ that has no future? Any future projected by my demand for order is still the continuation of disorder. Is there an observation of my disorder and an ending of it without any cause?</p><p id="98bb51ca-21e1-4358-9ec5-68f312e0c5ab" class="">One is violent. There is violence in all human beings. The cause of that violence is essentially a self-centred movement. Another is also violent because he is self-centred. Therefore there is a battle between us. Thought is not pursuing non-violence, which is a form of violence. If one sees that very clearly then one is only concerned with violence. The cause of that violence may be so many contradictory demands, so many pressures and so on. So there are many causes and one cause of violence is the self. The self has many aspects, it hides behind many ideas; one is an idealist because that appeals to one and one wants to work for that ideal, but in the working for that ideal one is becoming more and more important and one covers that up by the ideal; the very escape from oneself is part of oneself. This whole movement is the cause of violence. An idealist wants to kill others because by killing them there may be a better world-you know all that goes on.</p><p id="b52579bf-3d70-49ec-a6d3-c4834687b153" class="">Our life is conditioned by many causes. Is there a way of living, psychologically, without a single cause? Please enquire into this. It is a marvellous enquiry; even to put that question demands some deep searching. One wants security; therefore one follows a guru. One may put on his robes or copy what he says, but deeply one wants to be safe. One clings to some idea, some image. But the image, the idea, the conclusion, the guru, can never bring about security. So one has to enquire into security. Is there such a thing as security, inwardly? Because one is uncertain, confused and another says he is not confused, one holds on to him. One’s demand is to find some kind of peace, hope, some kind of quietness in one’s life. He is not important but one’s desire is important. One will do whatever he wants and follow him. One is silly enough to do all that but when one enquires into the cause of it one discovers, deeply, that one wants protection, the feeling of being safe. Now, can there ever be security, psychologically? The very question implies the demand for intelligence. The very putting of that question is an outcome of intelligence. But if one says there is always security in one’s symbol, in one’s saviour, in this, in that, then one will not move away from it. But if one begins to enquire, to ask: is there security..? So, if there is a cause for security, it is not secure, because the desire for security is the opposite of security.</p><p id="eb5af1f8-e7fa-4617-b167-610ff3e6c51d" class="">Has love a cause? We said intelligence has no cause, it is intelligence, it is not your intelligence, or my intelligence. It is light. Where there’s light there is not my light or your light. The sun is not your sun or my sun; it is the clarity of light. Has love a cause? If it has not, then love and intelligence go together. When one says to one’s wife or one’s girlfriend, ‘I love you’, what does it mean? One loves God. One does not know anything about that being and one loves him; because there is fear, there is a demand for security, and the vast weight of tradition and the ‘sacred’ books encourage one to love that about which one knows nothing. So one says ‘I believe in god’. But if there is the discovery that intelligence is total security, and that love is something beyond all causation, which is order, then the universe is open because the universe is order.</p><p id="b7365290-b276-400f-b78c-ae7a34e22521" class="">Let us go into the question of what intelligent relationship is; not the relationship of thought with its image. Our brains are mechanical – mechanical in the sense that they are repetitive, never free, struggling within the same field, thinking they are free by moving from one corner to the other in the same field, which is choice, and thinking that choice is freedom, which is merely the same thing. One’s brain, which has evolved through ages of time, through tradition, through education, through conformity, through adjustment, has become mechanical. There may be parts of one’s brain which are free but one does not know, so do not assert that. Do not say: ‘Yes, there is part of me that is free; that is meaningless. The fact remains that the brain has become mechanical, traditional, repetitive, and that it has its own cunningness, its own capacity to adjustment, to discern. But it is always within a limited area and is fragmented. Thought has its home in the physical cells of the brain.</p><p id="c342dc8e-3da9-4309-8155-5bf9bf38593e" class="">The brain has become mechanical, as is exemplified when I say, ‘I am a Christian or I am not a Christian; I am a Hindu; I believe; I have faith; I do not have faith, it is all a mechanical repetitive process, reaction to another reaction, and so on. The human brain being conditioned, has its own artificial, mechanical intelligence like a computer. We will keep that expression mechanical intelligence. (Billions and billions of dollars are being spent to find out if a computer can operate exactly like the brain.) Thought, which is born of memory, knowledge, stored in the brain, is mechanical; it may have the capacity to invent but it is still mechanical invention is totally different from creation. Thought is trying to discover a different way of life, or a different social order. But any discovery of a social order by thought is still within the field of confusion. We are asking: is there an intelligence which has no cause and which can act in our relationships not the mechanical state of relationship which exists now?</p><p id="3b3cf9ea-273f-452c-a170-da38a98abeb1" class="">Our relationships are mechanical. One has certain biological urges and one fulfils them. One demands certain comforts, certain companionship because one is lonely or depressed and by holding on to another perhaps that depression will disappear. But in one’s relationships with another, intimate or otherwise, there is always a cause, a motive, a ground from which one establishes a relationship. That is mechanical. It has been happening for millennia; there appears always to have been a conflict between woman and man, a constant battle, each pursuing his or her own line, never meeting, like two railway lines. This relationship is always limited because it is from the activity of thought which itself is limited.</p><p id="5206a156-2fd7-477f-a0af-53e46737bb93" class="">Wherever there is limitation there must be conflict. In any form of association one belongs to this group and another belongs to another group there is solitude, isolation; where there is isolation there must be conflict. This is a law, not invented by the speaker, it is obviously so. Thought is ever in limitation and therefore isolating itself. Therefore, in relationship, where there is the activity of thought there must be conflict. See the reality of it. See the actuality of this fact, not as an idea, but as something that is happening in one’s active daily life divorces, quarrels, hating each other, jealousy; you know the misery of it all. The wife wants to hurt you, is jealous of you, and you are jealous; which are all mechanical reactions, the repetitive activity of thought in relationship, bringing conflict. That is a fact. Now how do you deal with that fact?</p><p id="1bcd0c6b-6008-4de0-815c-c7b4fa3b004e" class="">Here is a fact: your wife and you quarrel. She hates you, and also there is your mechanical response, you hate. You discover that it is the remembrance of things that have happened stored in the brain, continuing day after day. Your whole thinking is a process of isolation and she also is in isolation. Neither of you ever discovers the truth of the isolation. Now how do you look at that fact? What are you to do with that fact? What is your response? Do you face this fact with a motive, a cause? Be careful, do not say, ‘My wife hates me’, and smother it over although you also hate her, dislike her, don’t want to be with her, because you are both isolated. You are ambitious for one thing; she is ambitious for something else. So your relationship operates in isolation. Do you approach the fact with reason, with a ground, which are all motives? Or do you approach it without a motive, without cause? When you approach it without a cause what then happens? Watch it. Please do not jump to some conclusion, watch it in yourself. Previously you have approached this problem mechanically with a motive, with some reason, a ground from which you act. Now you see the foolishness of such an action because it is the result of thought. So, is there an approach to the fact without a single motive? That is, you have no motive, yet she may have a motive. Then if you have no motive how are you looking at the fact? The fact is not different from you, you are the fact. You are ambition, you are hate, you depend on somebody, you are that. There is an observation of the fact, which is yourself, without any kind of reason, motive. Is that possible? If you do not do that you live perpetually in conflict. And you may say that that is the way of life. If you accept that as the way of life, that is your business, your pleasure. Your brain, tradition and habit, tell you that it is inevitable. But when you see the absurdity of such acceptance then you are bound to see that all this travail is you yourself; you are the enemy, not her.</p><p id="a2313fe9-3108-4583-a41d-f29af5ce9a16" class="">You have met the enemy and discovered it is yourself. So, can you observe this whole movement of ‘me’, the self, and the traditional acceptance that you are separate which becomes foolish when you examine the whole field of the consciousness of humanity? You have come to a point in understanding what intelligence is. We said that intelligence is without a cause, as love is without a cause. If love has a cause, it is not love, obviously. If you are ‘intelligent’ so that the government employs you, or ‘intelligent’ because you are following me, that is not intelligence, that is capacity: Intelligence has no cause. Therefore, see if you are looking at yourself with a cause. Are you looking at this fact that you are thinking, working, feeling, in isolation and that isolation must inevitably breed everlasting conflict? That isolation is yourself; you are the enemy. When you look at yourself without a motive, is there ‘self’? Self as the cause and the effect; self as the result of time, which is the movement from cause to effect? When you look at yourself, look at this fact, without a cause, there is the ending of something and the beginning of something totally new.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="e401421e-33ea-45b9-85c7-48b16af56776" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>We are asleep and not aware</summary><p id="1c31bd00-36c5-4be4-8fcc-382047105d85" class="">One of the most important things to be understood about man is that man is asleep.

Hence great effort is needed to be alert, to be attentive, to be watchful, to become a witness.</p><p id="cc0f62f6-bef6-4c26-8a7f-942e416968ca" class="">If on any one single theme all the buddhas of the world agree, this is the theme: that man as he is is asleep, and man as he should be should be awake. Wakefulness is the goal, and wakefulness is the taste of all their teachings. Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Jesus, Buddha, Bahauddin, Kabir, Nanak -- all the awakened ones have been teaching one single theme, in different languages, in different metaphors, but their song is the same. Just as the sea tastes of salt -- whether the sea is tasted from the north or from the east or from the west, the sea always tastes of salt -- the taste of buddhahood is wakefulness.</p><p id="31c05e4a-4ce4-418e-8c30-a5c32b8251af" class="">But you will not make any effort if you go on believing that you are already awake; then there is no question of making any effort. Why bother? And you have created religions, gods, prayers, rituals, out of your dreams -- your gods are as much part of your dreams as anything else. Your politics is part of your dreams, your religions are part of your dreams, your poetry, your painting, your art -- whatsoever you do, because you are asleep, you make it according to your own state of mind.</p><p id="44c8f368-015c-4904-8ac6-447488e9c9a3" class="">The Bible says God created man in his own image -- the truth seems to be just the opposite: man has created God in his own image. Your gods are false because you are false. Your religion is pseudo because you are pseudo. Your scriptures cannot have any significance because you don&#x27;t have any significance.</p><p id="0afd6642-f7ac-4afb-9f5d-2f2a20b64c96" class="">[....]</p><p id="8cf60a21-2139-4ed2-aa22-2caec8ce2ab5" class="">The God certainly cannot be different from you. It is your projection, it is your shadow. It echoes you and nobody else. That&#x27;s why there are so many gods in the world. The Hindus have a certain idea about God -- the Hindu idea -- it reflects the Hindu mind.</p><p id="1fde131e-074e-4152-bb4b-946dbddce0c9" class="">If you go back into Hindu scriptures you will be surprised. You will not be able to believe what kind of gods Hindus have created -- very sexual. Adultery is very common amongst Hindu gods, and not only do they play their games of adultery in the Hindu paradise, they can&#x27;t even leave the earth alone; they come to the earth too, to rape women, to seduce simple women. They don&#x27;t even leave the wives of the great seers alone. And because they have infinite power they can even appear as the husbands, they can look like the husbands. And the women have no idea who is hiding behind the facade.</p><p id="b2f85ed6-f927-4536-82f3-2217040f3dd5" class="">Who has created these gods? -- it must have been deep down a very sexual mind.</p><p id="dc758ef3-d7d0-4d98-ad31-593549cadc9b" class="">And the same is the case with all other gods of all other religions. It is because of this that Buddha never talked about God. He said: What is the point of talking about God to people who are asleep? They will listen in their sleep. They will dream about whatsoever is said to them, and they will create their own gods -- which will be utterly false, utterly impotent, utterly meaningless. It is better not to have such gods.</p><p id="aba7a9b6-ee3d-47f6-95af-928fd8aea1e5" class="">That&#x27;s why Buddha is not interested in talking about gods. His whole interest is in waking you up.</p><p id="c0b39f2c-68c2-47ae-9736-4d3f521e04d2" class="">[....]</p><p id="60840d83-3682-455f-b189-00cb803eed27" class="">We go on living absolutely inattentive to what is happening around us. Yes, we have become very efficient in doing things. What we are doing, we have become so efficient in doing that we don&#x27;t need any awareness to do it. It has become mechanical, automatic. We function like robots. We are not men yet; we are machines.</p><p id="b72c06dd-279a-46e7-84e9-24cee4f2abd9" class="">That&#x27;s what George Gurdjieff used to say again and again, that man as he exists is a machine. He offended many people, because nobody likes to be called a machine. Machines like to be called gods; then they feel very happy, puffed up. Gurdjieff used to call people machines, and he was right. If you watch yourself you will know how mechanically you behave.</p><p id="908f01d9-4f88-41ad-850a-17730ecc862d" class="">The Russian psychologist Pavlov, and the American psychologist Skinner, are ninety-nine point nine percent right about man: they believe that man is a beautiful machine, that&#x27;s all. There is no soul in him. I say ninety-nine point nine percent they are right; they only miss by a very small margin. In that small margin are the buddhas, the awakened ones. But they can be forgiven, because Pavlov never came across a buddha -- he came across millions of people like you.</p><p id="d2e834a2-c44e-4f0c-a9d9-5ada678a988f" class="">Skinner has been studying men and rats and finds no difference. Rats are simple beings, that&#x27;s all; man is a little more complicated. Man is a highly sophisticated machine, rats are simple machines. It is easier to study rats; that&#x27;s why psychologists go on studying rats. They study rats and they conclude about man -- and their conclusions are almost right. I say &quot;almost,&quot; mind you, because that point one percent is the most important phenomenon that has happened: a Buddha, a Jesus, a Mohammed. These few awakened people are the real men, but where can B.F. Skinner find a buddha? Certainly not in America.</p><p id="fba9091a-c9ab-4c6c-972f-fde995dc9238" class="">[....]</p><p id="b3a10d59-9b19-4a8c-9ee6-3614ab645da8" class="">Man is in a very fallen state. In fact, that is the meaning of the Christian parable of the fall of Adam, his expulsion. But why were Adam and Eve expelled from paradise? They were expelled because they had eaten the fruit of knowledge. They were expelled because they had become minds, and they had lost their consciousness. If you become a mind you lose consciousness -- mind means sleep, mind means noise, mind means mechanicalness.</p><p id="20c165a4-a907-43ba-9c17-aeb8502a86a4" class="">If you become a mind you lose consciousness.

Innocent villagers are far more alert and awake than the professors in the universities and the pundits in the temples. The pundits are nothing but parrots; the academicians in the universities are full of nothing but holy cow dung, full of absolutely meaningless noise -- just minds and no consciousness.</p><p id="40be92fd-9fe1-4885-9b1b-9a592af88aed" class="">People who work with nature -- farmers, gardeners, woodcutters, carpenters, painters -- they are far more alert than the people that function in the universities as deans and vice-chancellors and chancellors.

If the woodcutter comes with an axe in his hand and with the deliberate desire to cut the tree, all the trees that see him coming tremble. Now there are scientific proofs about it; I am not talking poetry, I am talking science when I say this. Now there are instruments to measure whether the tree is happy or unhappy, afraid or unafraid, sad or ecstatic. When the woodcutter comes, all the trees that see him start trembling. They become aware that death is close by. And the woodcutter has not cut any tree yet -- just his coming....</p><p id="0c69d938-1f24-476d-a23b-86bd61d16be0" class="">And one thing more, far more strange: if the woodcutter is simply passing by there with no deliberate idea to cut a tree, then no tree becomes afraid. It is the same woodcutter, with the same axe. It seems that his intention to cut a tree affects the trees. It means that his intention is being understood; it means the very vibe is being decoded by the trees.</p><p id="f0e29da4-c69d-481f-9e94-24a5df743384" class="">And one more significant fact has been observed scientifically: that if you go into the forest and kill an animal, it is not only the animal kingdom around that becomes shaken, but trees also. If you kill a deer, all the deer that are around feel the vibe of murder, become sad; a great trembling arises in them. Suddenly they are afraid for no particular reason at all. They may not have seen the deer being killed, but somehow, in a subtle way, they are affected -- instinctively, intuitively. But it is not only the deer which are affected -- the trees are affected, the parrots are affected, the tigers are affected, the eagles are affected, the grass leaves are affected. Murder has happened, destruction has happened, death has happened -- everything that is around is affected.</p><p id="c128e72b-b6c0-43f0-b308-0f17a2dc2f20" class="">Man seems to be the most asleep....</p><figure id="93578cb1-1b7c-456f-9db9-0771cb395e71" class="image"><a href="https://oshofriends.com/index.php?act=copytrack&amp;mid=talks_on_meditation&amp;document_srl=60994"><img src="https://oshofriends.com/index.php?act=copytrack&amp;mid=talks_on_meditation&amp;document_srl=60994"/></a></figure><p id="67b0be56-ef67-4efe-8e3b-bf8190c6b57f" class="">[Title] : Man is a beautiful machine</p><p id="2e40bdeb-dcca-4145-b39e-3ab85b8dbe66" class="">[Source] : https://oshofriends.com/talks_on_meditation/60994</p></details></li></ul><h1 id="8dfc8e4c-b753-46b9-9170-760d79d5d8e3" class="">Time</h1><p id="566df37b-f41d-432b-bce6-fc1adb1f2259" class="">We have created time, psychological time. We are masters of that inward time that thought has put together. That is why we must understand the nature of time which man has created psychological time as hope, time as achievement. Why have human beings, psychologically, inwardly, created time – time when one will be good; time when one will be free of violence; time to achieve enlightenment; time to achieve some exalted state of mind; time as meditation? When one functions within the realm of that time one is bringing about a contradiction and hence conflict. Psychological time is conflict.</p><p id="a1fcc225-145b-4600-87ba-eaf31e35ec68" class="">It is really a great discovery if one realizes the truth that one is the past, the present and the future; which is time as psychological knowledge. One creates a division between our living in our consciousness and the distant time which is death. That is, one is living with all one’s problems and death is something to be avoided, postponed, put at a great distance which is another fragmentation in one’s life. To observe holistically the whole movement of life is to live both the living and the dying. But one clings to life and avoids death; one does not even talk about it. So not only has one fragmented one’s life, superficially, physically, but also one has separated oneself from death. What is death; is it not part of one’s life? One may be frightened, one may want to avoid death and to prolong living, but always at the end of it there is death.</p><ul id="f5bb64e2-a847-43c2-ade3-8bb9fa6e86e1" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Essence of Time</summary><p id="0fc98f78-c94a-4e28-9388-7ab84f94eb17" class="">Is there such a thing as psychological time, and what does it signify in that context? While we can easily grasp the notions of yesterday, today, and tomorrow in the context of a clock, do psychological time exist, and if it does, what is it, and how does it relate to the concept of transformation, that profound and revolutionary change? To fully grasp the significance of time, we must investigate something beyond the ordinary, something involving a division, a separation, a fragmentation between the observer and the observed. Please, this is no abstract matter, so stay awake and remain lucid. It demands clear thinking, devoid of both agreement and disagreement. A clear mind is required, one that is willing to explore this matter to its depths. Only such a serious mind will uncover the answers, not the mind that engages in philosophical discussions about time.</p><p id="85dea14b-7e0a-4988-8de0-62c2bc77539c" class="">Whenever there&#x27;s an act of will, time becomes entangled. Can time be brought to an end? We are accustomed to thinking in terms of a gradual process: &quot;I will change, I will become better, I should, I must not,&quot; and so on. All these involve time. Essentially, it means that &quot;I will do it in the future.&quot; The very act of will itself is time. The action of &quot;should&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; is time-bound because there is a gap between &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what should be.&quot; Reaching &quot;what should be&quot; necessitates time. Time is involved when you need to travel from here to your home. And when you want to alter &quot;what is,&quot; you think of it in terms of time. Therefore, &quot;should&quot; implies time, which means that after accumulating experience and learning, you act. It&#x27;s not about learning and then acting. So, the time we&#x27;re familiar with, psychological time, involves will - the concepts of &quot;should&quot; and &quot;should not,&quot; &quot;must&quot; and &quot;must not,&quot; which require moving from one point to another, a journey to be covered over time. Consequently, whenever there&#x27;s an act of will, time enters the equation. When you introduce time, other factors come into play, other influences that modify &quot;what should be.&quot; The cause produces the effect, and then the effect becomes the cause.</p><p id="113f1683-8320-4311-9323-d4b5fb72f8c1" class="">As we mentioned earlier, unless we comprehend this question of time, mutation becomes meaningless. Then, we are solely focused on self-improvement, on becoming better, nobler, kinder, and so on - all of which is bound by time. Thus, we realize that whenever knowledge acts as will, time is an integral part of the equation. And when time exists between the doer and the deed, other variables emerge, and as a result, action is never truly complete. If I decide to relinquish something, it implies I will do it tomorrow. What transpires between now and tomorrow? There&#x27;s an interval, and within that gap, other elements, pressures, strains, and circumstances intervene. Thus, &quot;what should be&quot; is already altered, and so is my action. Consequently, the action remains incomplete. I commence with the intention of doing something tomorrow, internally - renouncing, conforming, imitating, and the like - and there are other factors, pressures, strains, and circumstances that interfere. Due to habit, tradition, and the accumulation of technological knowledge, we&#x27;ve developed the habit of telling ourselves, &quot;I&#x27;ll do it another day,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll change gradually.&quot; This idea of gradualness, once again, involves time, and it entangles the whole process of modification. Therefore, we must delve much deeper into the nature of time.</p><p id="b9bb425c-4241-41c4-b5d5-5d3d5660b1cd" class="">If there were no tomorrow, there would be an immense revolution inwardly. We observe chronological time. We perceive time as will in action. We also understand that the mind, through its inertia and idleness, has invented time as a means to postpone action, both in thought and in practice. There&#x27;s the idea grounded in organized thought, tradition, knowledge, and information. According to this idea, there is action, which is steeped in gradualness. But is there time at all? If we can fathom this or discover an end to time, then immediate action ensues. The mind ceases to be indolent; it lacks the energy for idleness. If we were aware of imminent death tomorrow, we would act immediately. Therefore, we must set aside the superficial explanation of time. Does time even exist? If there&#x27;s no conclusion to time, then freedom and the end of sorrow become distant ideals. Life then becomes merely a series of reactions and responses. So, can we put an end to time? If the mind can uncover it, apprehend it, then action takes on an entirely new significance.</p><p id="b801e2ff-15d7-4307-abb8-e7baa5380fc6" class="">Imagine if your house were on fire; you wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here! If you were informed that there&#x27;s no tomorrow, you&#x27;d be horrified! While there exists chronological tomorrow, there is no psychological tomorrow. If there&#x27;s no tomorrow, it ushers in a profound inward revolution. Love, action, beauty, space, and freedom assume entirely different meanings. This is what we&#x27;re on the verge of discovering. It&#x27;s a discovery, not an acquisition of knowledge that you either agree or disagree with. You will experience it, feel your way into it, and it will liberate you from time.</p><p id="0b001a91-b14c-4114-9be7-25b0e2d20712" class="">Time, as we measure it by a clock, is an undeniable reality. Time, as it manifests through will in action, is also a reality. We also understand time as a gradual process when we say, &quot;I&#x27;ll do it tomorrow, that&#x27;s good enough.&quot; Now, is there a time beyond these realities? To explore this, not just theoretically, intellectually, or emotionally, but to genuinely feel it within, we must delve into the relationship between the observer and the observed. When you observe a sunset, there&#x27;s an observer and the observed, creating a division between the two. This division represents time. The observer is not a permanent entity. Don&#x27;t assert that the observer existed first. Allow me to caution you here. Approach this as if you&#x27;ve never read any sacred texts. Approach it as if you&#x27;re witnessing it for the very first time. Don&#x27;t interpret what someone else has said, claiming the existence of an original observer, an original entity, a silent observer. You can generate many words and theories, but avoid this, for it will obscure the essence.</p><p id="508d30f6-bc8e-46f1-b36d-e11235a17e51" class="">As you gaze upon anything - a tree, your spouse, your children, your neighbor, the stars at night, the light shimmering on water, a bird in the sky, anything - there&#x27;s always an observer, a judge, a censor, an experiencer, a seeker, and the thing observed; the observer and the observed, the thinker and the thought. Thus, there is always division. This division is time. The observer is never a permanent entity. This is a significant point. Because as long as there&#x27;s division, time inevitably persists. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the observer should identify itself with the observed, as such an identification also involves time.</p><p id="d01ef43d-36b3-4393-85c9-2e61bde2d4f8" class="">Love transcends time. Therefore, when we understand the nature of time, particularly the involvement of time in will, immediate action becomes possible. This immediate action means the end of sorrow, not tomorrow, but today. To truly comprehend time, we must also grasp the concepts of space and beauty. Beauty is not a stimulus; it doesn&#x27;t arise from architecture, paintings, sunsets, or beautiful faces. Beauty is something entirely distinct. It can only be apprehended when the experi</p><p id="a5f354eb-3ac0-43d9-8551-5dc23387c31f" class="">encer is absent, and consequently, experience ceases to exist. Love is analogous to this; the moment you say you love, love ceases to exist, as it transforms into mere thought, sentiment, emotion, contaminated by jealousy, hatred, envy, and greed. Therefore, one must explore the nature of time, not merely as a theoretical or intellectual exercise, but as a direct inward experience. Through this understanding, immediate action becomes possible, and with it, the end of sorrow.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="cef060a5-417e-46f0-a554-2156f6181c0c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Delusion of Time</summary><p id="07f2fb9d-803e-43ec-9d5b-114d9b409b23" class="">Here is the key: End the delusion of time.

Firstly, because it is the <em>only </em>thing. It&#x27;s all there is. The eternal present is the space within which your whole life unfolds, the one factor that remains <em>constant.

It is fairly simple to understand it intellectually, but to see the meaning of it, to understand the nature of time, the significance of time, the depth of time, we must not only understand chronological time by the watch in our pocket or on our wrist, but also we must understand and observe the psychological thing which creates time as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Time is a movement, a total thing, and if we break it up into yesterday, today and tomorrow we are caught in the bondage of time. Then we develop theories of gradualism, or of immediacy, the ‘now’. There is the gradual theory, that gradually human beings will become more benevolent, more kind, more this and more that. We see the utter hopelessness of dependence upon a future life, the future being the tomorrow, upon the gain that will take place in a few months, years or centuries. That again is a fragmentation of time. In all that we are caught, and therefore we do not understand the extraordinary movement of time without fragmentation. There is actually only time by the watch and no other time. That train goes by precisely at this time every day, and if you would catch it you must be at the station at the time it leaves. Otherwise you will miss it. Chronological time has to be observed exactly. The observation of time by the watch is not a contradiction, is not a fragmentation of that other time.</p><p id="0fd08a69-7b26-4621-a85b-1aab38643c44" class="">Time which is not of the watch is invented by memory, by experience or by the centre that says, “I will be something”. There is the question of death and its postponement by avoiding it, pushing it away. Thought makes for the fragmentation of time which, except chronological time, does not actually exist. We do not understand that extraordinary movement of time in which there is no fragmentation, because we are always thinking of what I was, what I am and what I will be. All that is the fragmentation of psychological time, and you cannot do anything about it, except listen. You cannot say, “I will get rid of time and live in the present because it is only the present that matters”. Actually, what does ‘the present’ mean? The present is only the result of the past, but there is an actual present if there is no fragmentation of time. I hope you see the beauty of this.</p><p id="c145abe9-12a7-4345-b6e6-4ddf464cdc4c" class="">Time for us becomes of enormous importance, not chronological time, not going to the office every day, taking the train, the bus, keeping an appointment. All that is very trivial. We have to do it, but what is important is psychological time, which we break up into yesterday, today and tomorrow. We are always living in the past. ‘Now’ is the past, because the ‘now’ is the continuation of memory, the recognition of what has been, which cannot be altered, and what is going on at the present time. Either we live in the memory of youth, in the remembrance of things that have been, or we live in the image of tomorrow. We live lives of gradual decay, of gradual withering. With the coming on of senility, the brain cells become weaker and weaker, lose all their energy, vitality and force. Therein lies the great sorrow. As we grow older, memory disappears and we become senile, which is the repetition of what has been. That is how we are living. Though we are very active, we are senile. In the present, in the moment of action we are always living in the past, with its influence, its pressures, its strain, its vitality. All the knowledge which we have acquired and stored up through enormous struggle, through time, is knowledge of the past. Knowledge can never be of the present. From that past knowledge we act, and that action is what we call ‘the present’. That action is always engendering decay.</p><p id="adc3a41f-b356-4242-8889-9d3e0a6ddbfd" class="">We are acting in the image, in the symbol, in the idea of the past; and that is the fragmentation of life. We invent philosophies, theories of the present; we live only in the present and make the best of it. Nothing else matters. Such living in the present is a despair, because time which has been divided into the past, the present and the future only brings about despair. Knowing despair, we say, “It doesn’t matter; let’s try and live in the now, in the present, because everything is meaningless. All action, all life, all existence, all relationship, everything must end in the division of time and therefore in despair, in decay, in trouble”. Please do listen, because we can’t do anything about it. That is the beauty of what will take place if we do nothing but listen. This doesn’t mean that we are going to accept what is being said; there is neither acceptance nor denial. It is stupid for anyone to say, “I am living in the present”. It doesn’t mean a thing. It is equally stupid to say, “I deny the past”. We can deny the past, but we are the result of the past. Our whole functioning is from the past. Our beliefs, our dogmas, our symbols, the particular line we are trying to follow, whatever it is, is still the result of the past, which is time. We have broken up time into the past, the present and the future. This naturally breeds fear, fear of life which is not of time, and the movement of time which is not broken up into yesterday, today and tomorrow. That movement of time can be perceived totally only when there is no fragmentation, when there is no centre from which we look at life.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="18daa832-ecea-49c0-994a-f6a573e5c816" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Letting go of Psychological time</summary><p id="c99e98ea-fe36-470d-9bf8-10e5866d5b11" class="">Learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life -- we may call this &quot;clock time&quot; -- but immediately return to present-moment awareness when those practical matters have been dealt with.

On the other hand, if you dwell on it mentally, and self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up, then you are making the mistake into &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;: you make it part of your sense of self, and it has become psychological time, which is always linked to a false sense of identity.

If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your life&#x27;s journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to &quot;make it.&quot; You no longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are present in the Now.</p><p id="76da18ff-3fd8-4edc-b009-dfd8c92b4b9e" class="">When I say &quot;time is an illusion,&quot; my intention is not to make a philosophical statement.

They occur, for example, in the form of ideologies such as communism, national socialism or any nationalism, or rigid religious belief systems, which operate under the implicit assumption that the highest good lies in the future and that therefore the end justifies the means. The end is an idea, a point in the mind-projected future, when salvation in whatever form -- happiness, fulfillment, equality, liberation, and so on -- will be attained. Not infrequently, the means of getting there are the enslavement, torture, and murder of people in the present.</p><p id="2c81c798-3f2a-4afa-96f0-ad9cf75f9f47" class="">For example, it is estimated that as many as 50 million people were murdered to further the cause of communism, to bring about a &quot;better world&quot; in Russia, China, and other countries.

Are you always focused on becoming, achieving, and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or pleasure? Do you believe that if you acquire more things you will become more fulfilled, good enough, or psychologically complete?

The ceaseless river of sorrow and suffering, rooted in time, persists as long as we remain ensnared within its currents. However, within the act of ending attachment and possession lies the doorway to an entirely distinct dimension, one that transcends the confines of both beginning and ending, a realm that is inherently timeless. To comprehend this timeless existence, one must live it, experiencing its profound transformation. It necessitates the relinquishment of attachment today, not in some distant tomorrow. Attachment and possession offer a fleeting pleasure that conceals a myriad of implications, such as the fear of loss, the dread of tomorrow&#x27;s change, jealousy, anxiety, and hatred. Recognizing this complex web and choosing to instantly sever its hold signifies a profound act of liberation, leading to the emergence of an eternal dimension where neither beginning nor ending prevails – a realm of pure eternity.</p><p id="91e1695d-ab65-42cd-8822-6d8bcda305bc" class="">Time, that peculiar phenomenon, holds different meanings for each of us, tailored to our individual perspectives and needs. To a scientist, time is an abstract concept; to the layperson, it becomes a practical measure. For a historian, it is a lens into the past, while for a stock market enthusiast, it transforms into a ticking clock of opportunity. In the heart of a mother, time intertwines with the memories of her child, and for the weary soul, it represents respite in the shade. Time, flexible and ever-adapting, often conforms to our desires and cunning minds. Yet, in our daily existence, can we truly discern psychological time from the straightforward chronology of the clock? Does psychological time indeed hold any substance, or is it merely a construct of our own minds? In essence, does anything exist beyond chronological time?</p><p id="7ae157a1-9122-4877-bea0-ce11efa5a1c2" class="">While chronological time remains an indispensable component of our lives, the same cannot be said for its psychological counterpart. The concept of cause and effect, a time-bound process, extends its influence not only in the physical realm but also within the psyche. It is commonly assumed that an interval separates cause from effect, manifesting as time. Yet, is there truly a gap between psychological cause and effect, or do they constitute an inseparable, continuous whole? The act of becoming, a process deeply entwined with time, is called into question. It relies on the assumption that transformation requires time. &quot;I am this, and I shall become that&quot; embodies this notion. However, becoming, in this sense, seems to be a fallacy. Ignorance can never become wisdom, just as greed can never transform into non-greed. The process itself embodies the very essence of ignorance.</p><p id="4ef562ff-0369-43ba-bd8f-588e0048dcb3" class="">Thought, the offspring of time, shapes our consciousness. It perpetually resides in the past, forever tethered to prior experiences and memories. Knowledge, a product of this time-bound thought, is intrinsically tied to the past. It exists solely within the framework of time, a prisoner of its continuity. This continuum of memory and knowledge gives birth to consciousness. Experience, too, resides in the past, forming an inseparable union with it. This past, when coupled with the present, propels us towards the future. The future, in essence, remains an extension of the past, albeit possibly modified. The entirety of this process, from experience to memory to knowledge, revolves around thought, a construct inherently bound by time. While thought may venture into the realm of the timeless through speculation, it inevitably becomes a projection of itself. Speculation, in its essence, is a manifestation of ignorance.</p><p id="cbcdbcaf-ac1a-4a8d-abae-548c52a08fb4" class="">Recognition presupposes an experiencer, and the experiencer invariably dwells within the confines of time. To recognize something, thought must have previously experienced it. However, once experienced, it transforms into the known, firmly grounded within the realm of time. The timeless remains unattainable through thought, as it cannot be grasped as a new acquisition or achievement. It defies the concept of progression. The timeless is a state of being where thought, synonymous with time, ceases to exist.</p><p id="abfa1fa6-a33f-4311-9996-a95925884df4" class="">The timeless holds no tangible value or marketability. It cannot be quantified or harnessed for specific purposes. Its worth remains shrouded in mystery. In the grand tapestry of life, it plays no role that can be conveniently assigned. It does not serve as a source of peace, happiness, or a shield against life&#x27;s tribulations. Attempts to utilize it for any purpose inevitably fail, as the timeless remains beyond the grasp of thought. Life, when bound by time, begets sorrow, conflict, and pain. Thought, the very essence of the problem, cannot provide solutions to the human predicament. The cessation of knowledge heralds the dawn of wisdom, which exists outside the realm of time. Life, when touched by the timeless, blooms into bliss.</p><p id="3c6bebd1-4166-4359-8998-25033990bfc4" class="">In our eternal quest to understand the interplay of time and the timeless, we embark on a journey where thought is not our guide. The timeless can only be lived, not thought or articulated, for it lies beyond the reach of mental constructs. In this exploration, we begin to glimpse a reality where time and its constraints fade away, leaving behind an eternal presence that defies definition and transforms existence itself.</p><p id="1a05e075-ea3c-42e9-9865-258b2263ef30" class="">Let us delve into the concept of time, as understanding time in its entirety is crucial to appreciating the timeless, the true, and the enriching aspects of life. We all seek happiness and fulfillment in our unique ways, but a life of true significance and boundless happiness transcends the limitations of time. Like love, such a life exists beyond the constraints of time. To grasp the timeless, we must not approach it through the lens of time but rather comprehend the essence of time itself. Our tendency to employ time as a means to attain or apprehend the timeless is a common mistake in our lives.</p><p id="abdcbaa1-818d-4ab9-8bad-a87eaf662f70" class="">Our existence primarily unfolds within the realm of time, not merely as a chronological sequence of minutes, hours, days, and years but as a product of psychological memory. Our minds are the products of accumulated yesterdays, and the present becomes a bridge between the past and the future. Our very being is deeply rooted in time; we cannot think without it because thought is a child of time, a product of our past experiences and memories. Memory is intrinsic to time, and there are two facets of time: chronological and psychological. While we cannot dismiss chronological time, it is essential to question the existence of psychological time beyond the constructs of the mind.</p><p id="7b481973-dc27-40ab-a774-6d18055634aa" class="">Psychological time is a creation of the mind itself. Devoid of thought, there is no psychological time, as it relies on the foundation of memory and the interplay between yesterday&#x27;s experiences, today&#x27;s responses, and the formation of tomorrow. The process of thought perpetuates psychological progression in time. However, the reality of psychological time may not be as tangible as chronological time. Can we harness the time of the mind as a means to comprehend the timeless, especially when our minds continuously strive to grasp that which transcends time?</p><p id="d1907309-a12c-494b-94cf-9dfc3a43da14" class="">Happiness is not a product of yesterday, nor does it adhere to the rules of time. It resides solely in the present, existing in a timeless state. Have you ever noticed that moments of ecstasy or creative joy are devoid of time? In such instances, only the immediate present exists. However, the mind, seeking to prolong these moments, clings to memories and strives to accumulate more of them, thereby creating time. Time becomes synonymous with accumulation and detachment, both products of the mind. Therefore, attempting to discipline the mind within the framework of time and conditioning thought in the realm of memory does not unveil the timeless.</p><p id="aea993ec-1cf2-445e-98a4-291866738fb1" class="">Our lives frequently blur the distinction between chronological and psychological time. We equate chronological time with the psychological time of our psyche and employ this mindset in our quest for self-improvement, realization, and attainment. But is there a genuine concept of &quot;becoming&quot; in terms of discovering reality, divinity, or happiness? Can we utilize time as a means to reach the timeless, even if the means themselves are flawed? The means and the end are inseparable; employing the wrong means, which is time, to achieve the right end, which is the timeless, will invariably lead to an incorrect outcome.</p><p id="0584cf65-ca95-4921-8f97-bdcfff4d69ea" class="">Chronological time and the time of the mind become entangled in our thinking, and we often mistakenly employ the chronological mentality to seek psychological progression. This process of &quot;becoming&quot; is inherently tied to time, and it raises questions about whether such a journey is even valid. Can time, as a means of &quot;becoming,&quot; truly lead to the timeless? To access the timeless, time itself must come to a halt, necessitating the cessation of the entire thought process. Surprisingly, this isn&#x27;t as challenging as it initially appears, as moments of profound stillness do occur in our lives.</p><p id="fdef3c55-f9dc-4523-a709-24289ecd9720" class="">The cessation of thought and the experience of the timeless require an understanding of memory. Thought relies on memory, and without memory, there is no thought. Memory is intricately linked to time, and without memory, time ceases to exist. Memory essentially represents incomplete experiences. A fully experienced moment lacks any trace of memory; during the experience itself, there is no memory, no division between the observer and the observed, and no awareness of time. It&#x27;s only when the experience transforms into a memory that time intrudes. Most of us exist on the basis of our memories, whether personal or imparted by others. Thus, comprehending the psychological operation of memory is vital. This understanding leads to self-knowledge, as it unveils our relationship with everything around us, including nature, people, possessions, and ideas. It is through these relationships that memory is exposed, and comprehending this process of self reveals self-knowledge. Without grasping the essence of self at any level, we cannot break free from memory&#x27;s grip. Consequently, we remain bound by time, and the timeless remains elusive.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="c3b198a9-0a00-44e4-acdb-be3c8a640881" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Negativity and Suffering have their roots in time</summary><p id="355f0b08-a586-49c2-901d-c4eb9fd93432" class="">Usually, the future is a replica of the past. Superficial changes are possible, but <em>real </em>transformation is rare and depends upon whether you can become present enough to dissolve the past by accessing the power of the Now. What you perceive as future is an intrinsic part of your state of consciousness now. If your mind carries a heavy burden of past, you will experience more of the same. The past perpetuates itself through lack of presence.

You believe that they are caused by specific situations in your life, and seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true. But until you have dealt with the basic problem-making dysfunction of the mind -- its attachment to past and future and denial of the Now -- problems are actually interchangeable. If all your problems or perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for you today, but you had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon find yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, like a shadow that follows you wherever you go.

What is the timeless, the essence of creativity you&#x27;ve spoken of?&quot; Is it feasible to be conscious of the timeless? How can we ascertain whether we truly know or are aware of it?

Even if we comprehend the concept of time, is it plausible to discuss the nature of the timeless? Even if both of us possess awareness of it, can it be articulated? We may engage in conversation about it, yet our experience will never capture the essence of timelessness. It can never be expressed or communicated except through the medium of time, but it&#x27;s crucial to remember that the word itself is distinct from the concept it represents. The timeless can&#x27;t be comprehended through the lens of time. Timelessness is a state that emerges only when time itself is absent. So, let&#x27;s instead explore our understanding of time.</p><p id="f827cac7-d801-42d4-89ec-44ea23c4d275" class="">&quot;There are various types of time: time as growth, time as distance, time as motion.&quot; Time manifests chronologically and psychologically. Time as growth illustrates the progression from small to large, from the bullock cart to the jet plane, from infancy to adulthood. Growth is evident in both the heavens and on Earth, and denying this fact would be foolish.</p><p id="f56c4d7a-bde6-4e53-aa4c-a90a04d6e98d" class="">&quot;Experiencing something new implies the absence of the old.&quot; When we consider yesterday as a bridge to tomorrow, with the past flowing through the present into the future, it constitutes a singular temporal flow, not three distinct movements. We perceive time as both chronological and psychological, as indicative of growth and becoming. The process of growth is relatively straightforward, so let&#x27;s set it aside for now. Psychological becoming, on the other hand, is intrinsically linked with time. It entails the concept of &quot;I am this now, and I shall become that in the future,&quot; utilizing time as a conduit or means of transition. We are intimately familiar with this process. Therefore, thought is inherently connected to time; it encompasses thoughts of the past and the anticipation of the future, the &quot;what is&quot; and the ideal. Thought is a product of time, and without the process of thought, time loses its significance. The mind is the creator of time; it is time itself.</p><p id="2f2156f4-b27c-45ca-98a3-a45000611016" class="">&quot;That&#x27;s accurate. The mind is both the creator and user of time. In the absence of mental processes, time ceases to exist. But is it possible to transcend the mind? Is there a state beyond thought?&quot; Let&#x27;s jointly explore whether such a state exists. Is love a product of thought? We may think of someone we love; when that person is absent, we think of them or possess an image or photograph. The absence of the beloved gives rise to thoughts.</p><p id="f5959aa0-ddc3-4ab2-b971-6312f0baa6da" class="">&quot;Do you mean that when there is unity, thought dissipates, leaving only love?&quot; Unity implies duality, but that&#x27;s not the central point. Is love a process of thought? Thought is intertwined with time, so does love also bind itself to time? Thought is entangled in the constraints of time, and you&#x27;re inquiring whether it&#x27;s feasible to liberate oneself from these temporal restrictions.</p><p id="1c46c233-6b26-42d6-96cd-cd507acd29ca" class="">&quot;It must be possible. Otherwise, there could be no creation. Creation can only occur when the continuum ceases. Creation embodies novelty, fresh perspectives, new inventions, discoveries, and formulations, rather than perpetuating the old.&quot; Continuity stifles creativity.</p><p id="9dc9f123-e571-488e-b87a-48ddb25bb780" class="">&quot;But how can we put an end to continuity?&quot; What precisely is continuity? What sustains it? What connects one moment to the next, akin to a thread stringing together beads on a necklace? Each moment represents the new, yet the new becomes absorbed into the old, thus forming the chain of continuity. Does the new truly exist, or is it merely recognized by the old? If the old recognizes the new, can it genuinely be considered new? The old can only perceive its own projections; it may label them as new, but they aren&#x27;t. The new is beyond recognition; it exists in a state devoid of familiarity or association. The old maintains its continuity by projecting itself; it can never truly apprehend the new. The new may be translated into the language of the old, but it cannot coexist with the old. Experiencing the new necessitates the absence of the old. The act of experiencing and its subsequent expression is thought and idea; thought translates the new into terms of the old. Continuity arises from the old, which is comprised of memory and words—both bound by time.</p><p id="5750da0e-6fa5-4f1b-9f31-93947498f37e" class="">&quot;How can we possibly break free from memory?&quot; Is it even feasible? The entity that aspires to break free from memory is itself the creator of memory; it is inseparable from memory. Isn&#x27;t that the case?</p><p id="dd2d9cc7-c068-4ce7-9ff1-2164514425be" class="">&quot;Yes, the entity making the effort is born of memory and thought. Thought is the result of the past, whether conscious or unconscious. So, what should one do?&quot; Please listen attentively, and you will naturally, without exertion, undertake what is essential. Desire is a product of thought; desire forges the links of memory. Desire involves effort and acts of will. Accumulation is driven by desire; to accumulate is to perpetuate. Amassing experiences, knowledge, power, or possessions fosters continuity, while renouncing them results in a negative form of continuity. Positive and negative continuity are analogous. The focal point of accumulation is desire, which may exist at various levels based on one&#x27;s conditioning. Any action stemming from this focal point only perpetuates itself. Any movement is an entanglement in time, hindering the potential for creation. Timelessness cannot coexist with the time-binding nature of memory. The boundless cannot be measured through memory or experience. The unnamable emerges only when experience and knowledge have completely ceased. Truth alone releases the mind from its self-imposed shackles.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="164aca8c-737d-44c5-9c80-97dca546b12f" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Time and Meditation</summary><p id="0dda0902-7c08-4725-b669-5b5e1cc82428" class="">In the practice of meditation, the quest is to discern whether there exists something, or perhaps nothing, that is eternal and timeless. This contemplation beckons us to ponder whether the mind, deeply ingrained in the realm of time, can ever apprehend or glimpse that which endures from infinity to infinity. Can the mind, so entwined with time, shed its temporal nature? Can it relinquish the past, the present, and the future? Can it dwell in absolute nothingness? Do not be daunted by the word &quot;nothingness.&quot; Consider an empty cup before coffee fills it; have you ever contemplated its emptiness? This emptiness permits reception; it creates space. Now, consider your own mind - does it contain any space at all? A pure, uncluttered space or is it cluttered with concerns, desires, achievements, knowledge, ambitions, fears, anxieties, and trivialities? How can such a cluttered mind ever contain space?</p><p id="4be96991-54e4-480d-834a-fd443035858d" class="">Space is inherently vast; comprehend this notion. A mind devoid of space in its everyday existence cannot possibly encounter the eternal and the timeless. This is why meditation holds profound significance. Not the meditation you currently practice, which is scarcely meditation at all. We speak of a meditation that transmutes the mind, and only such a mind is truly religious. A religious mind can usher in a new culture, a new way of life, a new form of relationship, imbued with a sense of the sacred, thereby fostering great beauty and honesty. All this unfolds naturally, devoid of struggle, sacrifice, or control. This marks both the commencement and culmination of meditation.</p><p id="1811bf4d-741a-4dd5-9c8a-f5fe39282c2f" class="">It is remarkable how readily one accepts such a predicament without truly comprehending it. Without experiencing the breath, fragrance, and beauty of such a mind, one inquires about its functionality in a world governed by time. Together, we must endeavor to construct a new world. Together. Consequently, one must possess such a mind – not another, for they are of no significance. What holds importance is your attainment of such a mind. Only then will one unravel the means to operate and lead a life in a world of temporal constraints with a mind that is inherently religious. First and foremost, bring order into your life; be cognizant of the disorder that permeates your existence. Recognize the contradictions that persist – saying one thing, doing another, thinking one way while professing another. Confront the dishonesty and unscrupulous manner in which you live while speaking of divinity, participating in ceremonies, yet dwelling in corruption. To acknowledge this disorder is to instill order into your life. Without order in your daily existence, meditation remains futile. You cannot grasp that which is nameless and timeless, the very essence of beauty and love, if your daily life lacks order, beauty, or love.</p></details></li></ul><h1 id="b12faf1a-343d-4957-a61b-d55173aa7da9" class="">Consciousness</h1><ul id="313c4373-af32-4092-aa2c-43108d78754c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Conscious Death</summary><p id="2292c3f1-9655-4766-97b6-faa628a97d35" class="">Apart from dreamless sleep, which I mentioned already, there is one other</p><p id="43c6c690-8298-4f96-a690-10f36a2fc21c" class="">involuntary portal.

Many of them also spoke of a sense of blissful serenity and deep peace. In the <em>Tibetan Book of the Dead, </em>it is described as &quot;the luminous splendor of the colorless light of Emptiness,&quot; which it says is &quot;your own true self.&quot; This portal opens up only very briefly, and unless you have already encountered the dimension of the Unmanifested in your lifetime, you will likely miss it. Most people carry too much residual resistance, too much fear, too much attachment to sensory experience, too much identification with the manifested world. So they see the portal, turn away in fear, and then lose consciousness. Most of what happens after that is involuntary and automatic. Eventually, there will be another round of birth and death. Their presence wasn&#x27;t strong enough yet for conscious immortality.</p><p id="b5d35938-9769-4771-8759-fc0d915180c3" class=""><em>So going through this portal does not mean annihilation?</em></p><p id="5d051de4-1c16-4676-a57f-d0fee3657711" class="">As with all the other portals, your radiant true nature remains, but not the personality. In any case, whatever is real or of true value in your personality is your true nature shining through. This is never lost. Nothing that is of value, nothing that is <em>real, </em>is ever lost.</p><p id="5acdfa34-aac7-435c-b16d-49a361f978b8" class="">Approaching death and death itself, the dissolution of the physical form, is always a great opportunity for spiritual realization.

When you go through it, you cease to derive your identity from your psychological, mind- made form. You then realize that death is an illusion, just as your identification with form was an illusion. The end of illusion -- that&#x27;s all that death is. It is painful only as long as you cling to illusion.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="3104b63a-2663-4f22-b797-f0b241982de2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Inner Space Consciousness</summary><p id="30073aec-cee4-4eef-a97b-e9706e92a284" class="">Whenever there is beauty, kindness, the recognition of the goodness of simple things in your life, look for the background to that experience within yourself. But don’t look for it as if you were looking for something. You cannot pin it down and say, “Now I have it,” or grasp it mentally and define it in some way. It is like the cloudless sky. It has no form. It is space; it is stillness, the sweetness of Being and infinitely more than these words, which are only pointers. When you are able to sense it directly within yourself, it deepens. So when you appreciate something simple — a sound, a sight, a touch — when you see beauty, when you feel loving kindness toward another, sense the inner spaciousness that is the source and background to that experience.</p><p id="6798e438-1517-48fd-866e-bbd097d8906b" class="">Many poets and sages throughout the ages have observed that true happiness — I call it the joy of Being — is found in simple, seemingly unremarkable things. Most people, in their restless search for something significant to happen to them, continuously miss the insignificant, which may not be insignificant at all. The philosopher Nietzsche, in a rare moment of deep stillness, wrote, “For happiness, how little suffices for happiness! . . . the least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest thing, a lizard’s rustling, a breath, a wisk, an eye glance — little maketh up the best happiness. Be still.” Why is it the “least thing” that makes up “the best happiness”? Because true happiness is not caused by the thing or event, although this is how it first appears. The thing or event is so subtle, so unobtrusive, that it takes up only a small part of your consciousness—and the rest is inner space, consciousness itself unobstructed by form.</p><p id="0f106d57-24bb-4538-83ab-acba880e1fbc" class="">Inner space consciousness and who you are in your essence are one and the same. In other words, the form of little things leaves room for inner space. And it is from inner space, the unconditioned consciousness itself, that true happiness, the joy of Being, emanates. To be aware of little, quiet things, however, you need to be quiet inside. A high degree of alertness is required. Be still. Look. Listen. Be present.</p><p id="4bc14adc-a729-4a02-a45f-dc0c4aa5fe93" class="">Here is another way of finding inner space: Become conscious of being conscious. Say or think “I Am” and add nothing to it. Be aware of the stillness that follows the I Am. Sense your presence, the naked, unveiled, unclothed beingness. It is untouched by young or old, rich or poor, good or bad, or any other attributes. It is the spacious womb of all creation, all form.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="aa1e0af2-1779-40be-842b-57b1e0a979f1" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Different Levels of Consciousness</summary><p id="c3d01756-3b14-42e9-abef-20caa07d0569" class="">As you probably know, in sleep you constantly move between the phases of dreamless sleep and the dream state. Similarly, in wakefulness most people only shift between ordinary unconsciousness and deep unconsciousness. What I call ordinary unconsciousness means being identified with your thought processes and emotions, your reactions, desires, and aversions. It is most people&#x27;s normal state. In that state, you are run by the egoic mind, and you are unaware of Being. It is a state not of acute pain or unhappiness but of an almost continuous low level of unease, discontent, boredom, or nervousness <strong>-- </strong>a kind of background static. You may not realize this because it is so much a part of &quot;normal&quot; living, just as you are not aware of a continuous low background noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner, until it stops. When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many people use alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work, television, or even shopping as anesthetics in an unconscious attempt to remove the basic unease. When this happens, an activity that might be very enjoyable if used in moderation becomes imbued with a compulsive or addictive quality, and all that is ever achieved through it is extremely short-lived symptom relief.</p><p id="92f62ed9-2ebd-4596-955b-8f2643951909" class="">The unease of ordinary unconsciousness turns into the pain of deep unconsciousness -- a state of more acute and more obvious suffering or unhappiness -- when things &quot;go wrong,&quot; when the ego is threatened or there is a major challenge, threat, or loss, real or imagined, in your life situation or conflict in a relationship. It is an intensified version of ordinary unconsciousness, different from it not in kind but in degree.</p><p id="ee667c0e-3dca-4df0-b573-c520f8cdfddc" class="">In ordinary unconsciousness, habitual resistance to or denial of what <em>is </em>creates the unease and discontent that most people accept as normal living. When this resistance becomes intensified through some challenge or threat to the ego, it brings up intense negativity such as anger, acute fear, aggression, depression, and so on. Deep unconsciousness often means that the pain-body has been triggered and that you have become identified with it. Physical violence would be impossible without deep unconsciousness. It can also occur easily whenever and wherever a crowd of people or even an entire nation generates a negative collective energy field.</p><p id="81360b16-11ad-428e-9b85-3539c962080f" class="">The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you deal with life&#x27;s challenges when they come. Through those challenges, an already unconscious person tends to become more deeply unconscious, and a conscious person more intensely conscious. You can use a challenge to awaken you, or you can allow it to pull you into even deeper sleep. The dream of ordinary unconsciousness then turns into a nightmare.</p><p id="4558118e-3a7d-471f-950b-db2cb9bb1112" class="">If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such as when you are sitting alone in a room, walking in the woods, or listening to someone, then you certainly won&#x27;t be able to stay conscious when something &quot;goes wrong&quot; or you are faced with difficult people or situations, with loss or the threat of loss. You will be taken over by a reaction, which ultimately is always some form of fear, and pulled into deep unconsciousness. Those challenges are your tests. Only the way in which you deal with them will show you and others where you are at as far as your state of consciousness is concerned, not how long you can sit with your eyes closed or what visions you see.</p><p id="8bc27b12-cc5f-48bc-af31-99e15f6f6e4a" class="">So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life in ordinary situations when everything is going relatively smoothly. In this way, you grow in presence power. It generates an energy field in you and around you of a high vibrational frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no discord or violence can enter that field and survive, just as darkness cannot survive in the presence of light.</p><p id="150faeb2-ae4c-4ae3-97e8-87cbcf57d60f" class="">When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and emotions, which is an essential part of being present, you may be surprised when you first become aware of the background &quot;static&quot; of ordinary unconsciousness and realize how rarely, if ever, you are truly at ease within yourself On the level of your thinking, you will find a great deal of resistance in the form of judgment, discontent, and mental projection away from the Now. On the emotional level, there will be an undercurrent of unease, tension, boredom, or nervousness. Both are aspects of the mind in its habitual resistance mode.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="d08d2924-ddb5-4a85-aad8-ff3318c6ada0" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Dissolving Ordinary Consciousness</summary><p id="99a4a0cc-4196-4de9-bacb-57a2ef8f0cc9" class="">Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, discontent, and tension arise within you through unnecessary judgment, resistance to what <em>is, </em>and denial of the Now. Anything unconscious dissolves when you shine the light of consciousness on it. Once you know how to dissolve ordinary unconsciousness, the light of your presence will shine brightly, and it will be much easier to deal with deep unconsciousness whenever you feel its gravitational pull. However, ordinary unconsciousness may not be easy to detect initially because it is so normal.</p><p id="9cf19162-699b-4f12-a222-d6d6681219d9" class="">Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation. &quot;Am I at ease at this moment?&quot; is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or you can ask: &quot;What&#x27;s going on inside me at this moment?&quot; Be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. But don&#x27;t answer these questions immediately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you detect that there is a low level of unease, the background static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or denying life -- by denying the Now. There are many ways in which people unconsciously resist the present moment. I will give you a few examples. With practice, your power of self-observation, of monitoring your inner state, will become sharpened.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="63560d6a-f37c-455d-b796-229fd1960d04" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Realising pure consciousness</summary><p id="0901e677-3f03-4632-a763-797df4d25a24" class="">When you become conscious of Being, what is really happening is that Being becomes conscious of itself. When Being becomes conscious of itself-- that&#x27;s presence. Since Being, consciousness, and life are synonymous, we could say that presence means consciousness becoming conscious of itself, or life attaining self-consciousness. But don&#x27;t get attached to the words, and don&#x27;t make an effort to understand this. There is nothing that you need to understand before you can become present.</p><p id="0311dd0a-f96e-4896-8a92-10492ed23653" class=""> In the Bible, God declares: &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, and I am the living One.&quot; In the timeless realm where God dwells, which is also your home, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, are one, and the essence of everything that ever has been and ever will be is eternally present in an unmanifested state of oneness and perfection -- totally beyond anything the human mind can ever imagine or comprehend. In our world of seemingly separate forms, however, timeless perfection is an inconceivable concept. Here even consciousness, which is the light emanating from the eternal Source, seems to be subject to a process of development, but this is due to our limited perception. It is not so in absolute terms. Nevertheless, let me continue to speak for a moment about the evolution of consciousness in this world.</p><p id="ad624dac-89b9-4774-85e1-fd96521701f7" class="">Everything that exists has Being, has God-essence, has some degree of consciousness. Even a stone has rudimentary consciousness; otherwise, it would not be, and its atoms and molecules would disperse. Everything is alive. The sun, the earth, plants, animals, humans -- all are expressions of consciousness in varying degrees, consciousness manifesting as form.</p><p id="d935ec01-d272-4006-9ad9-cae9a093b1b7" class="">The world arises when consciousness takes on shapes and forms, thought forms and material forms. Look at the millions of life forms on this planet alone. In the sea, on land, in the air -- and then each life form is replicated millions of times. To what end? Is someone or something playing a game, a game with form? This is what the ancient seers of India asked themselves. They saw the world as lila, a kind of divine game that God is playing. The individual life forms are obviously not very important in this game. In the sea, most life forms don&#x27;t survive for more than a few minutes after being born. The human form turns to dust pretty quickly too, and when it is gone it is as if it had never been. Is that tragic or cruel? Only if you create a separate identity for each form, if you forget that its consciousness is God-essence expressing itself in form. But you don&#x27;t truly/now that until you realize your own God-essence as pure consciousness. If a fish is born in your aquarium and you call it John, write out a birth certificate, tell him about his family history, and two minutes later he gets eaten by another fish -- that&#x27;s tragic. But it&#x27;s only tragic because you projected a separate self where there was none. You got hold of a fraction of a dynamic process, a molecular dance, and made a separate entity out of it.</p><p id="aca2cfeb-ff23-47ba-ad55-9c6c4b50ad68" class="">Consciousness takes on the disguise of forms until they reach such complexity that it completely loses itself in them. In present-day humans, consciousness is completely identified with its disguise. It only knows itself as form and therefore lives in fear of the annihilation of its physical or psychological form. This is the egoic mind, and this is where considerable dysfunction sets in. It now looks as if something had gone very wrong somewhere along the line of evolution. But even this is part of <em>lila, </em>the divine game. Finally, the pressure of suffering created by this apparent dysfunction forces consciousness to disidentify from form and awakens it from its dream of form: It regains self-consciousness, but it is at a far deeper level than when it lost it.</p><p id="68744684-ba39-4448-a79f-c4adca72414f" class="">This process is explained by Jesus in his parable of the lost son, who leaves his father&#x27;s home, squanders his wealth, becomes destitute, and is then forced by his suffering to return home. When he does, his father <em>loves him more </em>than before. The son&#x27;s state is the same as it was before, yet not the same. It has an added dimension of depth. The parable describes a journey from unconscious perfection, through apparent imperfection and &quot;evil&quot; to conscious perfection.</p><p id="b744d4f5-6c3f-4ebe-95a5-6dcdad1e68f2" class="">Can you now see the deeper and wider significance of becoming present as the watcher of your mind? Whenever you watch the mind, you withdraw consciousness from mind forms, which then becomes what we call the watcher or the witness. Consequently, the watcher -- pure consciousness beyond form -- becomes stronger, and the mental formations become weaker. When we talk about watching the mind we are personalizing an event that is truly of cosmic significance: through you, consciousness is awakening out of its dream of identification with form and withdrawing from form. This foreshadows, but is already part of, an event that is probably still in the distant future as far as chronological time is concerned. The event is called -- the end of the world.</p><p id="02ccac79-a520-431f-950a-07da96020e3a" class="">When consciousness frees itself from its identification with physical and mental forms, it becomes what we may call pure or enlightened consciousness, or presence. This has already happened in a few individuals, and it seems destined to happen soon on a much larger scale, although there is no absolute guarantee that it <em>will </em>happen. Most humans are still in the grip of the egoic mode of consciousness: identified with their mind and run by their mind. If they do not free themselves from their mind in time, they will be destroyed by it. They will experience increasing confusion, conflict, violence, illness, despair, madness. Egoic mind has become like a sinking ship. If you don&#x27;t get off, you will go down with it. The collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane and destructive entity ever to inhabit this planet. What do you think will happen on this planet if human consciousness remains unchanged?</p><p id="37176c93-bdda-40d6-acb2-439ab17d8742" class="">Already for most humans, the only respite they find from their own minds is to occasionally revert to a level of consciousness below thought. Everyone does that every night during sleep. But this also happens to some extent through sex, alcohol, and other drugs that suppress excessive mind activity. If it weren&#x27;t for alcohol, tranquilizers, antidepressants, as well as the illegal drugs, which are all consumed in vast quantities, the insanity of the human mind would become even more glaringly obvious than it is already. I believe that, if deprived of their drugs, a large part of the population would become a danger to themselves and others. These drugs, of course, simply keep you stuck in dysfunction. Their widespread use only delays the breakdown of the old mind structures and the emergence of-higher consciousness. While individual users may get some relief from the daily torture inflicted on them by their minds, they are prevented from generating enough conscious presence to rise above thought and so find true liberation.</p><p id="e1ae875a-a083-47a6-9272-78d28ac27f9f" class="">Falling back to a level of consciousness below mind, which is the pre-thinking level of our distant ancestors and of-animals and plants, is not an option for us. There is no way back. If-the human race is to survive, it will have to go on to the next stage. Consciousness is evolving throughout the universe in billions of forms. So even if we didn&#x27;t make it, this wouldn&#x27;t matter on a cosmic scale. No gain in consciousness is ever lost, so it would simply express itself through some other form. But the very fact that I am speaking here and you are listening or reading this is a clear sign that the new consciousness <em>is </em>gaining a foothold on the planet.</p><p id="7ad2bda0-7c83-44ab-a6b3-156c90bd5f11" class="">There is nothing personal in this: I am not teaching you. You are consciousness, and you are listening to yourself&#x27;. There is an Eastern saying: &quot;The teacher and the taught together create the teaching.&quot; In any case, the words in themselves are not important. They are not the Truth; they only point to it. I speak from presence, and as I speak, you may be able to join me in that state. Although every word that I use has a history, of&#x27; course, and comes from the past, as all language does, the words that I speak to you now are carriers of the high-energy frequency of presence, quite apart from the meaning they convey as words.</p><p id="35914347-4e79-403c-9350-08d28c95be01" class="">Silence is an even more potent carrier of&#x27; presence, so when you read this or listen to me speak, be aware of the silence between and underneath the words. Be aware of the gaps. To listen to the silence, wherever you are, is an easy and direct way of becoming present. Even if there is noise, there is always some silence underneath and in between the sounds. Listening to the silence immediately creates stillness inside you. Only the stillness in you can perceive the silence outside. And what is stillness other than presence, consciousness freed from thought forms? Here is the living realization of what we have been talking about.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="8eff5642-d61d-4189-bc3d-55b669afe5e7" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Conscioussness, Unconsciousness, Conclusions</summary><p id="7a751ca9-06b4-4f1a-a592-c64851190966" class="">When a problem is not consciously soluble, does the unconscious take over and help to solve it?

To understand what it is made up of, we must observe how we consciously approach a problem. Most of us try to seek an answer to the problem; we are concerned with the solution, and not with the problem. We want a conclusion, we are looking for a way out of the problem; we want to avoid the problem through an answer, through a solution. We do not observe the problem itself but grope for a satisfactory answer. Our whole conscious concern is with the finding of a solution, a satisfying conclusion. Often we do find an answer that gratifies us, and then we think we have solved the problem. What we have actually done is to cover over the problem with a conclusion, with a satisfactory answer; but under the weight of the conclusion, which has temporarily smothered it, the problem is still there. The search for an answer is an evasion of the problem. When there is no satisfactory answer, the conscious or upper mind stops looking; and then the so-called unconscious, the deeper mind, takes over and finds an answer.</p><p id="7033eb79-6b6b-4145-9fd6-cef675d3f4ff" class="">The conscious mind is obviously seeking a way out of the problem, and the way out is a satisfying conclusion. Is not the conscious mind itself made up of conclusions, whether positive or negative, and is it capable of seeking anything else? Is not the upper mind a storehouse of conclusions which are the residue of experiences, the imprints of the past? Surely, the conscious mind is made up of the past, it is founded on the past, for memory is a fabric of conclusions; and with these conclusions, the mind approaches a problem. It is incapable of looking at the problem without the screen of its conclusions; it cannot study, be silently aware of the problem itself. It knows only conclusions, pleasant or unpleasant, and it can only add to itself further conclusions, further ideas, further fixations. Any conclusion is a fixation, and the conscious mind inevitably seeks a conclusion.</p><p id="d4ee04f7-c3d4-4f05-bef1-78d60f56b61d" class="">When it cannot find a satisfactory conclusion, the conscious mind gives up the search, and thereby it becomes quiet; and into the quiet upper mind, the unconscious pops an answer. Now, is the unconscious, the deeper mind, different in its makeup from the conscious mind? Is not the unconscious also made up of racial, group and social conclusions, memories? Surely, the unconscious is also the result of the past, of time, only it is submerged and waiting, and when called upon it throws up its own hidden conclusions. If they are satisfactory, the upper mind accepts them; and if they are not, it flounders about, hoping by some miracle to find an answer. If it does not find an answer, it wearily puts up with the problem, which gradually corrodes the mind. Disease and insanity follow.</p><p id="d1052fb5-194f-4639-aa10-ec70f9328cc1" class="">The upper and the deeper mind are not dissimilar; they are both made up of conclusions, memories, they are both the outcome of the past. They can supply an answer, a conclusion, but they are incapable of dissolving the problem. The problem is dissolved only when both the upper and the deeper mind are silent, when they are not projecting positive or negative conclusions. There is freedom from the problem only when the whole mind is utterly still, choicelessly aware of the problem; for only then the maker of the problem is not.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="65da2fd3-9476-47b8-9057-5255b870e6fc" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Transformation of Consciousness</summary><p id="85929323-ee34-41e8-9e0e-171897042041" class="">The transformation of consciousness represents a profound shift in the way we perceive and interact with the world around us.

Questioning the nature of thought and our relationship with time is essential for consciousness transformation, allowing us to step into the realm of the timeless, where true change can occur.</p><h3 id="6c1e7de9-5a4e-4b6d-97b2-3181021ba654" class="">Observing Without the Observer</h3><p id="9cc7d43a-25ee-4c9b-8339-f5b7413bb3bd" class="">A transformative realization in the journey of consciousness is learning to observe without the duality of the observer and the observed. This state of pure observation allows consciousness to become aware of itself, revealing its content and structure without the distortions of judgment, comparison, or analysis. In this space of clarity, the potential for profound change emerges.</p><h3 id="87118556-330a-40fa-a46e-d54a8de0a29a" class="">Beyond the Known</h3><p id="658ecebf-ef1e-40ce-b836-3d659c9a519b" class="">One of the hallmarks of transformed consciousness is the ability to move beyond the known—the familiar patterns, beliefs, and structures that define our conventional reality. This entails a leap into the unknown, embracing uncertainty and the potential for new ways of being. It is here, in the uncharted territories of consciousness, that we discover the possibility of living in harmony with the totality of existence.</p><h3 id="deb55890-784a-4bb1-828c-bbaa56a9cdac" class="">The Essence of Beauty and the Sacred</h3><p id="b2cc410a-40dc-4184-9219-0c21da6ecda2" class="">In transformed consciousness, beauty and the sacred are experienced not as concepts or external entities but as intrinsic qualities of existence. Beauty is recognized in the absence of the &#x27;me&#x27;, in the moments when the mind is fully present and undivided. Similarly, the sacred is understood as that which transcends thought and time, revealing itself in the silence and stillness beyond the mind&#x27;s constructs.</p><h3 id="f921e9df-300d-4f1a-857a-3b08a3f36ace" class="">The Journey of Meditation</h3><p id="61dc9025-f51b-4748-9121-512b2df36925" class="">Meditation becomes a key tool in the transformation of consciousness, not as a practice confined to specific techniques or traditions, but as a state of being in which the mind is free from the limitations of thought and time. In meditation, we encounter the space of silence and emptiness, where the true nature of consciousness is revealed, and the potential for radical transformation resides.</p></details></li></ul><h1 id="cd0c004f-5607-4d5e-8298-119d798675dc" class="">Topics</h1><ul id="7f690655-db94-4ca9-99b7-fe9a797c81b2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Can Art and Music Help Finding Stillness?</summary><p id="d3682b16-f942-420f-b622-88a6a5dcbf7e" class="">On the one hand, you have the creative process – music, or art. And then you have the finished product – the piece of music that is played, or the work of art that somebody contemplates.</p><p id="b867946e-4870-4709-ad0e-38bd8ae481bf" class="">When you ask, “Can art or music inform the ego of Presence?” – the ego doesn’t know anything about Presence, so it can’t do that. There needs to be some opening in the ego in order for you to be receptive to the power that is latent in music or art, that was created from that deep place. There’s a lot of music and art that’s not necessarily created from that deep place, but the ego is trying to be clever. Let’s talk about some piece of music or work of art that comes out of connectedness with Stillness, or Presence. To some extent, the work of art or the piece of music still carries that energy field. It can put a person in touch with the deeper dimension within. A there’s a little bit of an opening is required. If there’s only the density of the ego, then the transformational possibilities of art or music are not realized. A little opening is required in the viewer, or the listener, and then it can be quite a wonderful thing to listen to music or to contemplate a work of art. You can be transported, if only for a moment, into that alert stillness out of which it originally came. That’s a beautiful thing.</p><p id="19204b44-01e4-4498-90f2-5637374c9908" class="">Another aspect is “losing oneself” – going too deep, almost losing oneself in the ground out of which creativity comes. In the creative process, there’s always a balance that’s needed, so that you don’t lose yourself in Being. It could happen to an artist, it can happen to some people who awaken spiritually – they suddenly plunge so deeply into Being that they lose all interest in doing. That happened to some spiritual masters, who spent several years being without doing anything.</p><p id="db61040a-5f18-4feb-8446-fe8c09f00893" class="">For example, Ramana Maharshi in India had to be fed for several years because he would not even pick up food. He was so immersed in Being that he just sat there. People recognized something extraordinary about him – which they would not have done in the West – and they put food in his mouth. But there was certainly a loss of balance, he could no longer function in this world. This of course, is an extreme example. Gradually, after a few years he was beginning to function again, and he was able to regain a balance between dealing with things out here and connectedness with Being. In a slightly minor way it happened to me, when I lost interest completely in ‘doing’ and drifted around for two years. It wasn’t a “problem” to me, it was only a problem to people who were watching me, or who knew me. So there was a loss of balance for a while, but gradually the balance re-established itself. I didn’t have a teacher, as such, so it turned out to be a natural process.</p><p id="327a4eb5-2be8-4cbf-a805-cf0832fd4bb4" class="">As long as you go within, and give form to that which is resting in the formless, be used by it – so that through you it can come into this world of form. Don’t stay down there and lose yourself in it – that’s not necessary.</p><p id="d942c107-1716-4674-a6a1-51fce542793c" class="">Music is a wonderful way of getting in touch with the stillness within.</p><p id="5ae31e08-f75f-46f3-b688-058a2c790a3e" class="">For the listener, it is important not to become dependent, however, on anything external to enter the state of Presence. Whereas music can be a help, there too needs to be a balance. If the only time you can become still is when you listen to a certain kind of music, then that’s not quite it, because you are depending on something external to get in touch with that. Use it as a help, and this is the same as a spiritual teacher or spiritual teaching – it can be a great help to listen to a tape or see a video, but don’t become totally dependent on that. Every good spiritual teacher will tell you, when the time comes “enough is enough”. The true teacher is within you. What you see in me, that which you find so precious in me, must be in you – otherwise you wouldn’t see it. A good teacher will always direct you back to yourself, and not foster any kind of dependency.</p><p id="9cdad7e6-c203-4e6d-a2ea-aaef9dd796bf" class="">Knowing what is a help, using it, but not becoming dependent. Eventually it is necessary for you to go there without any help. You can still appreciate teachers, and teachings. I love listening to other spiritual teachers if they come from a deep place, I have great joy, and I think “Wow, this is so wonderful”. Or reading a spiritual book that comes from the deepest place – there’s still great joy in that. It has nothing to do with needing, it’s enjoying a slightly different expression of the same deep truth. It’s wonderful.</p><p id="3262fa22-e912-41c5-b51d-d81b7308327b" class="">Sometimes holding that space of simple Presence activates other factors that then come in, seemingly, from the outside to change the situation. You have activated the intelligence of the totality. It’s not necessarily coming through this form. That is why people speak of synchronistic things happening, suddenly a helpful factor comes in, suddenly the right person appears, the right thing happens. Almost miraculous when you don’t know that it’s natural, it seems like a miracle at first because most humans are not used to that.</p><p id="1c405829-222f-4b0b-a911-03d7d74dd9f2" class="">Also, you can see it wherever it is – no matter in what form it is hiding. You can see the truth shining through wherever it is hiding. It might be hiding in some ancient religion, very deeply. There you see it, shining through – there may be a lot of mythology around it, a lot of cultural beliefs around it, and yet deep down there you can see this is the truth, shining through all the mythology around it and so on. It is who you are.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="f0341155-93c0-4fe8-be0f-975f28e71595" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Finding Balance</summary><p id="5a0aea43-128f-4e22-adb0-6868195f61f0" class="">By living aligned with the present moment, you also align your will with the universal will, which you could call “the will of God”. You don’t have a separate will. The separate will wants to enhance or strengthen one’s sense of self.</p><p id="38ccacf5-03c5-41e0-ab46-4e49a19bfbfb" class="">The separate will is concerned with the “me”, the “I”, the ego. But there is a divine Consciousness, the one Consciousness, there is an evolutionary impulse. What we are doing here at every moment, is to align ourselves with that.</p><p id="be322bb2-2390-4ed4-86a3-9ca7bce6df6c" class="">Non-resistance is vital because as long as you are in resistance to the present moment, you will be trapped in the little egoic will. The egoic will needs to subside – that’s surrender to the present moment, and surrender to what is. When you align yourself with what is internally, it looks at first almost like a position of weakness, and it can be misinterpreted as something that prevents you from taking effective action. But the acceptance of what is, is totally compatible with responding to whatever the present moment requires. Whatever wants to be created, manifested, done, at this moment – to be aligned with that, you need to first accept whatever form this moment takes.</p><p id="a8195598-5062-4585-b543-345c31f239d3" class="">Single out this moment only. For example, when you are ill, you don’t say “I need to accept this illness, the fact that I am ill, that I am suffering from this” because that is a whole conceptual story. All you need to accept is this moment as it is. There is never actually an illness in this moment, there is only a physical condition. There may be pain, there may be weakness, disability, discomfort. Those things may be there, and that’s the only thing you accept. This moment is as it is now.</p><p id="2ed9d6cb-2f5f-47f2-bdf2-3d5eee5132af" class="">If you are stuck in the mud somewhere, you don’t say, “Okay, I am in the mud, I have to accept it, and here I am – I’m not taking any action because I have to accept what is”. This moment is already always as it is, and there’s nothing you can do about that. That’s what you accept. Then, action that arises has a different energy to it. The will that flows into what you do is no longer egoic. When you have not accepted this moment, the will goes against the Universe – that is what the ego does. It is negative, it fights something that it says shouldn’t be there. If you use negativity, you are trapped in ego. The “little will” has to subside for the more powerful will to flow through and deal with the situation. It creates, it is not isolated from the totality. It is one with the totality. When that operates, another word for that universal will is intelligence. It’s only when you look at a situation, completely accept the is-ness of this moment, and then of course action may be required.</p><p id="5f0ee9b9-bcf7-4b39-8302-1d607c9f04da" class="">Once the opening is there, through acceptance, the next step that you take will be much more powerful. There’s a Buddhist term “right action”, that can only arise out of the right state of Consciousness. You have to get out of the ego first before you can have right action. The Buddha was talking about that which flows from the awakened state of consciousness. To surrender the little will is to say ‘yes’ to the present moment. It’s not a big thing, just say yes to what is – because it already is anyway. Why complain about something that is? It’s insane, but normal.</p><p id="4a897e88-29fd-4057-9ba3-dae7aab6db6a" class="">To give up the egoic will, all you have to do is not complain about what is. Be aligned with the isness – people, situations, whatever – this is already as it is. It’s the inevitability of is. Become friendly with what is, and you become intelligent for the first time.</p><p id="c56bded8-7392-4146-90b5-a39ce58fe3b2" class="">With the simple act of surrender to the inevitability of the present moment, another energy comes. You could call that universal will, you could call that intelligence, you could call that the creative solution to whatever the so-called “problem” is. You could call that power coming in, that is greater than the limited power of your mind. Or it may use your mind, and suddenly you say the right thing, if that’s what the situation requires. Suddenly the words come – where do the words come from? You don’t know what you’re going to say next. They come from a deeper level because that intelligence uses the mind.</p><p id="082fbbb0-e369-4971-aa71-3ac1bb3ad78b" class="">You and the Universe become one, and as such it creates through you as this form. That’s the beauty of it. When the unmanifested flows into this world, it assumes form. Most thoughts that people have in the unawakened state are repetitive old thoughts, conditioned thinking, conditioned by the past. All you can rely on then is what you have accumulated in the past, you deal with things through conditioned thinking. When the simple act of surrender opens your mind, it can then be used as an instrument. Then, a thought may come in that is original and fresh and new. That is the birth of form. The birth of thought creates the birth of form. The Universe uses you as a vehicle or a channel through which to create. You are one. It can use your mind, and become thought, words, physical things. That’s the way in which the mind can actually be a helpful tool – alignment with the greater Intelligence, the One Consciousness.</p><p id="d79df180-68bc-49cc-9a99-c6144cd122fc" class="">It all starts with the present moment, and your relationship with the present moment. Friend or enemy? Are you allowing it, or are you fighting it, resisting it? That’s the end of ego – because the ego needs resistance. The ego survives through complaining, it survives through denying, or wanting something else.</p><p id="22d6fcc5-a3c0-402e-8236-0b2ab0a32d8b" class="">The present moment is the teacher. Work with that – that’s all you need, really. That’s the end of the “little will”, which isn’t all that powerful anyway. Whatever it creates, creates more problems. It seems so simple, and it is simple. And yet, because of the many thousands of years of habit-patterns, often people tell me “It’s so difficult to be in the present moment and allow it to be”. Of course, the opposite is true. Life becomes difficult if you don’t. What you accept is the form of this moment. No more. Then, see what’s needed. You are not truly intelligent until that happens.</p><p id="7e4bc5bd-a416-4db5-8192-858560c4d545" class="">Sometimes holding that space of simple Presence activates other factors that then come in, seemingly, from the outside to change the situation. You have activated the intelligence of the totality. It’s not necessarily coming through this form. That is why people speak of synchronistic things happening, suddenly a helpful factor comes in, suddenly the right person appears, the right thing happens. Almost miraculous when you don’t know that it’s natural, it seems like a miracle at first because most humans are not used to that.</p><p id="765f796b-3271-48f2-9716-b3882d2385b4" class="">When you hold Presence, sometimes the change may not happen through your action. There are many situations where action at this moment is not possible. Sometimes there’s nothing you can do, however you can continue to be present. Then, a greater intelligence is activated. Very often you will find change happening in the situation.</p><p id="b27c7f2e-43b9-4f0c-a285-040104964b3e" class="">This greater intelligence is not the conceptual intelligence that you can measure with IQ tests. It is non-conceptual intelligence. Conceptual intelligence is the ability to retain information, analyze, compare, and so forth. It’s a tiny fragment of what intelligence is. There is a vastness of non-conceptual intelligence. Our destiny is to be in that way, so that our whole life is to become a work of art. Not just be confined to that state of consciousness when you do your creative work. Any creative thing has a spark, an aliveness, a quality, a newness, a freshness. You connect with non-conceptual intelligence in the alert Stillness within. Everybody has that, as their essence. That is true intelligence. To what extent you are connected with that could not possibly be measured through any IQ test. Ultimately, you cannot measure creativity.</p><p id="5b02e426-1ed4-41c1-bdc7-01617ce080ca" class="">Very often, the form of the present moment seems like a limitation on your life, something that is impinging on your freedom. The body could become ill, you may find it hard to move. When something drastic happens, if you can learn to accept it, a little bit of spaciousness comes into your life. You say, “this is what is”. A little bit of space just opened up, and you’re no longer just a resisting entity. Then, you realize that you are essentially formless space. In other words, you find inner peace. At first it is very gentle in the background, in the midst of any situation. That peace is powerful. It can become so powerful, that is obliterates almost anything. Peace is the formless in you. By accepting the form, the formless within you opens up. This is how something seemingly bad – a limitation – becomes an opening for realization of who you truly are.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a88410b0-d7c4-4f45-be7d-4666915e6e60" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Outer and Inner Purpose</summary><p id="5b5f6b2d-7c44-4997-b06f-210c93244b3c" class="">Astronomers have discovered evidence to suggest that the universe came into existence fifteen billion years ago in a gigantic explosion and has been expanding ever since. Not only has it been expanding, but it is also growing in complexity and becoming more and more differentiated. Some scientists also postulate that this movement from unity to multiplicity will eventually become reversed. The universe will then stop expanding and begin to contract again and finally return to the unmanifested, the inconceivable nothingness out of which it came—and perhaps repeat the cycles of birth, expansion, contraction, and death again and again. For what purpose? “Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?” asks physicist Stephen Hawking, realizing at the same time that no mathematical model could ever supply the answer.</p><p id="70a7e024-b64e-42ab-bc93-89db1ca4621f" class="">If you look within rather than only without, however, you discover that you have an inner and an outer purpose, and since you are a microcosmic reflection of the macrocosm, it follows that the universe too has an inner and outer purpose inseparable from yours. The outer purpose of the universe is to create form and experience the interaction of forms—the play, the dream, the drama, or whatever you choose to call it. Its inner purpose is to awaken to its formless essence. Then comes the reconciliation of outer and inner purpose: to bring that essence—consciousness—into the world of form and thereby transform the world. The ultimate purpose of that transformation goes far beyond anything the human mind can imagine or comprehend. And yet, on this planet at this time, that transformation is the task allotted us. That is the reconciliation of outer and inner purpose, the reconciliation of the world and God.</p><p id="5cd1e934-b8fd-4707-a3c6-410c3a0101ef" class="">Before we look at what relevance the expansion and contraction of the universe has to your own life, we need to bear in mind here that nothing we say about the nature of the universe should be taken as an absolute truth. Neither concepts nor mathematical formulae can explain the infinite. No thought can encapsulate the vastness of the totality. Reality is a unified whole, but thought cuts it up into fragments. This gives rise to fundamental misperceptions, for example, that there are separate things and events, or that this is the cause of that. Every thought implies a perspective, and every perspective, by its very nature, implies limitation, which ultimately means that it is not true, at least not absolutely. Only the whole is true, but the whole cannot be spoken or thought. Seen from beyond the limitations of thinking and therefore incomprehensible to the human mind, everything is happening now. All that ever has been or will be is now, outside of time, which is a mental construct.</p><p id="ccd710b1-dc42-4e72-84c1-6e87b7928481" class="">As an illustration of relative and absolute truth, consider the sunrise and sunset. When we say the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening, that is true, but only relatively. In absolute terms, it is false. Only from the limited perspective of an observer on or near the planet’s surface does the sun rise and set. If you were far out in space, you would see that the sun neither rises nor sets, but that it shines continuously. And yet, even after realizing that, we can continue to speak of the sunrise or sunset, still see its beauty, paint it, write poems about it, even though we now know that it is a relative rather than an absolute truth.</p><p id="5a9fb8a6-1bee-4e77-a9b5-830d1611f926" class="">So let us continue to speak for a moment of another relative truth: the coming into form of the universe and its return to the formless, which implies the limited perspective of time, and see what relevance this has to your own life. The notion of “my own life” is, of course, another limited perspective created by thought, another relative truth. There is ultimately no such thing as “your” life, since you and life are not two, but one.</p><p id="fd69c5b9-16cf-4b93-946f-da2d91391240" class="">When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know where you are going or at least the general direction in which you are moving, but don&#x27;t forget: the only thing that is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you are taking at this moment. That&#x27;s all there ever is.</p><p id="83000962-2216-41d8-8693-2bac1f71f294" class="">Your life&#x27;s journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to do, to achieve this or that, which, of course, implies future. But if your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become more important to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely miss the journey&#x27;s inner purpose, which has nothing to do with <em>where </em>you are going or <em>what </em>you are doing, but everything to do with <em>how. </em>It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment. The outer purpose belongs to the horizontal dimension of space and time; the inner purpose concerns a deepening of your Being in the vertical dimension of the timeless Now. Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you are taking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this one step, you realize that it already contains within itself all the other steps as well as the destination. This one step then becomes transformed into an expression of perfection, an act of great beauty and quality. It will have taken you into Being, and the light of Being will shine through it. This is both the purpose and the fulfillment of your inner journey, the journey into yourself.</p><p id="41bc14d8-cca0-45cc-bfb3-ecc41553fba9" class=""><em>Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or fail in the world?</em></p><p id="ded0785b-790e-4ed0-87ad-765c27dfef81" class="">It will matter to you as long as you haven&#x27;t realized your inner purpose. After that, the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outer purpose and at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the other way</p><p id="8365921b-537a-4b2b-8875-f295b91821b5" class="">around, which is actually more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to &quot;gain the world and lose your soul,&quot; as Jesus puts it. Ultimately, of course, <em>every </em>outer purpose is doomed to &quot;fail&quot; sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you make it subservient to your inner purpose.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="9b96734a-e2c0-4d3b-a13a-bedd3020c27f" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Ambition and Vocation</summary><p id="e0950a79-8ec9-47cc-9642-4d74b1753e2c" class="">ONE OF THE CAUSES of fear is ambition, is it not? And are you all not ambitious? What is your ambition? To pass some examination? To become a governor? Or, if you are very young, perhaps you just want to become an engine-driver, to drive engines across a bridge. But why are you ambitious? What does it mean? Have you ever thought about it? Have you noticed older people, how ambitious they are? In your own family, have you not heard your father or your uncle talk about getting more salary, or occupying some prominent position? In our society – and I have explained what our society is, everybody is doing that, trying to be on top. They all want to become somebody, do they not? The clerk wants to become the manager, the manager wants to become something bigger, and so on and so on – the continual struggle to become. If I am a teacher, I want to become the principal; if I am the principal, I want to become the manager. If you are ugly, you want to be beautiful. Or you want to have more money, more saris, more clothes, more furniture, houses, property – more and more and more. Not only outwardly, but also inwardly, in the so-called spiritual sense, you want to become somebody, though you cover that ambition by a lot of words. Have you not noticed that? And you think it is perfectly all right, don’t you? You think it is perfectly normal, justifiable, right.</p><p id="f3ec4ffa-4487-4b61-bb4d-d2a3dc3badbd" class="">Now, what has ambition done in the world? So few of us have ever thought about it. When you see a man struggling to gain, to achieve, to get ahead of somebody else, have you ever asked yourself what is in his heart? If you will look into your own heart when you are ambitious, when you are struggling to become somebody, spiritually or in the wordily sense, you will find there the worm of fear. The ambitious man is the most frightened of men, because he is afraid to be what he is. He says, ‘If remain what I am, I shall be nobody, therefore I must be somebody, I must become a magistrate, a judge, a minister’. If you examine this process very closely, if you go behind the screen of words and ideas, beyond the wall of status and success, you will find there is fear; because the ambitious man is afraid to be what he is. He thinks that what he is in himself is insignificant, poor, ugly; he feels lonely, utterly empty, therefore he says, ‘I must go and achieve something’. So either he goes after what he calls God, which is just another form of ambition, or he tries to become somebody in the world. In this way his loneliness, his sense of inward emptiness – of which he is really frightened – is covered up. He runs away from it, and ambition becomes the means through which he can escape.</p><p id="0e7c90e6-8efc-4fe5-9191-ee25872f863b" class="">So, what is happening in the world? Everybody is fighting somebody. One man feels less than another and struggles to get to the top. There is no love, there is no consideration, there is no deep thought. Or society is a constant battle of man against man. This struggle is born of the ambition to become somebody, and the older people encourage you to be ambitious. They want you to amount to something, to marry a rich man or a rich woman, to have influential friends. Being frightened, ugly in their hearts, they try to make you like themselves; and you in turn want to be like them, because you see the glamour of it all. When the governor comes, everybody bows down to the earth to receive him, they give him garlands, make speeches. He loves it, and you love it too. You feel honoured if you know his uncle or his clerk, and you bask in the sunshine of his ambition, his achievements. So you are easily caught in the ugly web of the older generation, in the pattern of this monstrous society. Only if you are very alert, constantly watchful, only if you are not afraid and do not accept, but question all the time – only then will you not be caught, but go beyond and create a different world.</p><p id="5b15d013-cea1-44c3-ab93-749d5c8c1ea5" class="">That is why it is very important for you to find your true vocation. Do you know what ‘vocation’ means? Something which you love to do, which is natural to you. After all, that is the function of education – to help you to grow independently so that you are free of ambition and can find your true vocation. The ambitious man has never found his true vocation; if he had, he would not be ambitious.</p><p id="19c487c2-63a1-48dc-b486-8ad6a62d6045" class="">So, it is the responsibility of the teachers, of the principal, to help you to be intelligent, unafraid, so that you can find your true vocation, your own way of life, the way you really want to live and earn your livelihood. This implies a revolution in thinking; because, in our present society, the man who can talk, the man who can write, the man who can rule, the man who has a big car, is thought to be in a marvellous position; and the man who digs in the garden, who cooks, who builds a house, is despised.</p><p id="b2315ddb-050c-49d4-bae1-d2e52071d58a" class="">Are you aware of your own feelings when you look at a mason, at the man who mends the road, or drives a taxi, or pulls a cart? Have you noticed how you regard him with absolute contempt? To you he hardly even exists. You disregard him; but when a man has a title of some kind, or is a banker, a merchant, a guru, or a minister, you immediately respect him. But if you really find your true vocation, you will help to break down this rotten system completely; because then, whether you are a gardener, or a painter, or an engineer, you will be doing something which you love with your whole being; and that is not ambition. To do something marvellously well, to do it completely, truly, according to what you deeply think and feel – that is not ambition and in that there is no fear.</p><p id="47878c3a-c8f5-4577-bf76-4a908873b02d" class="">To help you to discover your true vocation is very difficult, because it means that the teacher has to pay a great deal of attention to each student to find out what he is capable of. He has to help him not to be afraid, but to question, to investigate. You may be a potential writer, or a poet, or a painter. Whatever it is, if you really love to do it, you are not ambitious; because in love there is no ambition.</p><p id="ddfb2a00-1ef4-4f18-adaa-8890bcfd4c65" class="">So, is it not very important while you are young that you should be helped to awaken your own intelligence and thereby find your true vocation? Then you will love what you do, right through life, which means there will be no ambition, no competition, no fighting another for position, for prestige; and then perhaps you will be able to create a new world. In that new world all the ugly things of the older generation will cease to exist – their wars, their mischief, their separative gods, their rituals which mean absolutely nothing, their sovereign governments, their violence. That is why the responsibility of the teachers, and of the students, is very great.</p><p id="d056831e-8898-47b7-8747-e5c8d133f30d" class="">Questioner: If somebody has an ambition to be an engineer, does it not mean that he is interested in engineering? Krishnamurti: Would you say that being interested in something is ambition? We can give to that word ‘ambition’ various meanings. To me, ambition is the outcome of fear. But if as a boy I am interested in being an engineer because I want to build beautiful structures, marvellous irrigation systems, splendid roads, it means I love engineering; and that is not ambition. In love there is no fear.</p><p id="c94ed2a2-0671-4936-8236-eb6289e6d249" class="">So, ambition and interest are two different things, are they not? If I am really interested in painting, if I love to paint, then I do not compete to be the best or the most famous painter. I just love painting. You may be better at painting than I, but I do not compare myself with you. When I paint, I love what I am doing, and for me that is sufficient in itself.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="d48d1ec0-d611-4440-a9e7-24d009b485b4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>How do we navigate our complex existence?</summary><p id="9b2bcf52-90bf-4cd1-926e-46f2f5af3351" class="">Living in the world poses a challenging question: How do we navigate this complex existence? The world is rife with violence, greed, hypocrisy, competition, and brutality. Often, we find ourselves entangled in this chaos, even when we wish to disengage.

Is it possible to break free from the constant pull of the past, which gives rise to ideals and escapes?</p><p id="f431a3fb-5dc6-4cf9-8312-0b8e1be02f0e" class="">The world is both external and internal; it encompasses our relationships with people, objects, and ideas. The fragmentation in the world mirrors the inner divisions within us. Our external world reflects our internal state.</p><p id="0bda50bb-b6ea-4685-92c6-4e1f78c59ee2" class="">To truly live differently, we must start by acknowledging our role in creating this fragmented reality. We are part of the problem, and only by recognizing this can we hope to be part of the solution. Our longing for change arises from the understanding that our present state is unsustainable.</p><p id="2342d6e9-7ede-46ad-8f8f-7fe525a73e14" class="">Change is not a mere shift from one known state to another. It isn&#x27;t about replacing one set of ideals with another or seeking an opposite. True change transcends these superficial transformations. Change is not a linear process; it&#x27;s not about trading one illusion for another. It requires a deeper understanding of the self and the world.</p><p id="1aa3dbe4-4b0f-477a-9fdd-a42d528ea3cc" class="">Our emotions, such as anger, violence, and fear, cannot be conquered by their opposites. Attempting to suppress them with their opposites only creates inner conflict. Instead, we must observe these emotions without labeling or identifying with them. Naming them strengthens their hold on us.</p><p id="23c31fca-9aa9-4f68-89a7-df6028484edf" class="">In this journey of self-discovery and transformation, we may feel cornered, confronted by the triviality of our conditioned selves.

It encompasses the beauty of love, the power of wealth, and every aspiration that the human mind can conceive. However, it seems that many people live in a state of hangover, clouded by their own judgments. Even in the very act of formulating a question, their condemnations are unmistakably pronounced.</p><p id="ae42d9b3-bb48-41c3-9707-dbce2bf34fb6" class="">They might ask, &quot;You mentioned living life to the fullest the other day, but what does that mean? Is it about indulging in physical pleasures, accumulating wealth, and pursuing worldly ambitions?&quot; The underlying condemnation is evident. It&#x27;s as though they already know the answer before posing the question. Their preconceived notions are crystal clear: cut off desires, shun physical pleasures, disregard material wealth, and distance oneself from people. In their minds, they question what kind of life remains after such severe pruning. This warrants our understanding: the term &#x27;life&#x27; loses its significance when we strip away everything from it. Anything and everything can be criticized.</p><p id="6d2bde25-d180-4704-b70c-0883849ac450" class="">Consider the act of eating. To some, it might appear as mere chewing and swallowing of food, a seemingly trivial act. Yet, when you separate it from the whole of existence, it can seem meaningless and absurd. Such critiques have been echoed by religious figures throughout history, constantly condemning various aspects of life. They possess the uncanny ability to find fault in anything, to cast a shadow of disapproval. Savoring a meal, for instance, is a vital part of life, but anyone can label it as trivial. Breathing, which involves inhaling and exhaling air, may seem tedious to some. Waking up in the morning, working, facing daily challenges – all these are dismissed as mere miseries. Even the act of making love, the union of two bodies, is decried as a crude exchange of saliva and germs. Every aspect of life, it seems, can be tainted with criticism.</p><p id="35b10011-1c61-4b8f-ba1a-980ff939cdee" class="">The fundamental question we must ask ourselves is this: What were these critics expecting in the first place? Did they anticipate discovering gold or diamonds hidden within the human body? Did they anticipate something more beautiful than what they already possessed? We seldom ponder these questions. Instead, we focus on the perceived shortcomings and impurities. Rather than appreciating the body&#x27;s intricate workings and its ability to function efficiently for decades, critics are fixated on the dirt and imperfections within.</p><p id="b89b62e2-a98d-4f4c-8226-3545bb89d804" class="">These critics seem to have a knack for finding flaws, regardless of the situation. They can find fault in anything. Show them a rose, and they&#x27;ll notice its inevitable withering. Display a vibrant rainbow, and they&#x27;ll dismiss it as an illusion. Condemning is effortless, and thus, condemners are often articulate in their critiques. They&#x27;ve refrained from extolling life because articulating the positive aspects of life is challenging – life is too vast and multifaceted to capture with words.</p><p id="a2cc46ad-3bc1-49c0-8f2c-eecbb4fa22bc" class="">For instance, the philosopher Hegel once stood under a starry night sky with the poet Heinrich Heine. Heine marveled at the beauty of the night and expressed his wonder. Hegel, however, remained completely silent. When Heine inquired about Hegel&#x27;s thoughts, Hegel shockingly referred to the stars as a &quot;leprosy of the sky.&quot; Condemnation is effortless, while appreciation demands more. Appreciating life entails proving its positive aspects, and this can be quite difficult.</p><p id="8b392943-af2a-4d89-906b-99e7f4c5601e" class="">Instead of rejecting worldly desires, let us contemplate them. Every desire, by its very nature, is worldly. Even desires for God or heaven are worldly desires, as they seek something beyond this world. Desire invariably pulls us away from the present moment. Life unfolds here and now, while desire projects us into the future. To desire is to exist in the world of desire. It is not about renouncing desires but understanding them. In the light of understanding, desires naturally dissipate, just as darkness vanishes when a lamp is lit. So, there&#x27;s no need to struggle with desires; rather, strive to comprehend them. When you understand desire, you transcend the need to either indulge or suppress it.</p><p id="46e52eb8-907c-4352-a51d-ec8d9e52fa33" class="">Dependence on others is often viewed negatively, as if it diminishes one&#x27;s independence. However, we are inherently interconnected beings. Independence is an illusion. We depend on the earth, the sun, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and countless other elements for our existence. We are interdependent with the entire cosmos. Embrace this interdependence instead of resisting it.</p><p id="b28d11f4-1549-4833-b763-27f0e709988f" class="">Live life to the fullest, for the divine is ever-present within it. Every moment is an opportunity for God to manifest in myriad ways. When a smile graces your path, it is God smiling at you through that person. A blooming flower is God opening His heart to you. The bird&#x27;s song is God serenading you. Life is an offering to the divine, and you are always on sacred ground. When you live life to its fullest, you welcome God&#x27;s presence in all its diverse forms, rather than remaining aloof and detached. Embrace every facet of life and let it unfold in all its intensity. Dance with existence, for each moment brings God closer in countless ways.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="9052b504-3cdb-4ca2-95be-192da16e86f2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Joy of Being</summary><p id="a100d5b9-58ba-4cd5-93f0-16de81e94517" class="">To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there isn&#x27;t, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle.</p><p id="0136c0ae-68e3-479e-94fc-8d6bea172c08" class="">If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change w/#t you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. &quot;How&quot; is always more important than &quot;what.&quot; See if you can give much more attention to the <em>doing </em>than to the result that you want to achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This implies that you also completely accept what <em>is, </em>because you cannot give your full attention to something and at the same time resist it.</p><p id="4589fc70-587b-4b54-b67d-e5c9a1617113" class="">As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love -- even the most simple action. So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action -- just give attention to the action itself. The fruit will come of its own accord. This is a powerful spiritual practice. In the <em>Bhagavad Gita, </em>one of the oldest and most beautiful spiritual teachings in existence, non-attachment to the fruit of your action is called Karma Yoga. It is described as the path of &quot;consecrated action.&quot;</p><p id="1af219b9-6d0b-4259-ae8b-7f000ccf0a6e" class="">When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of Being flows into everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfillment and satisfaction -- you don&#x27;t look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of Being. You have found the life underneath your life situation.</p><p id="b31cecb3-0041-45fe-9197-61462a632a3a" class="">In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived from Being, not from your personal past. Therefore, the psychological need to become anything other than who you are already is no longer there. In the world, on the level of your life situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowledgeable, successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper dimension of Being you are complete and whole now.</p><p id="ae75a754-7299-48fb-ade0-a0ee28f8294f" class=""><em>In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to pursue external goals ?</em></p><p id="f6e20870-cf8f-414d-a25b-6c1df58ed2c8" class="">Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that anything or anybody in the future will save you or make you happy. As far as your life situation is concerned, there may be things to be attained or acquired. That&#x27;s the world of form, of gain and loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when you realize that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do. Being free of psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals with grim determination, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become someone. Nor will you remain inactive through fear of failure, which to the ego is loss of self. When your deeper sense of self is derived from Being, when you are free of &quot;becoming&quot; as a psychological need, neither your happiness nor your sense of self depends on the outcome, and so there is freedom from fear. You don&#x27;t seek permanency where it cannot be found: in the world of form, of gain and loss, birth and death. You don&#x27;t demand that situations, conditions, places, or people should make you happy, and then suffer when they don&#x27;t live up to your expectations.</p><p id="e79e758f-4559-4041-a2d7-a43eb65489b8" class="">Everything is honored, but nothing matters.

You may find it helpful to close your eyes for this practice. Later on, when &quot;being in the body&quot; has become natural and easy, this will no longer be necessary. Direct your attention into the body. Feel it from within. Is it alive? Is there life in your hands, arms, legs, and feet -- in your abdomen, your chest? Can you feel the subtle energy field that pervades the entire body and</p><p id="d3824a1c-7527-4f83-ae83-0935973a43c6" class="">gives vibrant life to every organ and every cell? Can you feel it simultaneously in all parts of the body as a single field of energy? Keep focusing on the feeling of your inner body for a few moments. Do not start to think about it. Feet it. The more attention you give it, the clearer and stronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell is becoming more alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your body becoming luminous. Although such an image can help you temporarily, pay more attention to the feeling than to any image that may arise. An image, no matter how beautiful or powerful, is already defined in form, so there is less scope for penetrating more deeply.</p><p id="22c30b47-347b-458c-a5e8-34041ddab386" class="">The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable.

All the basic bodily functions -- pleasure, pain, breathing, eating, drinking, defecating, sleeping, the drive to find a mate and procreate, and of course birth and death -- we share with the animals. A long time after their fall from a state of grace and oneness into illusion, humans suddenly woke up in what seemed to be an animal body -- and they found this very disturbing. &quot;Don&#x27;t fool yourself. You are no more than an animal.&quot; This seemed to be the truth that was staring them in the face. But it was too disturbing a truth to tolerate. Adam and Eve saw that they were naked, and they became afraid. Unconscious denial of their animal nature set in very quickly. The threat that they might be taken over by powerful instinctual drives and revert back to complete unconsciousness was indeed a very real one. Shame and taboos appeared around certain parts of the body and bodily functions, especially sexuality. The light of their consciousness was not yet strong enough to make friends with their animal nature, to allow it to be and even enjoy that aspect of themselves -- let alone to go deeply into it to find the divine hidden within it, the reality within the illusion. So they did what they had to do. They began to disassociate from their body. They now saw themselves as <em>having </em>a body, rather than just being it.</p><p id="8240ab63-a5b8-415d-926d-3b6388f3a23f" class="">When religions arose, this disassociation became even more pronounced as the &quot;you are not your body&quot; belief. Countess people in East and West throughout the ages have tried to find God, salvation, or enlightenment through denial of the body. This took the form of denial of sense pleasures and of sexuality in particular, fasting, and other ascetic practices. They even inflicted pain on the body in an attempt to weaken or punish it because they regarded it as sinful. In Christianity, this used to be called mortification of the flesh. Others tried to escape from the body by entering trance states or seeking out- of-the-body experiences. Many still do. Even the Buddha is said to have practiced body denial through fasting and extreme forms of asceticism for six years, but he did</p><p id="f8007393-b5e9-4a56-8b1c-ca08af825271" class="">not attain enlightenment until after he had given up this practice.</p><p id="fc1d2b37-d5db-4653-bf92-452d1326564e" class="">The fact is that no one has ever become enlightened through denying or fighting the body or through an out-of-the-body experience. Although such an experience can be fascinating and can give you a glimpse of the state of liberation from the material form, in the end you will always have to return to the body, where the essential work of transformation takes place. Transformation is <em>through </em>the body, not away from it. This is why no true master has ever advocated fighting or leaving the body, although their mind- based followers often have.</p><p id="7aa5bc6e-d8b9-461e-8dc5-47a04ef85189" class="">Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain fragments survive, such as Jesus&#x27; statement that &quot;your whole body will be filled with light,&quot; or they survive as myths, such as the belief that Jesus never relinquished his body but remained one with it and ascended into &quot;heaven&quot; with it. Almost no one to this day has understood those fragments or the hidden meaning of certain myths, and the &quot;you are not your body&quot; belief has prevailed universally, leading to body denial and attempts to escape from the body. Countless seekers have thus been prevented from attaining spiritual realization for themselves and becoming finders.</p><p id="0529c0e4-0b08-4d1d-a3fa-1abbd0aaee5b" class=""><em>Is it possible to recover the lost teachings on the significance of the body or to reconstruct them from the existing fragments ?</em></p><p id="205eb2f7-5aa8-48ff-b15d-c58ffeea626e" class="">There is no need for that.

Although all spiritual teachings originate from the same Source, once they become verbalized and written down they are obviously no more than collections of words <strong>-- </strong>and a word is nothing but a signpost, as we talked about earlier. All such teachings are signposts pointing the way back to the Source.</p><p id="93df75b1-5ea4-4b5a-9ea0-5876aad58168" class="">I have already spoken of the Truth that is hidden within your body, but I will summarize for you again the lost teachings of the masters -- so here is another signpost. Please endeavor to feel your inner body as you read or listen.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="6f894c15-87ba-4554-bdc4-562fe2a4c7ad" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Going deeply into the body</summary><p id="15be5377-f087-47e4-9b22-e4b4d386d5c3" class="">Make it into a meditation. It needn&#x27;t take long. Ten to fifteen minutes of clock time should be sufficient. Make sure first that there are no external distractions such as telephones or people who are likely to interrupt you. Sit on a chair, but don&#x27;t lean back. Keep the spine erect. Doing so will help you to stay alert. Alternatively, choose your own favorite position for meditation.</p><p id="d5eb42cd-7b39-4fe3-9d63-47f731220d7e" class="">Make sure the body is relaxed. Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. Feel yourself breathing into the lower abdomen, as it were. Observe how it expands and contracts slightly with each in and out breath. Then become aware of the entire inner energy field of the body. Don&#x27;t think about it <em>--feel </em>it. By doing this, you reclaim consciousness from the mind. If you find it helpful, use the &quot;light&quot; visualization I described earlier.</p><p id="73684237-17cc-438b-b8f9-97618c83c021" class="">When you can feel the inner body clearly as a single field of energy, let go, if possible, of any visual image and focus exclusively on the feeling. If you can, also drop any mental image you may still have of the physical body. All that is left then is an all-encompassing sense of presence or <em>&quot;beingness,&quot; </em>and the inner body is felt to be without a boundary. Then take your attention even more deeply into that feeling. Become one with it. Merge with the energy field, so that there is no longer a perceived duality of the observer and the observed, of you and your body. The distinction between inner and outer also dissolves now, so there is no inner body anymore. By going deeply into the body, you have transcended the body.</p><p id="5403eeaf-2641-403a-bed7-49597b182038" class="">Stay in this realm of pure Being for as long as feels comfortable; then become aware again of the physical body, your breathing and physical senses, and open your eyes. Look at your surroundings for a few minutes in a meditative way -- that is, without labeling them mentally -- and continue to feel the inner body as you do so.</p><p id="50085ca6-0d0d-4ca2-8305-eb01bde3a2e2" class="">Having access to that formless realm is truly liberating. It frees you from bondage to form and identification with form. It is life in its undifferentiated state prior to its fragmentation into multiplicity. We may call it the Unmanifested, the invisible Source of all things, the Being within all beings. It is a realm of deep stillness and peace, but also of joy and intense aliveness. Whenever you are present, you become &quot;transparent&quot; to some extent to the light, the pure consciousness that emanates from this Source. You also realize that the light is not separate from who you are but constitutes your very essence.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="f05ca1eb-178e-46ec-8564-b440330bdbb6" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Have deep roots within</summary><p id="463c03f5-0b6d-45a2-abbb-f702acd05b09" class="">The key is to be in a state of permanent connectedness with your inner body -- to feel it at all times. This will rapidly deepen and transform your life. The more consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrational frequency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up the dimmer switch and so increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energy level, negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances that reflect this higher frequency.</p><p id="7e8af838-ba34-451b-9852-187947c5259c" class="">If you keep your attention in the body as much as possible, you will be anchored in the Now. You won&#x27;t lose yourself in the external world, and you won&#x27;t lose yourself in your mind. Thoughts and emotions, fears and desires, may still be there to some extent, but they won&#x27;t take you over.</p><p id="1eaa1f60-76e6-46fb-bdab-e286700f8691" class="">Please examine where your attention is at this moment. You are listening to me, or you are reading these words in a book. That is the focus of your attention. You are also peripherally aware of your surroundings, other people, and so on. Furthermore, there may be some mind activity around what you are hearing or reading, some mental commentary. Yet there is no need for any of this to absorb <em>all </em>your attention. See if you can be in touch with your inner body at the same time. Keep some of your attention within. Don&#x27;t let it all flow out. Feel your whole body from within, as a single field of energy. It is almost as if you were listening or reading with your whole body. Let this be your practice in the days</p><p id="4ea478da-d025-4ca6-bf01-2d43bd1710d0" class="">and weeks to come.</p><p id="a316bba1-8caa-4917-91ee-9d65e5544bb7" class="">Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By all means focus on what you are doing, but feel the inner body at the same time whenever possible. Stay rooted within. Then observe how this changes your state of consciousness and the quality of what you are doing.</p><p id="dc7f1398-4c8f-4409-bea6-1b60771efacb" class="">Whenever you are waiting, wherever it may be, use that time to feel the inner body. In this way, traffic jams and line-ups become very enjoyable. Instead of mentally projecting yourself away from the Now, go more deeply into the Now by going more deeply into the body.</p><p id="a6dd9cc2-9aa2-4611-9785-0fcb999c18e0" class="">The art of inner-body awareness will develop into a completely new way of living, a state of permanent connectedness with Being, and will add a depth to your life that you have never known before.</p><p id="6f43f889-62a7-4f44-b76d-d9b893ed39a9" class="">It is easy to stay present as the observer of your mind when you are deeply rooted within your body. No matter what happens on the outside, nothing can shake you anymore.</p><p id="88ae0233-bd65-403e-9cd8-9f339ccc0fc1" class="">Unless you stay present -- and inhabiting your body is always an essential aspect of it -- you will continue to be run by your mind. The script in your head that you learned a long time ago, the conditioning of your mind, will dictate your thinking and your behavior. You may be free of it for brief intervals, but rarely for long. This is especially true when something &quot;goes wrong&quot; or there is some loss or upset. Your conditioned reaction will then be involuntary, automatic, and predictable, fueled by the one basic emotion that underlies the mind- identified</p><p id="8af70649-2a65-4929-842b-8d305ba6e602" class="">state of consciousness: fear.</p><p id="e38efb84-53d8-4671-a5be-64b30c7bbf5e" class="">So when such challenges come, as they always do, make it a habit to go within at once and focus as much as you can on the inner energy field of your body. This need not take long, just a few seconds. But you need to do it the moment that the challenge presents itself. Any delay will allow a conditioned mental- emotional reaction to arise and take you over. When you focus within and feel the inner body, you immediately become still and present as you are withdrawing consciousness from the mind. Ira response is required in that situation, it will come up from this deeper level. Just as the sun is infinitely brighter than a candle flame, there is infinitely more intelligence in Being than in your mind.</p><p id="f04c5eb0-41d2-4ca2-9dd5-083a2a056383" class="">As long as you are in conscious contact with your inner body, you are like a tree that is deeply rooted in the earth, or a building with a deep and solid foundation. The latter analogy is used by Jesus in the generally misunderstood parable of the two men who build a house. One man builds it on the sand, without a foundation, and when the storms and floods come, the house is swept away. The other man digs <em>deep </em>until he reaches the rock, then builds his house, which is not swept away by the floods.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="da088e3f-4937-4416-b463-74617981e5e8" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Before you enter the body, forgive</summary><p id="a43c5493-738e-4976-8e6a-d1e168f58212" class="">What you felt was a lingering emotion that you were probably unaware of, until you started putting some attention into the body. Unless you first give it some attention, the emotion will prevent you from gaining access to the inner body, which lies at a deeper level underneath it. Attention does not mean that you start <em>thinking </em>about it. It means to just observe the emotion, to feel it fully, and so to acknowledge and accept it as it is. Some emotions are easily identified: anger, fear, grief, and so on. Others may be much harder to label. They may just be vague feelings of unease, heaviness, or constriction, halfway between an emotion and a physical sensation. In any case, what matters is not whether you can attach a mental label to it but whether you can bring the feeling of it into awareness as much as possible. Attention is the key to transformation -- and full attention also implies acceptance. Attention is like a beam of light -- the focused power of your consciousness that transmutes everything into itself.</p><p id="58f56dc9-e104-4330-ae19-b9f9d403e055" class="">In a fully functional organism, an emotion has a very short life span. It is like a momentary ripple or wave on the surface of your Being. When you are not in your body, however, an emotion can survive inside you for days or weeks, or join with other emotions of a similar .frequency that have merged and the pain- body, a parasite that can live inside you for years, feed on your energy, lead to physical illness, and make your life miserable (see Chapter 2).</p><p id="a74e7c35-1631-471f-b232-d1e41946f4e6" class="">So place your attention on feeling the emotion, and check whether your mind is holding on to a grievance pattern such as blame, self-pity, or resentment that is feeding the emotion. If that is the case, it means that you haven&#x27;t forgiven. Nonforgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it may just as well be toward any situation or condition -- past, present or future -- that your mind refuses to accept. Yes, there can be nonforgiveness even with regard to the future. This is the mind&#x27;s refusal to accept uncertainty, to accept that the future</p><p id="3486ebbd-627a-4a17-a2c1-4c36f51d1152" class="">is ultimately beyond its control. Forgiveness is to relinquish your grievance and so to let go of grief. It happens naturally once you realize that your grievance serves no purpose except to strengthen a false sense of self. Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life -- to allow life to live through you. The alternatives are pain and suffering, a greatly restricted flow of life energy, and in many cases physical disease.</p><p id="f78024c8-18b6-4c9a-a281-1b94feac2e49" class="">The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power from the mind. Nonforgiveness is the very nature of the mind, just as the mind-made false self, the ego, cannot survive without strife and conflict. The mind cannot forgive. Only <em>you </em>can. You become present, you enter your body, you feel the vibrant peace and stillness that emanate from Being. That is why Jesus said: &quot;Before you enter the temple, forgive.&quot;</p></details></li></ul><ul id="446b47e5-3f6d-40ca-853d-dcbdde4edaee" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Salvation</summary><p id="878c1193-09a2-45f5-850e-917a3c89b211" class="">Most people pursue physical pleasures or various forms of psychological gratification because they believe that those things will make them happy or free them from a feeling of fear or lack. Happiness may be perceived as a heightened sense of aliveness attained through physical pleasure, or a more secure and more complete sense of self attained through some form of psychological gratification. This is the search for salvation from a state of unsatisfactoriness or insufficiency. Invariably, any satisfaction that they obtain is short-lived, so the condition of satisfaction or fulfillment is usually projected once again onto an imaginary point away from the here and now. &quot;When I obtain <em>this </em>or am free <em>of that -- </em>then I will be okay.&quot; This is the unconscious mind-set that creates the illusion of salvation in the future.</p><p id="1d2e3bb0-b1d0-4bf2-8f1d-df1c724a822d" class="">True salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness. It is to be who you are, to feel within you the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being that depends on nothing outside itself. It is felt not as a passing experience but as an abiding presence. In theistic language, it is to &quot;know God&quot; -- not as something outside you but as your own innermost essence. True salvation is to know yourself as an inseparable part of the timeless and formless One Life from which all that exists derives its being.</p><p id="4d8cacd9-0419-42eb-bae3-06d9f74b8de7" class="">True salvation is a state of freedom -- from fear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging. It is freedom from compulsive thinking, from negativity, and above all from past and future as a psychological need. Your mind is telling you that you cannot get there from here. Something needs to happen, or you need to become this or that before you can be free and fulfilled. It is saying, in fact, that you need time -- that you need to find, sort out, do, achieve, acquire, become, or understand something before you can be free or complete. You see time as the means to salvation, whereas in truth it is the greatest obstacle to salvation. You think that you can&#x27;t get there from where and who you are at this moment because you are not yet complete or good enough, but the truth is that here and now is the only point from where you <em>can </em>get there. You &quot;get&quot; there by realizing that you <em>are </em>there already. You find God the moment you realize that you don&#x27;t need to seek God. So there is no <em>only </em>way to salvation: Any condition can be used, but no particular condition is needed. However, there is only one point of access: the Now. There can be no salvation away from this moment. You are lonely and without a partner? Enter the Now from there. You are in a relationship? Enter the Now from there.</p><p id="c2b13149-851d-42cb-8148-4f66eed59208" class="">There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you closer to salvation than it is at this moment. This may be hard to grasp for a mind accustomed to thinking that everything worthwhile is in the future. Nor can anything that you ever did or that was done to you in the past prevent you from saying yes to what <em>is </em>and taking your attention deeply into the Now. You cannot do this in the future. You do it now or not at all.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="6acdb069-aa8d-4f41-a541-bdbcea7f6709" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Key to the Spiritual Dimension</summary><p id="968d519e-a395-4ab0-9b62-93dc3097f110" class="">In life-threatening emergency situations, the shift in consciousness from time to presence sometimes happens naturally. The personality that has a past and a future momentarily recedes and is replaced by an intense conscious presence, very still but very alert at the same time. Whatever response is needed then arises out of that state of consciousness.</p><p id="020764ca-ac08-4668-8733-232de8d31165" class="">The reason why some people love to engage in dangerous activities, such as mountain climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is that it forces them into the Now -- that intensely alive state that is free of time, free of problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping away from the present moment even for a second may mean death. Unfortunately, they come to depend on a particular activity to be in that state. But you don&#x27;t need to climb the north face of the Eiger. You can enter that state now.</p><p id="444edee9-d9fd-4904-aa7e-3a6fc5d92a38" class="">Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have pointed to the Now as the key to the spiritual dimension. Despite this, it seems to have remained a secret. It is certainly not taught in churches and temples. If you go to a church, you may hear readings from the Gospels such as &quot;Take no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself,&quot; or &quot;Nobody who puts his hands to the plow and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.&quot; Or you might hear the passage about the beautiful flowers that are not anxious about tomorrow but live with ease in the timeless Now and are provided for abundantly by God. The depth and radical nature of these teachings are not recognized. No one seems to realize that they are meant to be lived and so bring about a profound inner transformation.</p><p id="1eed7671-6f8d-470f-9c52-c04661230b0b" class="">The whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the razor&#x27;s edge of Now -- to be so utterly, so completely <em>present </em>that no problem, no suffering, nothing that is not <em>who you are </em>in your essence, can survive in you. In the Now, in the absence of time, all your problems dissolve. Suffering needs time; it cannot survive in the Now.</p><p id="ba1f3119-1bcb-4b53-88b7-e8582b4df69f" class="">The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students&#x27; attention away from time, would often raise his finger and slowly ask: &quot;What, at this moment, is lacking?&quot; A powerful question that does not require an answer on the level of the mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the Now. A similar question in the Zen tradition is this: &quot;If not now, when?&quot;</p><p id="c3b157b1-267d-4b7c-92d4-58b32a36f554" class="">The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam.

The body exists, or seems to, because you believe in death. Body and death are part of the same illusion, created by the egoic mode of consciousness, which has no awareness of the Source of life and sees itself as separate and constantly under threat. So it creates the illusion that you are a body, a dense, physical vehicle that is constantly under threat.</p><p id="0dc8c9e8-7e5f-4a91-a892-9657aa678beb" class="">To perceive yourself as a vulnerable body that was born and a little later dies -- that&#x27;s the illusion. Body and death: one illusion. You cannot have one without the other. You want to keep one side of the illusion and get rid of the other, but that is impossible. Either you keep all of it or you relinquish all of it.</p><p id="1eabc230-a51f-44fb-aeea-6d37d90f51ac" class="">However, you cannot escape from the body, nor do you have to. The body is an incredible misperception of your true nature. But your true nature is concealed somewhere within that illusion, not outside it, so the body is still the only point of access to it.</p><p id="beb1b5f6-7c1f-4a93-bf39-0e395ef027ac" class="">If you saw an angel but mistook it for a stone statue, all you would have to do is adjust your vision and look more closely at the &quot;stone statue,&quot; not start looking somewhere else. You would then find that there never was a stone statue.</p><p id="c7e82ee7-b415-44db-a874-63637a8ff499" class=""><em>If belief in death creates the body, why does an animal have a body? An animal doesn&#x27;t have an ego, and it doesn&#x27;t believe in death ....</em></p><p id="0b400eda-b8a8-49b9-9608-4fb83edc0970" class="">But it still dies, or seems to. Remember that your perception of the world is a reflection of your state of consciousness. You are not separate from it, and there</p><p id="28cee5e4-4e52-4dce-8945-4cab99edb00a" class="">is no objective world out there. Every moment, your consciousness creates the world that you inhabit. One of the greatest insights that has come out of modern physics is that of the unity between the observer and the observed: the person conducting the experiment -- the observing consciousness -- cannot be separated from the observed phenomena, and a different way of looking causes the observed phenomena to behave differently. If you believe, on a deep level, in separation and the struggle for survival, then you see that belief reflected all around you and your perceptions are governed by fear. You inhabit a world of death and of bodies fighting, killing, and devouring each other.</p><p id="3a8ec21f-5c72-4313-91ba-5df645558a2a" class="">Nothing is what it seems to be. The world that you create and see through the egoic mind may seem a very imperfect place, even a vale of tears. But whatever you perceive is only a kind of symbol, like an image in a dream. It is how your consciousness interprets and interacts with the molecular energy dance of the universe. This energy is the raw material of so-called physical reality. You see it in terms of bodies and birth and death, or as a struggle for survival. An infinite number of completely different interpretations, completely different worlds, is possible and, in fact, exists -- all depending on the perceiving consciousness. Every being is a focal point of consciousness, and every such focal point creates its own world, although all those worlds are interconnected. There is a human world, an ant world, a dolphin world, and so on. There are countless beings whose consciousness frequency is so different from yours that you are probably unaware of their existence, as they are of yours. Highly conscious beings who are aware of their connectedness with the Source and with each other would inhabit a world that to you would appear as a heavenly realm -- and yet all worlds are ultimately one.</p><p id="7733a32b-fea1-4a9c-98b5-16061e8451bc" class="">Our collective human world is largely created through the level of consciousness we call mind. Even within the collective human world there are vast differences, many different &quot;sub-worlds,&quot; depending on the perceivers or creators of their respective worlds. Since all worlds are interconnected, when collective human consciousness becomes transformed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflect that transformation. Hence the statement in the Bible that in the coming age <em>&quot;The </em>lion shall lie down with the lamb.&quot; This points to the possibility of a completely different order of reality.</p><p id="0e83c532-9344-42db-ac32-469547f5dc80" class="">The world as it appears to us now is, as I said, largely a reflection of the egoic mind. Fear being an unavoidable consequence of egoic delusion, it is a world dominated by fear. Just as the images in a dream are symbols of inner states and feelings, so our collective reality is largely a symbolic expression of fear and of the heavy layers of negativity that have accumulated in the collective human psyche. We are not separate from our world, so when the majority of humans become free of egoic delusion, this inner change will affect all of creation. You will literally inhabit a new world. It is a shift in planetary consciousness. The strange Buddhist saying that every tree and every blade of grass will eventually become enlightened points to the same truth. According to St. Paul, the whole of creation is waiting for humans to become enlightened. That is how I interpret his saying that <em>&quot;The </em>created universe is waiting with eager expectation for God&#x27;s sons to be revealed.&quot; St. Paul goes on to say that all of creation will become redeemed through this: <em>&quot;Up </em>to the present.., the whole created universe in all its parts groans as if in the pangs of childbirth.&quot;</p><p id="1c8d4178-e8fe-489e-9942-b2a7d1dbd855" class="">What is being born is a new consciousness and, as its inevitable reflection, a new world. This is also foretold in the New Testament Book of Revelation: &quot;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.&quot;</p><p id="a206128b-1f35-44e7-9f40-e7732dad11ea" class="">But don&#x27;t confuse cause and effect. Your primary task is not to seek salvation through creating a better world, but to awaken out of identification with form. You are then no longer bound to this world, this level of reality. You can feel your roots in the Unmanifested and so are free of attachment to the manifested world. You can still enjoy the passing pleasures of this world, but there is no fear of loss anymore, so you don&#x27;t need to cling to them. Although you can enjoy sensory pleasures, the craving for sensory experience is gone, as is the constant search for fulfillment through psychological gratification, through feeding the ego. You are in touch with something infinitely greater than any pleasure, greater than any manifested thing.</p><p id="41ac386d-9551-499b-ae7e-b9157b8761d7" class="">In a way, you then don&#x27;t need the world anymore. You don&#x27;t even need it to be different from the way it is.</p><p id="81d35ab2-ca9b-4754-9f44-3a4167765074" class="">It is only at this point that you begin to make a real contribution toward bringing about a better world, toward creating a different order of reality. It is only at this point that you are able to feel true compassion and to help others at the level of cause. Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world.</p><p id="cd75a980-add8-42d9-8cae-8c37135a08a4" class="">You may remember that we talked about the dual nature of true compassion, which is awareness of a common bond of shared mortality and immortality. At this deep level, compassion becomes healing in the widest sense. In that state, your healing influence is primarily based not on doing but on being. Everybody you come in contact with will be touched by your presence and affected by the peace that you emanate, whether they are conscious of it or not. When you are fully present and people around you manifest unconscious behavior, you won&#x27;t feel the need to react to it, so you don&#x27;t give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that is not peace disappears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and reaction. Animals, trees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach through being, through demonstrating the peace of God. You become the &quot;light of the world,&quot; an emanation of pure consciousness, and so you eliminate suffering on the level of cause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world.</p><p id="20b1c1e4-3719-467d-91ad-63a4cd9b2012" class="">This doesn&#x27;t mean that you may not also teach through doing -- for example, by pointing out how to disidentify from the mind, recognize unconscious patterns within oneself, and so on. But who you <em>are </em>is always a more vital teaching and a more powerful transformer of the world than what you say, and more essential even than what you do. Furthermore, to recognize the primacy of Being, and thus work on the level of cause, does not exclude the possibility that your compassion may simultaneously manifest on the level of doing and of effect, by alleviating suffering whenever you come across it. When a hungry person asks you for bread and you have some, you will give it. But as you give the bread, even though your interaction may only be very brief, what really matters is this moment of shared Being, of which the bread is only a symbol. A deep healing takes place within it. In that moment, there is no giver, no receiver.</p><p id="ebe0af5c-308a-419b-aa9b-22339d079781" class=""><em>But there shouldn&#x27;t be any hunger and starvation in the first place. How can we create a better world without tackling evils such as hunger and violence first?</em></p><p id="996a0bb3-075d-42d4-a708-8b19ede802e1" class="">All evils are the <em>effect </em>of unconsciousness. You can alleviate the effects of unconsciousness, but you cannot eliminate them unless you eliminate their cause. True change happens within, not without.</p><p id="3112e53f-b727-4171-9b73-2ba43d48162a" class="">If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that is a very noble thing to do, but remember not to focus exclusively on the outer; otherwise, you will encounter frustration and despair. Without a profound change in human consciousness, the world&#x27;s suffering is a bottomless pit. So don&#x27;t let your compassion become one-sided. Empathy with someone else&#x27;s pain or lack and a desire to help need to be balanced with a deeper realization of the eternal nature of all life and the ultimate illusion of all pain. Then let your peace flow into whatever you do and you will be working on the levels of effect and cause simultaneously.</p><p id="9bb434f1-cd5e-40d7-a3e8-f05f7c774816" class="">This also applies if you are supporting a movement designed to stop deeply unconscious humans from destroying themselves, each other, and the planet, or from continuing to inflict dreadful suffering on other sentient beings. Remember: lust as you cannot fight the darkness, so you cannot fight unconsciousness. If you try to do so, the polar opposites will become strengthened and more deeply entrenched. You will become identified with one of the polarities, you will create an &quot;enemy,&quot; and so be drawn into unconsciousness yourself. Raise awareness by disseminating information, or at the most, practice passive resistance. But make sure that you carry no resistance within, no hatred, no negativity. &quot;Love your enemies,&quot; said Jesus, which, of course, means &quot;have no enemies.&quot;</p><p id="803b0c96-cdea-4bc7-8f6d-99de93e9e869" class="">Once you get involved in working on the level of effect, it is all too easy to lose yourself in it. Stay alert and very, very present. The causal level needs to remain your primary focus, the teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and peace your most precious gift to the world.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="7280cd91-0001-4cef-8540-9d7d0cc944cf" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Concepts and Actuality</summary><p id="c6baf3d9-9aa8-4504-91ff-26197bd6c519" class="">In our daily lives, we often perceive the world and navigate our experiences through the lens of concepts. These concepts encompass a wide range of ideas, beliefs, knowledge, and personal preferences. For instance, political ideologies like communism or individual beliefs in God are examples of concepts that influence how we understand and interpret the world around us.</p><p id="890c6c8a-13ec-4fcd-a424-475548b50883" class="">The fundamental question that arises is whether these concepts hold any genuine value or significance in our day-to-day existence. Our lives primarily revolve around living, relating to others, and cooperating within society. The concepts we hold, however, exist on a more abstract plane, often creating a separation between our conceptualized ideals and the actuality of our lived experiences.</p><p id="462d216c-dbac-4f52-905f-3f0dad167931" class="">This gap between conceptual living and the lived reality leads to a critical question: Is every aspect of our existence dominated by concepts? Even our seemingly spontaneous actions may be influenced by deeply ingrained concepts and conditioning. The very act of labeling and categorizing our experiences can be seen as a manifestation of conceptualization.</p><p id="04b2cd3e-5258-48f3-b6a6-c19ddf50f5c0" class="">Despite the evolution and adaptation of concepts through experience, a fundamental division persists between our conceptualized ideals and the reality we encounter. This division gives rise to a duality—an inner conflict between what is and what should be according to our concepts.</p><p id="4fa5cbed-7a5b-4080-8ec9-7df4361ba850" class="">The process of modifying concepts based on experience is acknowledged, but it does not eliminate the underlying division between the conceptual and the actual. This perspective suggests that concepts are an inherent and inescapable part of our daily living and relationships.</p><p id="6c7e8852-8fe1-40af-9b2b-d3b06869a192" class="">However, the exploration leads to a fundamental inquiry: Is it possible to live without this gap, without constantly referring back to concepts and ideals? Can we find a way to live wholly in the present, free from the interference of conceptualization? This line of questioning points toward the pursuit of a nonconceptual way of living—one in which our actions and perceptions are in direct harmony with the unadulterated reality of each moment.</p><p id="6e242352-6bb0-4fa3-b12c-d0e720808ec2" class="">To delve deeper, a distinction is made between primary urges, such as hunger and sexuality, which are immediate and nonconceptual, and the secondary concepts and beliefs we attach to them. These secondary concepts often lead to inner conflict when they don&#x27;t align with our immediate experiences.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="d643fcf8-a0e5-455e-9f6b-3fa6d3276f35" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Dreamless Sleep</summary><p id="4f127825-c7c0-4423-940f-299fb04580e3" class="">You take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when you enter the phase of deep dreamless sleep. You merge with the Source. You draw from it the vital energy that sustains you for a while when you return to the manifested, the world of separate forms. This energy is much more vital than food: &quot;Man does not live by bread alone.&quot; But in dreamless sleep, you don&#x27;t go into it consciously. Although the bodily functions are still operating, &quot;you&quot; no longer exist in that state. Can you imagine what it would be like to go into dreamless sleep with full consciousness? It is impossible to imagine it, because that state has no content.<br/>The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it consciously. That&#x27;s why Jesus did not say: the truth will make you free, but rather: &quot;You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&quot; This is not a conceptual truth. It is the truth of eternal life beyond form, which is known directly or not at all. But don&#x27;t attempt to stay conscious in dreamless sleep. It is highly unlikely that you will succeed. At most, you may remain conscious during the dream phase, but not beyond that. This is called lucid dreaming, which may be interesting and fascinating, but it is not liberating.<br/>So use your inner body as a portal through which you enter the Unmanifested, and keep that portal open so that you stay connected with the Source at all<br/>times. It makes no difference, as far as the inner body is concerned, whether your outer physical body is old or young, frail or strong. The inner body is timeless. If you are not yet able to feel the inner body, use one of the other portals, although ultimately they are all one. Some I have spoken about at length already, but I&#x27;ll mention them again briefly here.<br/></p></details></li></ul><ul id="a44727a0-49d0-4af5-b24c-dd871d9edc7b" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Ego, Isolation, Interdependence</summary><p id="c6274421-7c84-4a16-8249-7c0ad3eeb0b3" class="">The primary principle to grasp is that the ego tends to seek isolation in various ways. When one attains great wealth or political power, they often become isolated from others. Take, for instance, someone like Adolf Hitler, who, despite his power, was profoundly alone. This isolation stems from the ego&#x27;s desire to be supreme and unchallenged. However, my perspective opposes this isolation and promotes dissolving the ego instead of isolating it. The goal is not to become an independent island but to merge with the greater whole, embracing interdependence. Isolation impedes one&#x27;s connection with reality, while participation and love lead to the highest state of SAMADHI. Religion should not be about seeking power but about finding inner peace and poverty of spirit. Understanding dependence, independence, and interdependence is crucial, as the idea of independence is a misconception. We are inherently connected to the world, just as the sun depends on us as we depend on it.</p><p id="0be4bcdd-7f74-4cd3-8a58-c6155acad4ca" class="">The misconception of interdependence as dependence must be corrected, as it leads to a desire for independence that is unattainable. We are all part of the whole, like waves in the ocean; separating them is impossible. Even a small blade of grass is significant in the grand scheme of existence. This interconnectedness defines ecology on both earthly and cosmic scales.</p><p id="407c7abb-1bdb-4c66-9909-48fbc4624aa4" class="">I advocate against isolation and renouncing the world, as it is not the world but the ego that needs renouncing. To truly let go of the ego, one must celebrate life&#x27;s moments, disappearing in moments of happiness, laughter, dancing, and love. These experiences allow us to be part of the whole, transcending the illusory separation of the ego.</p><p id="f5067adc-ce31-4abf-bc87-601b72f797bd" class="">The desire for isolated, secure places to surrender is misguided, as it breeds a false religiosity. Anger and other negative emotions are suppressed in isolation, but they resurface when one returns to the world, often more potent due to years of accumulation. The Himalayas may offer a serene environment, but it also fosters fear and prevents individuals from confronting the challenges of the real world.</p><p id="344d15a4-538c-45cf-920f-42bf07306a02" class="">Meditation should not be seen as a quantitative endeavor, but as a qualitative way of life. Meditating for countless hours is futile if meditation does not infuse every aspect of your being. SAMADHI is attained when meditation becomes your way of living, not just a practice. The key is not to avoid distractions but to accept them as part of the world&#x27;s fabric. Rejecting distractions only intensifies their power; acceptance leads to a meditative state.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="9e9aba8d-ff3f-4e39-938b-d9884ebad8e6" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Isolation and Conflict</summary><p id="b506d4d1-6d93-4b61-ae60-5d9d53bcbeee" class="">Two forms of entertainment are taking place nearby: tennis and the circus. Neither of these activities is considered entertainment in the context of politics, religion, or any form of stimulation. Therefore, it is necessary for us to collectively contemplate the events in the world and our relationship to them, as well as our actions in response to that relationship. Throughout these discussions, please keep in mind that this is not a form of entertainment in any way. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that we will collectively examine, investigate, criticize, be skeptical, and question everything the speaker says. The speaker should not become an authority figure in any sense. Quoting the speaker or blindly following them would be meaningless.</p><p id="06385d7d-6ee4-44ab-9792-42c18f749d86" class="">Therefore, it is essential to understand that the individual is not important; the speaker himself, is of no significance. What matters is that we investigate together. By &quot;together,&quot; the speaker means that we will collectively examine, question, and be critical. We must utilize our capacity to observe and doubt, never accepting what the speaker says without examination, questioning, and investigation. The goal is not to become followers of the speaker or to mindlessly quote him. Rather, we aim to exercise our capacity for clear thinking and observation to understand the world, our relationship with it, and what has happened to humanity over thousands of years.</p><p id="6d7d1d62-e398-40ff-b57c-8b454ec266a6" class="">We have evolved over millennia, accumulating a wealth of experience and knowledge. Yet, what has occurred to us as human beings? What has transpired after all these centuries? It is a crucial question to ask. We have witnessed ongoing violence, brutality, and conflict, both internally and externally, in the political, religious, economic, and interpersonal realms. Nations produce armaments and export them, even to potential adversaries, contributing to a cycle of destruction. This is the reality of humanity.</p><p id="6c5256aa-2b7b-41cc-8d4f-7974131b7f8c" class="">So, we must contemplate why we have become this way, constantly in conflict, whether politically, religiously, economically, or in our relationships with one another. People engage in hatred and mischievous actions despite the teachings of religious leaders about peace and justice. There is a lack of peace and justice globally, only war, hatred, and conflicts of ideology persist.</p><p id="f2528e4a-44f9-4030-a51c-f5d89cd7a2ca" class="">We are divided into East and West, totalitarians and democracies, with nationalistic fervor causing divisions and conflicts. This tribalism, which has persisted for thousands of years, has contributed to the perpetuation of hate and violence. We must observe this deeply and recognize that if we continue along this path, relying on time and evolution, we will perpetuate this cycle of hatred and conflict.</p><p id="22b3498b-4a11-407a-ac26-1117196894a4" class="">Tradition, which emphasizes isolationism and tribalism, has deep roots in our history. It includes war, nationalism, and isolated communities, all of which foster division. Each country prioritizes its own interests, resulting in isolation and a focus on self-preservation. This isolation extends to our individual lives, where we see ourselves as separate from others.</p><p id="4fe41fb2-da68-4d25-8559-ab5cb82b815b" class="">We must question whether we can achieve psychological transformation through time and evolution. If we continue down the same path, accepting isolation and division, we will never bring about true change. This is the central problem facing humanity: the tendency to isolate and divide ourselves, both inwardly and outwardly. We need to address this problem at its core.</p><p id="e456a85e-1946-4d7c-994d-b1eb09c422ac" class="">Our consciousness is deeply ingrained with the idea of separation, individualism, and self-centeredness. It perpetuates conflict and division. We must examine whether this separation is an illusion or a reality. Are we truly isolated from one another at the deepest level of consciousness?</p><p id="9e74296f-70bd-455f-95f9-6d9d9016aab4" class="">Our consciousness is a shared human experience. While we may differ in our outer attributes and circumstances, at the core, we share common aspects of consciousness, such as suffering, fear, and longing. Recognizing this shared consciousness is essential for understanding the human condition.</p><p id="49a58342-faab-4f70-a608-1a89ffcce4b9" class="">We must acknowledge that our isolation is a product of our own thinking. Our attachment to our beliefs, desires, and self-interests keeps us divided. Therefore, we must explore whether our consciousness can be transformed without relying on time and evolution.</p><p id="42b2f608-62ea-4de8-88ce-6b1c089b5f8f" class="">To address the root cause of our division, we must examine the role of thought. Thought creates distinctions, boundaries, and separation. It is responsible for our perception of individuality and self-interest. We have built religions, rituals, and gods through thought, all of which further divide us.</p><p id="c8859c07-c8f7-416c-9d4c-713adf5a8644" class="">If thought is the root of our division, we need to inquire into whether there is a way of living that transcends thought&#x27;s divisive nature. Love, for example, has no cause, and it unifies rather than separates. Can we find a way of living that is not based on the divisive nature of thought? This is the profound question we must explore.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="4a11e1f6-51c7-4715-abb2-61d59a728549" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Can any problem be solved in isolation?</summary><p id="38a4b902-b451-41d8-a1ac-8f5133121cc9" class="">When we encounter numerous problems, we tend to approach each one in isolation. For instance, we treat a sexual problem as if it has nothing to do with other issues. When there&#x27;s widespread starvation, we attempt to address it politically, economically, or socially without considering its connection to other problems. This raises the question: why do we try to solve each problem separately instead of recognizing their interdependence?</p><p id="109ca57d-e680-4ae7-925d-3b138ca4e8e2" class="">Violence, for example, is spreading globally in various forms. However, politicians, priests, and the established order attempt to address it in isolation, as if violence is unrelated to the rest of life. We fail to see that every problem is interconnected; they aren&#x27;t isolated issues. Violence, as we can observe in ourselves, is part of our animal inheritance. To address it effectively, we must understand the entire structure of the human being, rather than attempting to solve it in isolation, which often leads to further violence.</p><p id="0e97066e-6271-4e5c-8e4d-5bc3a162e502" class="">No problem, even though there are countless, can be solved independently. They all have relationships with one another. Trying to solve them separately only creates more division, conflict, and misery. So why do we persist in this approach? Have you ever asked yourself this question? It&#x27;s crucial to understand why our minds consistently divide and attempt to solve problems separately.</p><p id="a31648e7-d7ec-4d21-b4da-468f4abcf963" class="">Now, let&#x27;s consider the nature of thought. Thought is essential, functioning logically, objectively, and efficiently. But it also divides. It&#x27;s the product of the past, and when thought operates on a problem, it separates that problem from others. Thought divides because it&#x27;s rooted in the past, and it translates the newness of life into familiar terms, leading to further division.</p><p id="8d1d1147-a502-4aae-a0e8-e590aba7d455" class="">So, can thought ever perceive something entirely new? Can it operate without dividing life into fragments? The answer lies in comprehending the nature of thought. Thought often seeks answers within its own framework, which perpetuates separation. We need to ask whether thought can observe without the &#x27;me,&#x27; without its own agenda.</p><p id="0b50ad9d-2db2-4d87-80b3-2c0f0afc2e72" class="">Now, let&#x27;s address the urgency of change. Urgency arises when we see the danger clearly. When we recognize the danger of our fragmented approach to problems, we naturally act. Urgency is inherent in seeing, not in a desire for immediate action.</p><p id="4e309674-0498-4581-9a74-2b5c8ce21963" class="">Some might argue that living without the &#x27;me&#x27; leads to contemplation, isolation. However, we cannot live in isolation. We are always connected to the past and the world around us. Living in isolation is mere escapism, not a practical solution.</p><p id="f5f0b112-1a73-4f24-a769-5e7eb2aa991a" class="">In conclusion, we must grasp the interconnectedness of problems, understand the limitations of thought, and explore the possibility of observing life without the interference of the &#x27;me.&#x27;</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a52758c8-9331-4d59-a3b4-a76f8e6581e4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Loneliness</summary><p id="32db4d13-a6fa-4a59-9a69-4caeb717b69b" class="">THE SUN HAS gone down and the trees were dark and shapely against the darkening sky.

This path was a very ancient way; many thousands had trodden it, and it was rich in tradition and silence. It wandered among fields and mangoes, tamarinds and deserted shrines. There were large patches of garden, sweet peas deliciously scenting the air. The birds were settling down for the night, and a large pond was beginning to reflect the stars. Nature was not communicative that evening. The trees were aloof; they had withdrawn into their silence and darkness. A few chattering villagers passed by on their bicycles, and once again there was deep silence and that peace which comes when all things are alone.</p><p id="0fea864b-b4b9-43fd-96f5-cbf20f96b10d" class="">This aloneness is not aching, fearsome loneliness. It is the aloneness of being; it is uncorrupted, rich, complete. That tamarind tree has no existence other than being itself. So is the aloneness. One is alone, like the fire, like the flower, but one is not aware of its purity and of its immensity, One can truly communicate only when there is aloneness. Being alone is not the outcome of denial, of self-enclosure. Aloneness is the purgation of all motives, of all pursuits of desire, of all ends Aloneness is not an end product of the mind. You cannot wish to be alone. Such a wish is merely an escape from the pain of not being able to commune.</p><p id="1d6ee7ae-1524-4c0c-bbf5-69b79acfb67f" class="">Loneliness, with its fear and ache, is <strong>isolation</strong>, the inevitable action of the self. This process of <strong>isolation</strong>, whether expansive or narrow, is productive of confusion, conflict and sorrow. <strong>Isolation</strong> can never give birth to aloneness; the one has to cease for the other to be. Aloneness is indivisible and loneliness is separation. That which is alone is pliable and so enduring. Only the alone can commune with that which is causeless, the immeasurable. To the alone, life is eternal; to the alone there is no death. The alone can never cease to be.</p><p id="ee252eff-ef56-478e-83ed-ab715b1c69d3" class="">The moon was just coming over the tree tops, and the shadows were thick and dark. A dog began to bark as we passed the little village and walked back along the river. The river was so still that it caught the stars and the lights of the long bridge among its waters. High up on the bank children were standing and laughing, and a baby was crying. The fishermen were cleaning and coiling their nets. A night-bird flew silently by. Someone began to sing on the other bank of the wide river, and his words were clear and penetrating.

To be able really to listen, one should abandon or put aside all prejudices, preformulations and daily activities. When you are in a receptive state of mind, things can be easily understood; you are listening when your real attention is given to something. But unfortunately most of us listen through a screen of resistance. We are screened with prejudices, whether religious or spiritual, psychological or scientific; or with our daily worries, desires and fears. And with these for a screen, we listen. Therefore, we listen really to our own noise, to our own sound, not to what is being said. It is extremely difficult to put aside our training, our prejudices, our inclination, our resistance, and, reaching beyond the verbal expression, to listen so that we understand instantaneously. That is going to be one of our difficulties.</p><p id="265e663e-2899-4a16-b518-2bf7871f2582" class="">When listening to another person, don&#x27;t just listen with your mind, listen with your whole body.

You are giving the other person space - - space to be. It is the most precious gift you can give.

In the meantime, accept what <em>is. </em>Since mind and resistance are synonymous, acceptance immediately frees you from mind dominance and thus reconnects you with Being. As a result, the usual ego motivations for &quot;doing&quot; -- fear, greed, control, defending or feeding the false sense of self -- will cease to operate. An intelligence much greater than the mind is now in charge, and so a different quality of consciousness will flow into your doing.</p><p id="4c20b13c-9423-4d28-a9e2-2b1a0d9093b8" class="">&quot;Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?&quot; This was written 2000 years ago by Marcus Aurelius, one of those exceedingly rare humans who possessed worldly power as well as wisdom.</p><p id="f4176e50-d372-4e87-99a8-67fe133b1d92" class="">It seems that most people need to experience a great deal of suffering before they will relinquish resistance and accept -- before they will forgive. As soon as they do, one of the greatest miracles happens: the awakening of Being-consciousness through what appears as evil, the transmutation of suffering into inner peace. The ultimate effect of all the evil and suffering in the world is that it will force humans into realizing who they are beyond name and form. Thus, what we perceive as evil from our limited perspective is actually part of the higher good that has no opposite. This, however, does not become true for you except through forgiveness. Until that happens, evil has not been redeemed and therefore remains evil.</p><p id="eaa36f56-4b02-4358-8c9f-f4293d60fe7b" class="">Through forgiveness, which essentially means recognizing the insubstantiality of the past and allowing the present moment to be as it is, the miracle of transformation happens not only within but also without. A silent space of</p><p id="62c74eb6-63d6-4d34-a584-48ee54a847cf" class="">intense presence arises both in you and around you. Whoever or whatever enters that field of consciousness will be affected by it, sometimes visibly and immediately, sometimes at deeper levels with visible changes appearing at a later time. You dissolve discord, heal pain, dispel unconsciousness -- without <em>doing </em>anything -- simply by <em>being </em>and holding that frequency of intense presence.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="e833ec8b-6d27-4025-9519-c5856b8db677" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Impermanence and the cycle of life</summary><p id="826aee68-ad93-444c-b21a-a6b2159f684f" class="">However, as long as you are in the physical dimension and linked to the collective human psyche, physical pain -- although rare -- is still possible. This is not to be confused with suffering, with mental- emotional pain. All suffering is ego-created and is due to resistance. Also, as long as you are in this dimension, you are still subject to its cyclical nature and to the law of impermanence of all things, but you no longer perceive this as &quot;bad&quot; -- it just <em>is.</em></p><p id="6b8062ff-708c-4d67-a94a-57cb9800d889" class="">Through allowing the &quot;isness&quot; of all things, a deeper dimension underneath the play of opposites reveals itself to you as an abiding presence, an unchanging deep stillness, an uncaused joy beyond good and bad. This is the joy of Being, the peace of God.</p><p id="9ad9a1c9-5c1b-4174-842b-b461cbcc64f8" class="">On the level of form, there is birth and death, creation and destruction, growth and dissolution, of seemingly separate forms. This is reflected everywhere: in the life cycle of a star or a planet, a physical body, a tree, a flower; in the rise and fall of nations, political systems, civilizations; and in the inevitable cycles of gain and loss in the life of an individual.</p><p id="94b50fad-fb8f-4a50-a82f-af87dd39ed58" class="">There are cycles of success, when things come to you and thrive, and cycles of failure, when they wither or disintegrate and you have to let them go in order to make room for new things to arise, or for transformation to happen. If you cling and resist at that point, it means you are refusing to go with the flow of life, and you will suffer.</p><p id="b34c05fc-a1f5-427d-9a0e-073c0dc2c22a" class="">It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle bad, except in the mind&#x27;s judgment. Growth is usually considered positive, but nothing can grow forever. If growth, of whatever kind, were to go on and on, it would eventually become monstrous and destructive. Dissolution is needed for new growth to happen. One cannot exist without the other.</p><p id="010ca27f-3c46-4a82-a623-85e3bd7433ab" class="">The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must have failed deeply on some level or experienced some deep loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension. Or perhaps your very success became empty and meaningless and so turned out to be failure. Failure lies concealed in every success, and success in every failure. In this world, which is to say on the level of form, everybody &quot;fails&quot; sooner or later, of course, and every achievement eventually comes to naught. All forms are impermanent.</p><p id="61082834-f9ed-4523-bffe-f405bed9e287" class="">You can still be active and enjoy manifesting and creating new forms and circumstances, but you won&#x27;t be identified with them. You do not need them to give you a sense of self. They are not your life -- only your life situation.</p><p id="9c1a9461-a8dd-4fc9-b1e7-cb5f81fc7b51" class="">Your physical energy is also subject to cycles. It cannot always be at a peak. There will be times of low as well as high energy. There will be periods when you are highly active and creative, but there may also be times when everything seems stagnant, when it seems that you are not getting anywhere, not achieving anything. A cycle can last for anything from a few hours to a few years. There are large cycles and small cycles within these large ones. Many illnesses are created through fighting against the cycles of low energy, which are vital for regeneration. The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self-worth and identity from external factors such as achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind. This makes it hard or impossible for you to accept the low cycles and allow them to be. Thus, the intelligence of the organism may take over as a self-protective measure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so that the necessary regeneration can take place.</p><p id="e96e54cb-b1bd-4b60-9e15-b71bd07e745f" class="">The cyclical nature of the universe is closely linked with the impermanence of all things and situations. The Buddha made this a central part of his teaching. All conditions are highly unstable and in constant flux, or, as he put it, impermanence is a characteristic of every condition, every situation you will ever encounter in your life. It will change, disappear, or no longer satisfy you. Impermanence is also central to Jesus&#x27; teaching: <em>&quot;Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.&quot;</em></p><p id="9c4f60bc-a212-4c96-9194-44d5296986e3" class="">As long as a condition is judged as &quot;good&quot; by your mind, whether it be a relationship, a possession, a social role, a place, or your physical body, the mind attaches itself to it and identifies with it. It makes you happy, makes you feel good about yourself, and it may become part of who you are or think you are. But nothing lasts in this dimension where moth and rust consume. Either it ends or it changes, or it may undergo a polarity shift: The same condition that was good yesterday or last year has suddenly or gradually turned into bad. The same condition that made you happy, then makes you unhappy. The prosperity of today becomes the empty consumerism of tomorrow. The happy wedding and honeymoon become the unhappy divorce or the unhappy coexistence. Or a condition disappears, so its absence makes you unhappy. When a condition or situation that the mind has attached itself to and identified with changes or disappears, the mind cannot accept it. It will cling to the disappearing condition and resist the change. It is almost as if a limb were being torn off your body.</p><p id="3582c59c-7a70-42df-a97a-ef4c9366ac6d" class="">We sometimes hear of people who have lost all their money or whose reputation has been mined committing suicide. Those are the extreme cases. Others, whenever a major loss of one kind or another occurs, just become deeply unhappy or make themselves ill. They cannot distinguish between their life and their life situation. I recently read about a famous actress who died in her eighties. As her beauty started to fade and became ravaged by old age, she grew desperately unhappy and became a recluse. She, too, had identified with a condition: her external appearance. First, the condition gave her a happy sense of self, then an unhappy one. If she had been able to connect with the formless and timeless life within, she could have watched and allowed the fading of her external form from a place of serenity and peace. Moreover, her external form would have become increasingly transparent to the light shining through from her ageless true nature, so her beauty would not really have faded but simply become transformed into spiritual beauty. However, nobody told her that this is possible. The most essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible.</p><p id="0493ba39-8a95-4266-8d58-13ec39af3652" class="">The Buddha taught that even your happiness is <em>dukkha </em>-- a Pali word meaning &quot;suffering&quot; or &quot;unsatisfactoriness.&quot; It is inseparable from its opposite. This means that your happiness and unhappiness are in fact one. Only the illusion of time separates them.</p><p id="734fec82-001a-4037-bf25-3659314436eb" class="">This is not being negative. It is simply recognizing the nature of thins, so that you don&#x27;t pursue an illusion for the rest of your life.</p><p id="c82fdab8-c4cd-49d7-b911-8ae02d11052b" class="">Nor is it saying that you should no longer appreciate pleasant or beautiful things or conditions. But to seek something through them that they cannot give -- an identity, a sense of permanency and fulfillment -- is a recipe for frustration and suffering. The whole advertising industry and consumer society would collapse if people became enlightened and no longer sought to find their identity through <em>things. The </em>more you seek happiness in this way, the more it will elude you. Nothing out there will ever satisfy you except temporarily and superficially, but you may need to experience many disillusionments before you realize that truth. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they will also give you pain. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they cannot give you <em>joy.</em>Nothing can <em>give </em>you joy. Joy is uncaused and arises from within as the joy of Being. It is an essential part of the inner state of peace, the state that has been called the peace of God. It is your natural state, not something that you need to work hard for or struggle to attain.</p><p id="1954e517-9502-4483-905b-4d8ce016c5cc" class="">Many people never realize that there can be no &quot;salvation&quot; in anything they do, possess, or attain. Those who do realize it often become world-weary and depressed: if nothing can give you true fulfillment, what is there left to strive for, what is the point in anything? The Old Testament prophet must have arrived at such a realization when he wrote <em>&quot;I </em>have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.&quot; When you reach this point, you are one step away from despair -- and one step away from enlightenment.</p><p id="012d7bc5-b10f-4b71-a3f8-e5ea143ea6d4" class="">A Buddhist monk once told me: &quot;All I have learned in the twenty years that I have been a monk I can sum up in one sentence: All that arises passes away. This I know.&quot; What he meant, of course, was this: I have learned to offer no resistance to what <em>is; </em>I have learned to allow the present moment to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus have I found peace.</p><p id="a5c33129-8c6b-4953-9536-4d91e4df7df0" class="">To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness. This state is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certain way, good or bad. It seems almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought you needed for your happiness now come to you with no struggle or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate them -- while they last. All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.</p><p id="b0b37833-e6fe-4f55-a4ee-4c5ce0592046" class="">The happiness that is derived from some secondary source is never very deep. It is only a pale reflection of the joy of Being, the vibrant peace that you find within as you enter the state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polar opposites of the mind and frees you from dependency on form. Even if everything were to collapse and crumble all around you, you would still feel a deep inner core of peace. You may not be happy, but you will be at peace.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="762e9508-404f-4f39-8a40-752a48bc7ba1" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Can the ego become stronger as one grows more conscious?</summary><p id="ba8b656c-e8a3-4e96-b303-258f7341e09a" class="">As awareness grows some people begin to think they’re “getting worse,” so to speak, but they’re simply becoming more conscious of what has already been there for many years. People will often ask me if they are “getting worse” because they can still detect dysfunctional or reactive patterns within themselves. It’s not as if those patterns will simply disappear as awareness grows; you’ll just be more aware of them.</p><p id="983dfeeb-db2a-412a-b954-3140d2228a6d" class="">Ultimately as you become more aware of reactive patterns, you can <em>see</em> them whereas before you <em>were</em> them. There’s a huge difference between seeing a pattern inside yourself and being the pattern—or being used by it, merging with it, or acting it out totally.</p><p id="7220f6de-3b59-4b86-9475-6f1ccad05095" class="">Conditioned patterns—or egoic behaviors, one could say—don’t go away immediately as you become present. They have their momentum—especially patterns associated with emotional residues we call “pain-body.” They may act out for quite a while, even as presence is arising.</p><p id="a7abc52c-42bd-4f12-ac21-8add34650792" class="">Usually the sequence is that after a person experiences anger—or any unconscious reaction related to the emotional body or to certain mind patterns—awareness comes in later, after the energy of the pain-body attack has subsided. This can be a while for some people; it could be an hour, two hours, three hours before you wake up and say, “what was all that?”</p><p id="35d0547d-d06d-43ec-a453-4a1f7615d362" class="">Fortunately, the time gap between the actual event and the return of awareness tends to get shorter as you become more present—and eventually it will arise immediately after it’s happened, or even while the energy is still there but no longer at its highest—at that point you’re already aware of what’s happening. And then the great step forward is when in the middle of it you become aware.</p><p id="0e374c08-9a82-4cf9-97b7-6f63fdec34ec" class="">In the middle of it, there’s already an awareness while it’s still happening. The awareness is there just at the moment the anger, for example, comes in; and just before it externalizes itself and expresses itself. When the impulse comes to be angry, the awareness is there; and at that moment then, you will have a choice in how to express it—not to keep it down—but to take one conscious breath, or walk somewhere, or simply be there as the presence and let it pass through you.</p><p id="093fd114-2c34-4f60-b4e1-3347043aef1f" class="">Then after that, you may find the impulse is not as strong as before and you notice it <em>just</em> as it comes in—and immediately you’re there as the presence. And the impulse meets the light of presence and it melts. So be patient with yourself!</p><p id="d1fc5e2a-815c-4eb5-93eb-96e889a0a47d" class="">It may also happen that as presence begins to flow into other areas of your life—your relationships and so on—the ego joins with the pain-body, so to speak. It withdraws into one corner of your life where it takes up very firm residence and says, “I’m not going from here.” It’s as if the rest of your life may be undergoing great improvement, but there’s one area in one little corner where the ego and the pain-body are taking refuge.</p><p id="4869e998-8dd5-44b8-a871-96191818bc73" class="">For example, one person in your life towards whom you harbor a strong grievance. Everything else is fine; you forgive everybody else! But there’s that <em>one</em> person, and the moment you think of that person or the name is mentioned, an enormous influx of unconsciousness takes hold of you. It doesn’t have to be a person; it could be a group of people. Or it could be about money. “I’m okay with anything, as long as nobody mentions money!”</p><p id="d4031620-5175-4074-9d2e-9347870eee4f" class="">So, whenever you discover a dysfunctional, unconscious pattern in yourself, it doesn’t mean you’ve failed; it means you’re there.

The first is what I sometimes call the “surface I”—the person with a past and a future. This is your historical identity, which is relatively fragile because the past and future only exist as thought forms or concepts in the mind. Most people on the planet are completely identified with the “surface I.”</p><p id="fe209db6-33c5-4125-a47e-1f3faf9c8056" class="">The second dimension to who you are is what I like to call the “Deep I.” The most vital realization in your lifetime is to see that in addition to being a historical person or a “surface I,” you are more fundamentally the “Deep I.” This realization frees you from looking only to the “surface I” for your ultimate sense of identity—where it can never be found. It frees you from the frustrating sense that there’s always something missing or not quite right in life.</p><p id="9429c9d4-5da1-4bff-8801-2f0ae2ec7132" class="">So, how do you realize it? You realize it in the gap between two thoughts, the space in which the historical person of the “surface I” momentarily subsides and disappears. What’s left of you is nothing that you could talk about or even understand conceptually. All you know is there is an underlying sense of presence, of being-ness, that is at once still, alert, and vitally alive. This is what it means to become aware of awareness. The practice is to invite moments of presence into your daily life so that you don’t spend your entire day dragged along by the stream of thought in the mind.</p><p id="e99bf564-84f2-469f-9b34-e5c704ddb263" class="">It’s important to recognize that the “surface I” and the “Deep I” are ultimately not separate. The “surface I” is a manifestation of consciousness in the same way that the ripple on the surface of the ocean is a manifestation of the ocean. It’s only when the ripple is unaware that it is the ocean that a sense of separateness arises—which of course is an illusion.</p><p id="1050088f-1a18-42d3-be37-1fcbba881329" class="">This realization of yourself as the “Deep I” is so freeing, so liberating, because you’re being liberated from the burden of knowing yourself only as the “surface I” and its so-called “drama.” When you realize yourself as the “Deep I,” it enables you to have a compassionate attitude toward everything that makes up the “surface I”—your physical form, your personal identity (or the historical person), the thoughts and emotions you experience, and so on. It also gives you access to true creativity and true intelligence—both of which are rooted in the formless dimension.</p><p id="f844dea0-5352-45db-8f62-dc3abe1e070b" class="">So, welcome moments of quiet and stillness into your life whenever you can. It doesn’t have to be for an hour; even a few minutes throughout the day to step out of thinking and sense yourself as the “Deep I” is enough. Over time you will live more and more continuously with an awareness of the “Deep I” in the background of your life, so to speak. And you will find it easier to maintain this awareness even when challenges arise.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="3874ad37-1c5a-4a04-9132-4d895b345046" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Ego Search for Wholeness</summary><p id="b297999e-7c33-4602-9f18-08ed989363e0" class="">Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the egoic mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole. In some</p><p id="0d8a08d0-7334-4566-b7d1-69a74afe3397" class="">people, this is conscious, in others unconscious. If it is conscious, it manifests as the unsettling and constant feeling of not being worthy or good enough. If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as an intense craving, wanting and needing. In either case, people will often enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego- gratification and things to identify with in order to fill this hole they feel within. So they strive after possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete. But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that the hole is still there, that it is bottomless. Then they are really in trouble, because they cannot delude themselves anymore. Well, they can and do, but it gets more difficult.</p><p id="1d8f30db-9ab0-4c90-820a-b714004d9051" class="">As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; you cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtained what you wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to be both defended and fed constantly. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you.</p><p id="05a14769-e429-4b0c-8e52-9ef98f250237" class="">Do you find this frightening? Or is it a relief to know this?

Perhaps you find it as yet hard to believe, and I am certainly not asking you to <em>believe </em>that your identity cannot be found in any of those things. You will <em>know the truth </em>of it for yourself. You will know it at the latest when you feel death approaching. Death is a stripping away of all that is not you.

You have already understood the basic mechanics of the unconscious state: identification with the mind, which creates a false self, the ego, as a substitute for your true self rooted in Being.

The ego, of course, loves that. It is always seeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen its illusory sense of self, and it will readily attach itself to your problems. This is why, for so many people, a large part of their sense of self is intimately connected with their problems. Once this has happened, the last thing they want is to become free of them; that would mean loss of self. There can be a great deal of unconscious ego investment in pain and suffering.</p><p id="49d40589-201a-4da8-9a38-3074f5075cc2" class="">So once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identification with the mind, which of course includes the emotions, you step out of it.

Like a man attached to old furniture, beautiful 14th-century furniture, highly polished and of great value, he is attached to that; therefore he is the furniture. So what are you attached to? Your body? If you were really attached to your body you would look after that body, eat properly, exercise properly, but you don’t. You are just attached to the idea of the body the idea but not the actual instrument. If you are attached to your wife it is because of your memories. If you are attached to her she comforts you over this and that, with all the trivialities of attachment, and death comes and you are separated.</p><p id="af0553bd-1748-428c-b001-051770a653f6" class="">So one has to inquire very closely and deeply into one’s attachment. Death does not permit one to have anything when one dies. One’s body is cremated or buried, and what has one left? One’s son, for whom one has accumulated a lot of money which he will misuse anyway. He will inherit one’s property, pay taxes and go through all the terrible anxieties of existence just as one did oneself; is that what one is attached to? Or is one attached to one’s knowledge, having been a great writer, poet or painter? Or is one attached to words because words play a tremendous part in one’s life? Just words. One never looks behind the words. One never sees that the word is not the thing, that the symbol is never the reality.</p><p id="e5c3e3ae-6ca5-4f74-b529-eb593a6ebd22" class="">Can the brain, the human consciousness, be free of this fear of death? As one is the master of psychological time, can one live with death not separating death off as something to be avoided, to be postponed, something to be put away? Death is part of life. Can one live with death and understand the meaning of ending? That is to understand the meaning of negation; ending one’s attachments, ending one’s beliefs, by negating. When one negates, ends, there is something totally new. So, while living, can one negate attachment completely? That is living with death. Death means the ending. That way there is incarnation, there is something new taking place. Ending is extraordinarily important in life to understand the depth and the beauty of negating something which is not truth. Negate, for example, one’s doubletalk. If one goes to the temple, negate the temple, so that your brain has this quality of integrity.</p><p id="7e7a4d42-90a7-4f56-8338-e51c65861908" class="">Death is an ending and has extraordinary importance in life. Not suicide, not euthanasia, but the ending of one’s attachments, one’s pride, one’s antagonism, or hatred, for another. When one looks holistically at life, then the dying, the living, the agony, the despair, the loneliness and the suffering, are all one movement. When one sees holistically there is total freedom from death not that the physical body is not going to be destroyed. There is a sense of ending, and therefore there is no continuity there is freedom from the fear of not being able to continue.</p><p id="3f2c47b4-29d0-47d5-a785-a74354297867" class="">When one human being understands the full significance of death there is the vitality, the fullness, that lies behind that understanding; he is out of the human consciousness. When you understand that life and death are one they are one when you begin to end in living then you are living side by side with death, which is the most extraordinary thing to do; there is neither the past nor the present nor the future, there is only the ending.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="fa362e52-75c3-495a-b36f-b8d6e6effed4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Conformity</summary><p id="3266c81a-b6c7-463a-b17e-c4e91c052483" class="">Conformity, often seen as the antithesis of individuality, is a complex phenomenon that permeates every aspect of human life. It is the silent force that shapes our decisions, behaviors, and even our perceptions of ourselves and the world around us. Conformity can provide a sense of belonging and security but at the cost of suppressing one&#x27;s true self and creativity.</p><h3 id="e45722db-5c1c-4dc5-9323-9ceb20ba570b" class="">The Nature of Conformity</h3><p id="726fbf14-b718-40d1-97ac-01c16c7751fb" class="">Conformity is not merely about following social norms or adhering to group expectations; it is deeply ingrained in our psychological makeup. It stems from our fundamental need for acceptance and fear of isolation. This need drives us to align our thoughts, behaviors, and even our appearance with those around us, often subconsciously. Conformity, therefore, can be seen as a survival mechanism, a way to navigate the complexities of social life.</p><h3 id="e02fa440-6132-4faa-891d-951f0a4b2869" class="">The Double-Edged Sword</h3><p id="7f7447d7-0dbc-4ffd-90a3-ebd76d492de0" class="">While conformity can offer a sense of community and reduce conflicts, it also has its dark side. It can stifle individuality, creativity, and critical thinking. The pressure to conform can lead individuals to suppress their true selves, leading to a life of dissatisfaction and unfulfilled potential. Furthermore, conformity can perpetuate harmful practices and beliefs, hindering societal progress.</p><h3 id="f3af9ac9-1bbf-4edd-b527-aeb23abedaae" class="">The Role of Fear in Conformity</h3><p id="4db9dd10-bba2-4176-9760-d512a217da8b" class="">At the heart of conformity lies fear—fear of rejection, fear of standing out, and fear of the unknown. This fear compels individuals to seek safety in the familiar, even if it means sacrificing their personal beliefs and desires. The courage to break free from conformity requires confronting these fears and embracing the uncertainty that comes with forging one&#x27;s path.</p><h3 id="5d4918e7-de3d-4e0d-a332-c65f3253476f" class="">The Quest for Authenticity</h3><p id="617ed1f5-c673-4e4f-ae2f-0b84e3005154" class="">The journey towards authenticity and self-discovery often begins with questioning the norms and values imposed by society. It involves a conscious effort to understand one&#x27;s true desires, beliefs, and values, independent of external influences. This path is not without its challenges, as it demands a willingness to face criticism, loneliness, and the discomfort of stepping out of one&#x27;s comfort zone.</p><h3 id="e5df200a-fa2a-475b-9db1-4fcb5781f4af" class="">The Role of Education and Awareness</h3><p id="9b989200-dbf2-4394-bf4a-dbc2fd1d8849" class="">Education and awareness play crucial roles in overcoming the pressures of conformity.

The beauty of non-conformity lies in its ability to celebrate diversity and foster a society where everyone has the freedom to be themselves.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="2206fb83-0676-4fbb-84a2-9484c7f5289c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Empathy</summary><p id="3ab320be-9595-4660-bea1-aa4762df4c69" class="">Empathy is a rare experience, often overshadowed by sympathy and apathy, which stand in opposition to it. To truly grasp empathy, we must transcend both sympathy and apathy.</p><p id="9cbbdfbf-3036-4f6e-8deb-18327b6ac4ae" class="">Empathy goes beyond mere understanding; it is the profound connection that dissolves the boundaries of self and other. It allows us to feel another&#x27;s thirst as our own, their hunger as our hunger, and their joy as our joy. In moments of true empathy, the separation between individuals vanishes, creating a deep sense of connectedness.</p><p id="731d9cd2-bae0-45ee-bc43-538b8bd3aecc" class="">In our daily lives, we often encounter sympathy, where we express concern for others in distress. However, beneath the surface, sympathy can sometimes conceal feelings of superiority and hidden joy in another&#x27;s misfortune. Apathy, on the other hand, is our everyday indifference to the existence of others. We pass by without acknowledging their presence, and our hearts grow colder.</p><p id="742a63a5-37c4-44b0-944f-ed788b4127b1" class="">Empathy, however, has become increasingly scarce among humans. It is the ability to connect with the life force within others, animals, and nature itself. Empathy transcends the teachings of traditional religions, which often focus on sympathy.</p><p id="95743ce4-39ed-4664-98fd-7b0c70db0437" class="">Our evolution has emphasized reason and intellect, but we have neglected our hearts. The heart, the seat of empathy, holds greater significance than the mind. It can offer what a thousand rationalities cannot.</p><p id="095c5d52-5fec-4396-b5b0-74891c08b3cb" class="">Empathy can only flourish when the mind is silent, free from incessant thoughts. Thoughts hinder sensitivity and prevent us from experiencing empathy directly. Even in love, we often say, &quot;I think I have fallen in love,&quot; reflecting our tendency to intellectualize emotions.</p><p id="fe07ee92-c001-41d6-a498-0d541ead68cb" class="">Empathy is a rare gem, seldom found. Lovers and great masters may experience it occasionally. In the relationship between a master and disciple, empathy is cultivated through the heart, leading to an unspoken understanding and oneness.</p><p id="443b4bd8-9894-40a1-9584-9dc6051b32ce" class="">Regaining empathy is essential for humanity. It connects us to the world, making us part of an infinite whole. This realization is both relaxing and profound, as it unites us with nature, the cosmos, and the beauty of existence.</p><p id="e7bfc47e-4bd0-455a-b911-a5ea597da843" class="">To attain empathy, we must undergo a subtle inner transformation akin to beheading the ego. Meditation serves as a means to empty the mind, allowing the heart to fill with empathy. By shifting our life force toward the heart, we can experience a new intensity, totality, and connectedness that was always within reach but often overlooked. Empathy is the current of life itself, waiting to be rediscovered.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="b7885448-b61b-4fc5-b9cf-38127b1ba68b" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Beauty</summary><p id="f0de3a57-bc7e-4689-bb77-87ef377cf26e" class="">The concept of beauty is a profound and essential aspect of life that goes beyond surface appearances.

While these qualities are important, they are only superficial expressions of beauty.</p><p id="22b021cd-3ac1-4e61-8dcc-4cc568d5971c" class="">True beauty lies in an inward sense of goodness and grace that transcends outward appearances. It&#x27;s a quality that arises when the mind and heart are in harmony with something lovely without hindrance. To truly appreciate beauty is to be sensitive to the world around us, to the rhythm of nature, and to the subtleties of existence.</p><p id="2b928290-5067-4eb3-bc18-e579a66fed34" class="">Superficial beauty, such as physical attractiveness and external adornments, is limited in its significance. It may create a pleasant atmosphere, but it lacks depth. Inward beauty, on the other hand, gives meaning and depth to outward form and action.

A mind free from selfishness, ambition, and fear is capable of experiencing true beauty. This kind of beauty is not related to any specific object or person; it&#x27;s a quality of the mind that appreciates the beauty in everything, from the mundane to the extraordinary.</p><p id="580e3002-b5b8-4b81-b3ca-d5591a636275" class="">To be truly religious is to be sensitive to reality, to be aware of the beauty and ugliness in the world, and to respond to it with love and goodness.

This metaphor beautifully captures the essence of compassion, illustrating how it involves a profound connection to the depth of our being, which remains untouched by the external fluctuations of life&#x27;s circumstances. This depth allows for a state of inner peace and fulfillment that does not depend on external factors, enabling an individual to engage with the world from a place of fullness rather than need.</p><p id="9d960bed-a685-4645-89dc-4fb80ce226c0" class="">Compassion is a complex, multifaceted concept that transcends the boundaries of mere emotional response to pain and loss, positioning itself as a fundamental aspect of human experience and consciousness. It is rooted in a deep understanding of sorrow, not as an individual or isolated phenomenon but as a universal and inherent aspect of human existence. This article explores the depths of compassion, its relationship with sorrow, and its transformative potential in the human psyche.</p><p id="fb915b91-eed5-4561-8c36-c826e08ca8ae" class="">This nuanced understanding of compassion reveals it as a state that goes beyond mere empathy or sympathy for another&#x27;s suffering. True compassion is rare and represents a balanced awareness of both the fragility of life and the indestructibility of our true nature. It is a state where one can fully engage with the world, appreciating its beauty and forms, without attachment, and where interactions with others are rooted in a deep sense of presence and connection to being.</p><h3 id="d60e30e6-f723-4d5a-939a-4fac09120a02" class="">Understanding Sorrow</h3><p id="082d9997-726c-4bd3-af2e-b716c8a434e7" class="">Sorrow is recognized as a profound experience that extends beyond physical pain, loss, or the immediate effects of grief. It encompasses a universal dimension, reflecting the collective suffering of humanity throughout history. This suffering is not just the sum of individual pains but a shared experience that binds all people together. It is characterized by a depth that surpasses the superficial disturbances of daily life, suggesting that sorrow and the human condition are intrinsically linked.</p><h3 id="e88b9090-4282-4f0f-9a0f-da00b07027d9" class="">The Relationship Between Sorrow and Image-Making</h3><p id="22f7663e-d9e3-458d-8eac-4548c1e1767a" class="">The process of image-making, the mental construction of self and the world, is often seen as a surface-level manifestation of deeper undercurrents of sorrow. While these images and thoughts contribute to the tapestry of human experience, they also represent the superficial aspects of a much deeper stream of consciousness. This recognition points to the interconnectedness of sorrow with our fundamental way of perceiving and interacting with the world.</p><h3 id="4d3a4496-500c-430b-b05a-72ca17228325" class="">The Emergence of Compassion</h3><p id="c38a1a41-534c-456c-9b19-46867c64e0b6" class="">Compassion arises as a natural response to the profound understanding of universal sorrow. It is not merely sympathy or empathy for the suffering of others but a deeper recognition of the shared nature of human sorrow. Compassion transcends the personal, moving beyond the self-centered emotions tied to individual experiences of pain. It emerges from a space of insight and understanding where the barriers between self and other dissolve, revealing a common ground of shared humanity.</p><h3 id="811007da-5a19-4938-881d-205c984b31f8" class="">Compassion Beyond Thought</h3><p id="d55a0aac-c806-4405-8734-270da53ffbab" class="">A pivotal aspect of compassion is its existence beyond the realm of thought and the individual ego. It is an energy that springs from a deep insight into the nature of sorrow and the limitations of thought. This energy is characterized by its timeless and boundless nature, pointing to a dimension of human experience that is sacred and untouchable by the fragmentary processes of thinking. Compassion, in this sense, becomes a transformative force, capable of altering one&#x27;s relationship with life and the world.</p><h3 id="72a5234f-d26e-4a1e-9b34-c38dded905d3" class="">The Sacred Dimension of Compassion</h3><p id="346409fe-4543-4746-b376-a6a75578f836" class="">Compassion opens the door to a sacred dimension of existence, where life is revered as a profound and interconnected whole. This sacredness is not derived from religious or dogmatic beliefs but from a deep, intuitive understanding of the interconnectedness of all life.

It allows for true relationships to emerge, where the physical and mental forms of individuals are seen not as barriers but as gateways to recognizing the shared essence of being. This perspective fosters a genuine connection that goes beyond the superficial likes and dislikes dictated by the mind, enabling a direct perception of another&#x27;s true reality as well as one&#x27;s own. In this space, compassion becomes a bridge between beings, allowing for a recognition of shared suffering and the illusion it represents when identified with form.</p><h3 id="92d0e261-f702-41ec-9b96-5ef3a73d1248" class="">Compassion and the Recognition of Mortality</h3><p id="22750148-6107-444f-a201-39f8a8806448" class="">Compassion also embraces the physical reality of our existence, including the shared vulnerability and mortality of all living beings. This sobering realization brings about a profound humility and equality among all creatures, highlighting the commonality of our earthly journey towards eventual dissolution. Meditating on the mortality of physical forms, including one&#x27;s own, emerges as a powerful spiritual practice that deepens the understanding of compassion. This meditation leads to the recognition of a deathless dimension within, a realization of one&#x27;s true, radiant, and awake nature that transcends the physical forms and illusions of this world.</p><h3 id="3f15809d-1453-4b01-be15-a5cc7dfaddbb" class="">The Dual Aspects of Compassion</h3><p id="3a9f5263-482d-4ea0-9c75-c0ca92c9a653" class="">True compassion encompasses both the awareness of shared mortality and the recognition of the eternal, radiant life that exists beyond form.

It arises from a complex interplay of social, environmental, and internal influences, including the society in which we are born, the culture we are raised in, and our personal experiences and attachments. This article delves into the nature of conditioning, its implications for individual and collective well-being, and the possibility of transcending it to achieve a state of unconditioned freedom and peace.</p><h3 id="051ae7aa-ab7f-4745-b343-3b8959aae84c" class="">The Nature of Conditioning</h3><p id="b7b7a7a7-9abf-466c-9479-ddab8352cffc" class="">Conditioning is not merely a passive absorption of external influences but a dynamic process that involves attachment to various objects, ideas, and identities. This attachment serves as a means of escape from our own inner emptiness, providing a sense of identity and purpose. However, this very attachment also binds us, creating a cycle of dependency and escape that reinforces our conditioning. Whether it&#x27;s attachment to work, ideologies, or personal relationships, these forms of attachment dictate our responses to the world, leading to a conditioned existence that is often marked by conflict and dissatisfaction.</p><h3 id="123f53aa-cd26-4280-88ae-ad54d1bc01fe" class="">The Role of Conflict</h3><p id="1ec0d20e-67c8-4063-b168-dddfcb522520" class="">Conflict, both external and internal, is a manifestation of conditioning. It arises when there is a lack of integration between the individual and their actions, between the challenges faced and the responses generated. This disintegration is rooted in our conditioned patterns of thinking and behaving, which are often misaligned with the realities of our existence. As long as we remain unaware of our conditioning, we continue to produce and perpetuate conflict, misunderstanding the true nature of our problems.</p><h3 id="6dd143ca-d0d1-4cbd-a4ed-4309c11bb79a" class="">The Quest for Unconditioned Freedom</h3><p id="4e0b4eb9-e576-4271-a13a-2dbed0cefd17" class="">The path to unconditioned freedom begins with an awareness of our own conditioning. This awareness is not an intellectual understanding but a direct perception of how our attachments and escapes shape our reality. By recognizing the mechanisms of our conditioning, we can start to question the necessity of our attachments and begin the process of disentangling ourselves from the web of conditioned responses.</p><h3 id="d3b913e0-d493-4328-946e-22f9849c064f" class="">The Illusion of Gradual Unconditioning</h3><p id="0d36e5d8-6c9e-49bc-ab19-cae2d7aa49c3" class="">A common misconception is that unconditioning the mind is a gradual process that requires time and deliberate effort. However, this approach itself is a product of conditioning, assuming that freedom can be achieved through accumulation of knowledge or experiences. In reality, freedom from conditioning is instantaneous, occurring the moment we fully realize and accept the limitations of our conditioned mind. It is not a state to be achieved through effort but a realization of the mind&#x27;s inherent freedom when it ceases to engage in the self-perpetuating cycle of thought and attachment.</p><h3 id="ad813245-e68e-41c9-bb23-42e56eb97f92" class="">The State of Total Awareness</h3><p id="a9510b79-c5e7-4449-900e-52dfb494eeed" class="">Total awareness involves a shift from concentrated effort to complete attention. Concentration, with its focus on a specific object or thought, often leads to conflict as it excludes other aspects of our experience. Attention, on the other hand, is a state of open awareness without choice or interpretation. This state of attention allows for a direct perception of our conditioning and its effects, leading to a profound understanding and, ultimately, the stillness of the mind. In this stillness, free from the compulsions of conditioned thought and action, lies the possibility of true peace and creativity.</p><h3 id="2e16dfaf-b483-4e02-b1b9-db14ca1f29f3" class="">The Essence of Compassion and Peace</h3><p id="a46a4c0a-ac02-48a9-bc69-b582c224f8ff" class="">True compassion and peace emerge from this state of unconditioned freedom. Compassion, in its deepest sense, is the recognition of the shared vulnerability and mortality of all beings, as well as the shared capacity for eternal, radiant life. It encompasses both the sadness and joy of existence, merging them into a deep inner peace that transcends the limitations of form and thought.

If they are religious they give it a particular slant; if they are materialistic they give it another, with a particular philosophy or theory.</strong></p><p id="85fd62fb-c3f6-400b-8797-bafe34329162" class=""><strong>So it seems very important – not only now but at all times, if one is at all serious – to find a way of life for oneself, not as a theory, but actually in daily life, a way to live without conflict of any kind at every level of one’s being. To find that out one must be serious. These meetings here are not a philosophical or religious entertainment. We are here – if we are serious, and I hope we are – to find out together a way of life not according to any particular formula or theory or principle or belief. Communication implies sharing together, creating together, working together, not merely listening to a lot of words and ideas; we are not dealing with ideas at all. So from the beginning it must be very clear that we are seriously giving our mind and heart to find out if man – if you – can live completely at peace, ending all conflict in all relationships.</strong></p><p id="8fc356b7-003d-4d95-9170-6cc628941f2e" class=""><strong>To find out, one must look at oneself not according to a particular philosophy or a particular system of thought, or from any particular religious point of view. I think one has to discard all that completely, so that one’s mind is free to observe itself in relation to society, in relation to ourselves, to our families, to our neighbour; for only then, in the observation of what is actually going on, is there a possibility of going beyond it. And I hope that is what we are going to do during these talks.</strong></p><p id="9a1acdf8-4d1c-488a-b45b-3e461f25c1b7" class=""><strong>We are not professing a new theory, a new philosophy, nor bringing a religious revelation. There is no teacher, no saviour, no master, no authority – I really mean this – because if you are going to share in what is being said, you must also put aside totally every form of authoritarian, hierarchical outlook; the mind must be free to observe. And it cannot possibly observe if you are following some system, some guide, some principle, or are tethered to any form of belief. The mind must be capable of observing. That is going to be our difficulty, because for most of us knowledge has become a dead weight, a heavy stone round our necks; it has become our habit, our conditioning. The mind that is serious must be free to observe; it must be free of this dead weight which is knowledge, experience, tradition – which is accumulated memory, the past.</strong></p><p id="c376de7d-31cc-41d0-b001-8d86de89aefa" class=""><strong>So to observe actually ‘what is’, to see the whole significance of ‘what is’, the mind must be fresh, clear, undivided. And that is going to be another problem: how to look without this division – the ‘me’ and the ‘not me’, and ‘we’ and ‘they’.</strong></p><p id="09585dfb-b1b1-4789-a592-5880330e3fcd" class=""><strong>As we said, you are observing yourself, watching yourself through the words of the speaker. So the question is: how are you to observe? I do not know if you have ever gone into that question at all. How do you look, hear, observe? – not only yourself, but the sky, the trees, the birds, your neighbour, the politician. How do you listen and observe another, how do you observe yourself? The key to this observation lies in seeing things without division. And can that ever happen? All our existence is fragmented. We are divided in ourselves, we are contradictory. We live in fragmentation – which is an actual fact. One fragment of these many fragments thinks it has the capacity to observe. Although through many associations it has assumed authority, it is still a fragment of the many fragments. And that one fragment looks and says, ‘I understand; I know what right action is.’</strong></p><p id="2903752b-82f9-44d3-af71-ee78fd51dbeb" class=""><strong>So being fragmented, broken up, contradictory, there is conflict between the various fragments. You know this as a fact, if you have observed it. And we come to the conclusion that nothing can be done about it, that nothing can be changed. How can this fragmentation be made whole? We realize that to live a harmonious, orderly, sane, healthy life, this fragmentation, this division between the ‘you’ and the ‘me’ must come to an end. But we have concluded that this is not possible – that is the dead weight of ‘what is’. So we invent theories, we wait for ‘grace’ from something divine – whatever you call it – to come and miraculously release us. Unfortunately that does not happen. Or you live in an illusion, invent some myth about the higher self, the Atman. This offers an escape.</strong></p><p id="07e4eab4-572b-4707-a87b-4ef788b2ed83" class=""><strong>We are easily persuaded to escape because we do not know how this fragmentation can be made whole. We are not talking of integration, because that implies that somebody brings about integration – one fragment bringing the other fragments together. I hope you see the difficulty of this, how we are broken up into many fragments, conscious or unconscious. And we try many ways. One of the fashionable ways is to have an analyst to do this for you; or you analyse yourself. Please do follow this carefully: there is the analyser and the thing to be analysed. We have never questioned who the analyser is. He is obviously one of the many fragments and he proceeds to analyse the whole structure of oneself. But the analyser himself, being a fragment, is conditioned. When he analyses there are several things involved. First of all, every analysis must be complete or otherwise it becomes the stone round the neck of the analyser when he begins to analyse the next incident, the next reaction. So the memory of the previous analysis increases the burden. And analysis also implies time; there are so many reactions, associations and memories to be analysed that it will take all your life. By the time you have completely analysed yourself – if that is ever possible – you are ready for the grave.</strong></p><p id="acdc5031-fc7e-450b-b328-50bfd9bd38a4" class=""><strong>That is one of our conditionings, the idea that we must analyse ourselves, look at ourselves introspectively. In the analysis there is always the censor, the one who controls, guides, shapes; there is always the conflict between the analyser and the thing to be analysed. So one has to see this – not as a theory, not as something that you have accumulated as knowledge; knowledge is excellent in its own place but not when you are trying to understand the whole structure of your being. If you use knowledge through association and accumulation, through analysis, as a means of understanding yourself, then you have stopped learning about yourself. To learn there must be freedom to observe without the censor.</strong></p><p id="0e069e13-09f0-495e-ad2b-0e88314f29c5" class=""><strong>We can see this going on in ourselves, actually, as ‘what is’, night and day, endlessly. And seeing the truth of it – the truth, not as an opinion – the futility, the mischief, the wastage of energy and time, then the whole process of analysis comes to an end. I hope you are doing this as you are listening to what is being said. Because through analysis there is the continuation of the endless chain of association; therefore one says to oneself, ‘One can never change; this conflict, this misery, this confusion is inevitable, this is the way of life.’ So one becomes mechanical, violent, brutal, and stupid. When one really observes this as a fact, one sees the truth of it; one can only see this truth when one actually sees what is going on – the ‘what is’. Do not condemn it, do not rationalize it – just observe it. And you can only observe when there is no association in your observation.</strong></p><p id="37476544-cb11-4d04-9d82-4952067c7f03" class=""><strong>As long as there is the analyser there must be the censor who brings about this whole problem of control. I do not know if you have ever realized that from the moment we are born till we die, we are always controlling ourselves. The ‘must’ and the ‘must not’, the ‘should be’ and the ‘should not’. Control implies conformity, imitation, following a particular principle, an ideal, eventually leading to that appalling thing called respectability. Why should one control at all? – which does not mean you entirely lose all control. One has to understand what is implied in control. The very process of control breeds disorder; just as the opposite – lack of control – also breeds disorder.</strong></p><p id="d12e452e-1d8c-4110-bbbd-db9a2214ae50" class=""><strong>One has to explore, understand, look at what is implied in control and see the truth of it; then one lives a life of order in which there is no control whatsoever. Disorder is brought about by this contradiction caused by the censor, the analyser, the entity that has separated himself from the various other fragments, and who is trying to impose what he thinks is right.</strong></p><p id="af4b3fdc-26fc-4682-8901-1a9c7cd003be" class=""><strong>So one has to understand this particular form of conditioning, which is: that we are all bound and shaped by control. I do not know if you ever asked yourself why you control anything at all. You do control, don’t you? Why? What makes you control? What is the root of this imitation, this conformity? Obviously one of the factors is our conditioning, our culture, our religious and social sanctions, as ‘you must do this’ and ‘not do that’. In this control there is always the will, which is a form of urgent desire that controls, that shapes, that directs. Observe this, please, as you are listening; actually observe it and you will see that something quite different comes about. We control ourselves, our tempers, our desires, our appetites, because it is always safe. There is great security in control, with all its suppressions and contradictions, with all its struggles and conflicts; there is a certain sense of safety. And also it assures us that we shall never fail.</strong></p><p id="0753819b-9a76-470b-881c-ae225279b9c4" class=""><strong>Where there is division between the controller and the thing controlled, there is no goodness. Goodness does not lie in separation. Virtue is a state of mind in which there is no separation, therefore there is no control which involves division. Control implies suppression, contradiction, effort, the demand for security – all in the name of goodness, beauty, virtue; but it is the very denial of virtue, and is therefore disorder.</strong></p><p id="c3dff916-aefd-4a47-b91a-b761ebd55f8c" class=""><strong>So can one observe without division, without the observer opposed to the thing to be observed, without the knowledge which the observer has acquired, which separates him when he looks? For the observer is the enemy of the good – though he desires order, though he attempts to bring about righteous behaviour, to live peacefully. The observer who separates himself from the thing observed is the very source of all that is not good. Do you see all this? Or are you just being casually entertained? Do you know what all this means? – that the mind is no longer analysing but actually observing, seeing directly and therefore acting directly. It means a mind in which there is no division whatsoever; it is a total, whole mind – which means being sane. It is the neurotic who has to control; when he comes to the point of having controlled himself totally, he is completely neurotic so that he cannot move, is not free.</strong></p><p id="8f593a34-6969-4c1f-aab3-c3ec76e41c38" class=""><strong>See the truth of this! The truth is not ‘what is’ – the ‘what is’ is the division, the Black and White, the Arab and the Jew, all the mess that is going on in this frightful world. Because the mind has divided itself it is not a whole, sane, healthy, holy mind. And because of this division in the mind itself, there is so much corruption, so much disorder, so much violence and brutality. So the question then is: can the mind observe without division, where the observer is the observed? To look at a tree, at a cloud, at the beauty of the lovely spring, to look at yourself, without the burden of knowledge; to look at yourself and learn at the moment of observation, without the accumulation of learning, so that the mind is free all the time to observe. It is only the young mind that learns, not the mind that is burdened with knowledge. And to learn means to observe oneself without division, without analysis, without the censor dividing the good from the bad, the what ‘should be’ from the ‘should not be’. This is one of the most important things, because if you so observe, the mind will discover that all conflict comes to an end. In that there is total goodness. It is only such a mind that can act righteously, and in that there is great joy – not the joy stimulated through pleasure.</strong></p><p id="3ddde793-b4f1-4144-8427-cfaa84a67b02" class=""><strong>I wonder if you would care to ask any questions? You must question everything, including your pet beliefs, your ideals, your authorities, your scriptures, your politicians. Which means there must be a certain quality of scepticism. But scepticism must be kept on the leash; you must let it go when necessary, so that the mind can see freely, run rapidly. When you question, it must be your own particular problem, not a casual, superficial question that will entertain you; it must be something of your own. If this is so, then you will put the right question. And if it is the right question you will have the right answer, because the very act of putting that right question shows you the answer in itself. So one must – if I may point this out – put the right question. Then in putting the right question we can both of us share, partake together, in that problem. Your problem is not different from other people’s problems. All problems are interrelated, and if you can understand one problem completely, wholly, you have understood all other problems. Therefore it is very important to put the right question. But even if it is the wrong question, you will find that in putting the wrong question you will also know when to ask the right question. You must do both: then we shall come to putting always the fundamental, real, true question.</strong></p><p id="a4a17c77-7781-43d3-9aa0-44748029ae48" class=""><strong>Questioner: Would you please define, in the context of which you were speaking, control in relation to restraint.</strong></p><p id="c5865822-9c2c-4e15-a60d-a6ffa1d46d51" class=""><strong>Krishnamurti: One has to understand the full meaning of that word ‘control’, not only according to the dictionary, but how the mind has been conditioned to control – control being suppression. In that there is the censor, the controller, the division, the conflict, the restraining, the holding, the inhibiting. When one is aware of all this, the mind then becomes very sensitive and therefore highly intelligent. We have destroyed that intelligence, which is also in the body, in the organism; we have perverted it through our pleasurable tastes and appetites. Also the mind has been shaped, controlled, conditioned through centuries by the culture, by fear, by belief. When one realizes this, not theoretically but actually, when one is aware of this, then one will find sensitivity responds intelligently without inhibition, control, suppression or restraint. But one has to understand the structure and the nature of control, which has bred so much disorder in ourselves – the will, which is the very centre of contradiction and therefore of control. Look at it, observe it in your life and you will discover all this and more. But when you make your discovery into knowledge, into some dead weight, then you are lost. Because knowledge is the accumulation of associations, an endless chain.

It signifies a state of being where our understanding fails to align with our experiences or when we are pulled in different directions by competing beliefs, desires, or obligations. Confusion, therefore, is not merely an obstacle but a signpost indicating a deeper need for inquiry and understanding.</p><h3 id="3a963f78-f976-4961-81d3-66e0643d8968" class="">The Impact of Confusion</h3><p id="18be2b84-b5a9-46d1-b37e-e279334e0a99" class="">Living in a state of confusion can be paralyzing. It can hinder our ability to make decisions, lead to feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, and trap us in a cycle of indecision and inertia. Moreover, confusion can be a source of significant emotional distress, as it often brings with it a sense of vulnerability and exposure to the unknown.</p><h3 id="d1e74e80-0757-4f08-b07a-ab3ee3096254" class="">The Root of Confusion</h3><p id="b46fd0bc-bc3f-4f92-941f-59585227cb38" class="">At the heart of confusion lies the conflict between what is and what ought to be. This conflict is fueled by our beliefs, expectations, and the ideals we hold about ourselves and the world. When reality does not conform to these preconceived notions, confusion sets in, challenging our understanding and forcing us to reevaluate our perceptions.</p><h3 id="2feb2287-6e42-4215-b9b5-fbdd8b297bc8" class="">Embracing Confusion</h3><p id="a1a3eddf-99f9-4b6c-a15a-c6d1f0260da8" class="">The first step towards navigating through confusion is to embrace it. Acknowledging the presence of confusion, without judgment or resistance, allows us to engage with it constructively. It opens the door to introspection, inviting us to examine the underlying causes and to question the beliefs and assumptions that contribute to our state of perplexity.</p><h3 id="6c07b3be-bdcc-4bd9-97bc-17313f0ef29e" class="">Seeking Clarity</h3><p id="228e405a-a9ae-4406-84c7-71c164e5cb4a" class="">The quest for clarity amidst confusion is a journey inward. It involves a deep dive into our thoughts, emotions, and the very fabric of our being. This journey requires honesty, openness, and the willingness to confront uncomfortable truths about ourselves and the world around us. Clarity emerges not from seeking definitive answers but from understanding the nature of our questions.</p><h3 id="accb21f2-2756-4a0c-a8df-4c6b0c41e831" class="">The Role of Inquiry</h3><p id="2551a244-e79b-4a87-af39-654b781d5ee2" class="">Inquiry is the compass that guides us through the fog of confusion. It is a process of questioning, exploring, and seeking understanding. Inquiry challenges us to look beyond the surface, to dismantle the structures of our beliefs, and to explore the spaces between our thoughts. Through inquiry, we learn to navigate the complexity of our inner landscape, leading us towards insights and revelations that dispel confusion.</p><h3 id="2f43f6fe-34f8-4416-8c02-8cfb6d1eeca3" class="">Moving Beyond Confusion</h3><p id="d886e90f-7b12-41e1-b64c-8cf3440acb13" class="">Moving beyond confusion does not imply the complete absence of uncertainty or ambiguity. Rather, it involves developing a relationship with confusion that is not dominated by fear or avoidance. It means cultivating a mindset that views confusion as an opportunity for growth, learning, and transformation. By embracing the unknown and the uncertain, we open ourselves to the richness of experience and the possibility of discovering new dimensions of understanding.</p><p id="ed2652e3-d098-4498-8bbb-7793eaff51c1" class="">Is it not possible, then, to be aware of everything as it is? Starting from there, surely, there can be an understanding. To acknowledge, to be aware of, to get at that which is, puts an end to struggle. If I know that I am a liar, and it is a fact which I recognize, then the struggle is over. To acknowledge, to be aware of what one is, is already the beginning of wisdom, the beginning of understanding, which releases you from time. To bring in the quality of time – time, not in the chronological sense, but as the medium, as the psychological process, the process of the mind – is destructive, and creates confusion.</p><p id="65ad023e-e1c9-4c7a-8fb9-cd924dd59f72" class="">So, we can have understanding of what is when we recognize it without condemnation, without justification, without identification. To know that one is in a certain condition, in a certain state, is already a process of liberation; but a man who is not aware of his condition, of his struggle, tries to be something other than he is, which brings about habit. So, then, let us keep in mind that we want to examine what is, to observe and be aware of exactly what is the actual, without giving it any slant, without giving it an interpretation. It needs an extraordinarily astute mind, an extraordinarily pliable heart, to be aware of and to follow what is; because what is is constantly moving, constantly undergoing a transformation, and if the mind is tethered to belief, to knowledge, it ceases to pursue, it ceases to follow the swift movement of what is. What is is not static, surely – it is constantly moving, as you will see if you observe it very closely. To follow it, you need a very swift mind and a pliable heart – which are denied when the mind is static, fixed in a belief, in a prejudice, in an identification; and a mind and heart that are dry cannot follow easily, swiftly, that which is.</p><p id="83a695e2-8147-4c8e-927d-9956c562b4e0" class="">One is aware, I think, without too much discussion, too much verbal expression, that there is individual as well as collective chaos, confusion and misery. It is not only in India, but right throughout the world; in China, America, England, Germany, all over the world, there is confusion, mounting sorrow. It is not only national, it is not particularly here, it is all over the world. There is extraordinarily acute suffering, and it is not individual only but collective. So it is a world catastrophe, and to limit it merely to a geographical area, a coloured section of the map, is absurd; because then we shall not understand the full significance of this worldwide as well as individual suffering. Being aware of this confusion, what is our response today? How do we react?</p><p id="353b1de3-9279-4803-b575-d48cf35c9ea8" class="">There is suffering, political, social, religious; our whole psychological being is confused, and all the leaders, political and religious, have failed us; all the books have lost their significance. You may go to the Bhagavad Gita or the Bible or the latest treatise on politics or psychology, and you will find that they have lost that ring, that quality of truth; they have become mere words. You yourself, who are the repeater of those words, are confused and uncertain, and mere repetition of words conveys nothing. Therefore the words and the books have lost their value; that is, if you quote the Bible, or Marx, or the Bhagavad Gita, as you who quote it are yourself uncertain, confused, your repetition becomes a lie; because what is written there becomes mere propaganda, and propaganda is not truth. So when you repeat, you have ceased to understand your own state of being. You are merely covering with words of authority your own confusion. But what we are trying to do is to understand this confusion and not cover it up with quotations; so what is your response to it? How do you respond to this extraordinary chaos, this confusion, this uncertainty of existence? Be aware of it, as I discuss it: follow, not my words, but the thought which is active in you. Most of us are accustomed to be spectators and not to partake in the game. We read books but we never write books. It has become our tradition, our national and universal habit, to be the spectators, to look on at a football game, to watch the public politicians and orators. We are merely the outsiders, looking on, and we have lost the creative capacity. Therefore we want to absorb and partake.</p><p id="15db96c5-b5ad-4ba7-9b80-51f0091bddc3" class="">But if you are merely observing, if you are merely spectators, you will lose entirely the significance of this discourse, because this is not a lecture which you are to listen to from force of habit. I am not going to give you information which you can pick up in an encyclopaedia. What we are trying to do is to follow each other’s thoughts, to pursue as far as we can, as profoundly as we can, the intimations, the responses of our own feelings. So please find out what your response is to this cause, to this suffering; not what somebody else’s words are, but how you yourself respond. Your response is one of indifference if you benefit by the suffering, by the chaos, if you derive profit from it, either economic, social, political or psychological. Therefore you do not mind if this chaos continues. Surely, the more trouble there is in the world, the more chaos, the more one seeks security. Haven’t you noticed it? When there is confusion in the world, psychologically and in every way, you enclose yourself in some kind of security, either that of a bank account or that of an ideology; or else you turn to prayer, you go to the temple – which is really escaping from what is happening in the world. More and more sects are being formed, more and more ‘isms’ are springing up all over the world. Because the more confusion there is, the more you want a leader, somebody who will guide you out of this mess, so you turn to the religious books, or to one of the latest teachers; or else you act and respond according to a system which appears to solve the problem, a system either of the left or of the right. That is exactly what is happening.</p><p id="bed9c787-9a74-4343-a73d-112fcbb98f12" class="">The moment you are aware of confusion, of exactly what is, you try to escape from it. Those sects which offer you a system for the solution of suffering, economic, social or religious, are the worst; because then system becomes important and not man – whether it be a religious system, or a system of the left or of the right. System becomes important, the philosophy, the idea, becomes important, and not man; and for the sake of the idea, of the ideology, you are willing to sacrifice all mankind, which is exactly what is happening in the world. This is not merely my interpretation; if you observe, you will find that is exactly what is happening. The system has become important. Therefore, as the system has become important, men, you and I, lose significance; and the controllers of the system, whether religious or social, whether of the left or of the right, assume authority, assume power, and therefore sacrifice you, the individual. That is exactly what is happening.</p><p id="f32f22da-a355-492e-8d3a-099e180632f8" class="">Now what is the cause of this confusion, this misery? How did this misery come about, this suffering, not only inwardly but outwardly, this fear and expectation of war, the third world war that is breaking out? What is the cause of it? Surely it indicates the collapse of all moral, spiritual values, and the glorification of all sensual values, of the value of things made by the hand or by the mind. What happens when we have no other values except the value of the things of the senses, the value of the products of the mind, of the hand or of the machine? The more significance we give to the sensual value of things, the greater the confusion, is it not? Again, this is not my theory. You do not have to quote books to find out that your values, your riches, your economic and social existence are based on things made by the hand or by the mind. So we live and function and have our being steeped in sensual values, which means that things, the things of the mind, the things of the hand and of the machine, have become important; and when things become important, belief becomes predominantly significant – which is exactly what is happening in the world, is it not?</p><p id="32556e1d-48f7-467b-94db-10a3578535b7" class="">Thus, giving more and more significance to the values of the senses brings about confusion; and, being in confusion, we try to escape from it through various forms, whether religious, economic or social, or through ambition, through power, through the search for reality. But the real is near, you do not have to seek it; and a man who seeks truth will never find it. Truth is in what is – and that is the beauty of it. But the moment you conceive it, the moment you seek it, you begin to struggle; and a man who struggles cannot understand. That is why we have to be still, observant, passively aware. We see that our living, our action, is always within the field of destruction, within the field of sorrow; like a wave, confusion and chaos always overtake us. There is no interval in the confusion of existence.</p><p id="26223a51-d4ab-486a-bbee-0c99e975af58" class="">Whatever we do at present seems to lead to chaos, seems to lead to sorrow and unhappiness. Look at your own life and you will see that our living is always on the border of sorrow. Our work, our social activity, our politics, the various gatherings of nations to stop war, all produce further war. Destruction follows in the wake of living; whatever we do leads to death. That is what is actually taking place.</p><p id="d8732588-38e9-4700-8aeb-ca77ca7f4e15" class="">Can we stop this misery at once, and not go on always being caught by the wave of confusion and sorrow? That is, great teachers, whether the Buddha or the Christ, have come; they have accepted faith, making themselves, perhaps, free from confusion and sorrow. But they have never prevented sorrow, they have never stopped confusion. Confusion goes on, sorrow goes on. If you, seeing this social and economic confusion, this chaos, this misery, withdraw into what is called the religious life and abandon the world, you may feel that you are joining these great teachers; but the world goes on with its chaos, its misery and destruction, the everlasting suffering of its rich and poor. So, our problem, yours and mine, is whether we can step out of this misery instantaneously. If, living in the world, you refuse to be a part of it, you will help others out of this chaos – not in the future, not tomorrow, but now. Surely that is our problem. War is probably coming, more destructive, more appalling in its form. Surely we cannot prevent it, because the issues are much too strong and too close. But you and I can perceive the confusion and misery immediately, can we not? We must perceive them, and then we shall be in a position to awaken the same understanding of truth in another. In other words, can you be instantaneously free? – because that is the only way out of this misery. Perception can take place only in the present; but if you say, ‘I will do it tomorrow’, the wave of confusion overtakes you, and you are then always involved in confusion.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="48cca994-b45e-4d01-81af-f9492a716b34" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Continuity</summary><p id="debe2f25-0176-4be8-a32e-01f57eae3054" class="">WE OUGHT TO talk over together the significance of death, about what is religion and meditation. Before going into all that, I wonder if one is aware of what is happening to our minds, to our brain; if one is aware of the extraordinary things that the brain, which is the seat of thought, has brought about. Technologically we have progressed, advanced so rapidly, and psychologically our behaviour, our attitudes, our actions, are more or less un-evolved. We are still aggressive, brutal, cruel, thoughtless, for thousands and thousands of years. Apparently man is still behaving more or less as he behaved 40,000 years ago. If we had that same energy, that same intensity, as one used in the technological world, if we could go very, very deeply into ourselves and go beyond ourselves, the brain has infinite capacity there too. But very few have taken that journey, very few have gone into this question whether the mind, the brain, can ever be totally free, and therefore enquire very deeply, search out what lies beyond, if there is anything beyond thought.</p><p id="8035a41b-d463-4283-9649-dee1045e4440" class="">Some of you perhaps have heard of genetic engineering. The genetic experts say that they assume a factor, a creative element, handed out from the father to the offspring, certain tendencies, qualities. They are saying, since man has not changed for thousands of years, they assume that he can be changed through genetic interference. It is a very complex question which we are not going to discuss. But we must understand what is going on, that as human beings have not deeply changed their characteristics, their way of life, their violence, they are hoping through certain chemical process and so on to change the genes, the factors that transmit certain characteristics from the father to the son. Also we should consider what is happening in the computer world. We cannot neglect all this: the genetic engineering and what is happening in the computer world. They are trying to create a mechanical intelligence, ultimate intelligence through the computer which will then think much more rapidly, more accurately, and inform the robots what they should do. This is happening already and they are trying to bring about a machine, a computer, which has ultimate intelligence.</p><p id="6d7c357e-3882-437d-a6c6-ad4bc0a9cb36" class="">So, there is on one side genetic engineering, on the other the computer acting as human beings, inventing generation after generation of computer, improving, and so on. I won’t go into all that. So what is going to happen to the human mind? What is going to happen to us when the computer can do almost everything that we do? It can meditate, it can invent gods, much better gods than yours, it can inform, educate your children far better than the present teacher, and it will create a great deal of leisure for man. Are you understanding the nature of all this, the significance of all this? That is, what is going to happen to our minds? When the computer and genetic engineering are rapidly advancing, what is going to happen to us? We would have more leisure, the computer plus the robot will do a great many things that we are doing now in our factories, in our offices, and so on. Then man will have more leisure. How will he use that leisure? Please go into this with me for a while. If the computer can out-think you, remember far more than you do, calculate with such astonishing speed and give you leisure, either you pursue the path of pleasure which is entertainment – cinemas, religious entertainments, you know all the industry of entertainment, including the gurus – or psychological search, seeking out inwardly and finding out for oneself a tremendous area that is beyond all thought. These are the only two possibilities left for us – entertainment or delving into the whole structure of the psyche and acting. Now we are asking what is our human mind, our brain. We are going to find out for ourselves.</p><p id="b9754b5f-8370-4813-8443-de8014b1f7de" class="">We first begin by asking what is the significance of death. It is the question of all humanity whether we are very young or very old. What is the meaning, the significance, of the extraordinary thing called death? Yesterday evening, we talked about several things including what is love, compassion; what is the relationship of life which is not only the whole human existence, what is its relationship to love, to death and to the whole search of man for thousands of years to find something that is beyond all thought. We have to understand the meaning of death because we are all going to die. That is absolute certainty. We are so afraid of it or we rationalize it. You say ‘yes’, I accept it, I accept death as I accept pain, as I accept sorrow, as I accept loneliness; I also accept death, which is to submit, to suffer death, to allow the whole of existence of a human being to come to an end, either through disease, through old age or through some incident. We never find out while we are living what it means to die, to understand the depth of it. You are looking at it as an incident of life, as a fact of life, as violence is a fact of life, as hatred is a fact of life. If we are at all reasonable, sane, we must look at this question of death in similar manner, not accept it, not just say it is inevitable or try to find out what lies beyond death, but to observe the nature of dying.</p><p id="d33e3f32-83dc-4e4e-9ea8-ad6da447f3e8" class="">What does death mean to most of us? Surely it means the ending, both organically and biologically, of all the things that we have held here, of all the wounds, pains, sacrifice, resistance, loneliness, despair – all that coming to an end, which means, either there is a continuity of the self, the ‘me’, or the ending of the ‘me’. We said death is an ending. You can believe in reincarnation, as most of you perhaps do. If you do, you have to ask the question, what is it that continues? Is there a continuity or is there constant change – breaking, ending, beginning? If you believe – as most people perhaps in India believe – that you are going to be reborn, then what is it that is going to be reborn? Surely not the physical body, but if you believe in that, it is a continuity of what you are now, continuity of your beliefs, your activities, your greed, and so on, that is the bundle which is the consciousness, which is the self. That self, which is essentially consciousness, is put together by thought, your greed, your envy; your religious beliefs, superstitions, your anger, and so on; all those are the activities of thought. You are the result of a continuous movement of thought. If you believe in reincarnation and all that, you must find out if it is an illusion or a reality. If you are your name, your form, your ideas, your conclusions, your experiences, are they the factors of continuity as the ‘me’ in the next life? What is that ‘me’?</p><p id="aaea2146-57b0-4da8-a88f-cf13e2d785f1" class="">Each one of us, we think, is a separate entity; we think we are so-called individuals. What is that individuality – the name, the form, what you remember, your attitudes, your loneliness, your pain, your anxiety, your chaos, your sorrow and uncertainty? You may live in a nice house or in a small room or a nice flat but you are all that. You are the bank account. When you are attached to a bank account, you are the bank account; when you are attached to a house, you are the house; when you are attached to your body, you are that. You may have lovely furniture, and it may be marvellous furniture, and if you are attached to that, you are that furniture. So you are all that. When you are attached to a chair, to a person, to an idea, to an ideal, to a personal experience, what are the implications of that attachment? Why are you attached, because death says you cannot be attached, that is the end of it. You may believe in the future, but death says you have ended, your attachment is over, your bank account is over, your guru and all your following is over.</p><p id="916b7059-eea4-4a53-8680-cd259d4a77b2" class="">So what is it that continues, that is reborn – memories, ideas? Which is what? – something dead, or is there no continuity at all? Think, search out, please. Continuity means that which is going on modifying itself. You are becoming something, and achieving it and wanting more. Continuity implies security, certainty. Are you certain about anything? Is there security in your ideas? We want continuity. We hope to have continuity because, in continuity we think there is security. One has been married for ten years, fifteen years or fifty years, there is certain continuity, but in that continuity there is conflict, misery, unhappiness, all the rest of that. So there is no continuity at all. There is constant change if you are aware of it. Either that can be superficial or a total mutation, change. That which has existed completely undergoes a change. One must find out for oneself what is the truth of this matter. One cannot be convinced by argument, by so-called evidence, and so on. One cannot be convinced of anything. One has to search out, seek and find what is true and what is illusion.</p><p id="1ec5cb24-553c-4422-a3ca-33109c58131b" class="">We have lived with this illusion that we are separate entities, whereas if you examine very closely, your consciousness, which is you is shared by all humanity. They suffer as you suffer, they are as uncertain as you are; they are lonely, miserable, confused, anxious, as you are. So your consciousness is not yours. It is the consciousness of all humanity. You are the entire humanity. It is not mere logical conclusion or observation. That is a fact. We have been trained, educated, both religiously and educationally, that we are separate individuals. We are frightened that individuality should come to an end. With such a thought, such concept as an individual, when one approached the question of death, there is immense fear of ending. But if one sees the reality, the truth that you are the rest of mankind, then what is death?</p><p id="d2507161-d628-4e22-8121-cf91e60902ed" class="">Have you ever enquired what is the nature of ending, not ending to begin something, but ending? That is, you are attached, that is a common fact; attached to your children, attached to your husband, wife, attached to something or other. Death comes along and wipes away that attachment. You cannot carry your money to heaven. You may like to have it till the last moment, but you cannot take it with you, and death says no. So can we, while living understand the nature of attachment with all its fear, jealousy, anxiety, possessive feeling; while living, be free of attachment? While you are alive, to end something voluntarily, easily without any pressure, without any reward or punishment, to end, in that there is great beauty. Then one understands the nature of freedom. In the ending, there is a beginning, something new. There is an ending, and when there is an ending, there is that feeling of total freedom from all the burden that humanity has carried for centuries. You listen to all this, smile, nod your head and agree, but you will go on being attached. That is the easiest way, the most comforting and the most painful, but you will go on. And you call that practical. Whereas, if you understand the nature of ending, you end your ambition in a very, very competitive world, understand the ending of your arrogance, your pride, your status. When this so-called organism ends, the content of consciousness of humanity goes on unless you bring about a radical change in that consciousness, a mutation, so that you are no longer in that stream of selfishness; you are no longer caught, engaged, put in the prison of attachment, uncertainty, and so on. There is a totally different way of living.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="040d67b8-2b5e-4b67-99ac-63bfb5328917" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Creativity</summary><p id="f05cdfcf-ba89-476e-bf62-c191fbce35a3" class="">What is generally called creativity is man-made – painting, music, literature, romantic and factual, all the architecture and the marvels of technology. And the painters, the writers, the poets, probably consider themselves creative. We all seem to agree with that popular idea of a creative person. Many man-made things are most beautiful, the great cathedrals, temples and mosques; some of them are extraordinarily beautiful and we know nothing of the people who built them. But now, with us, anonymity is almost gone. With anonymity there is a different kind of creativity, not based on success, money – twenty-eight million books sold in ten years!</p><p id="dd4daef4-300d-4746-9b78-dc318551c820" class="">Anonymity has great importance; in it there is a different quality; the personal motive, the personal attitude and personal opinion do not exist; there is a feeling of freedom from which there is action.</p><p id="df80ba2a-214a-47e7-bc69-49fca340f3a2" class="">But most man-made creativity, as we call it, takes place from the known. The great musicians, Beethoven, Bach and others, acted from the known. The writers and philosophers have read and accumulated; although they developed their own style they were always moving, acting or writing, from that which they had accumulated – the known. And this we generally call creativity.</p><p id="f1825c42-dc81-4da8-8768-25b2b135c2ec" class="">Is that really creative? Or is there a different kind of creativity which is born out of the freedom from the known? Because when we paint, write, or create a marvellous structure out of stone, it is based on the accumulated knowledge carried from the past to the present. Now, is there a creativity totally different from the activity that we generally call creativity?</p><p id="eb0f38ec-d0fb-498a-b923-66989e7bb93c" class="">Is there a living, is there a movement, which is not from the known? That is, is there a creation from a mind that is not burdened with all the turmoils of life, with all the social and economic pressures? Is there a creation out of a mind that has freed itself from the known?</p><p id="9f19cb4d-2e03-4ea4-89f1-a704c0f16a26" class="">Generally we start with the known and from that we create, but is there a creative impulse or movement taking place that can use the known, but not the other way round? In that state of mind, creation, as we know it, may not be necessary.</p><p id="248fd784-06de-4e1d-ba4a-3bd0cfb39f12" class="">Is creativity something totally different, something which we can all have – not only the specialist, the professional, the talented and gifted? I think we can all have this extraordinary mind that is really free from the burdens which man has imposed upon himself. Out of that sane, rational, healthy mind, something totally different comes which may not necessarily be expressed as painting, literature or architecture. Why should it? If you go into this fairly deeply, you will find that there is a state of mind which actually has no experience whatsoever. Experience implies a mind that is still groping, asking, seeking and therefore struggling in darkness and wanting to go beyond itself.</p><p id="c8f4ef52-c64b-4db4-869f-dd5bf9d51df6" class="">There is a complete and total answer to the question if we apply our minds and our hearts to it; there is a creativity which is not man-made. If the mind is extraordinarily clear without a shadow of conflict, then it is really in a state of creation; it needs no expression, no fulfilment, no publicity and such nonsense.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="5aa847bb-a673-4872-82c7-eef57eb0d344" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Dependency</summary><h3 id="a7f0cfee-c3bc-49ae-937c-41b351beb254" class="">The Quest for Shelter</h3><p id="10678df9-7be6-4e45-9e85-ea177fa00ba0" class="">At the core of our being lies a yearning for security, a quiet shelter where our sensitivity is not assaulted by the cacophony of modern existence. This yearning drives us towards dependence on others - be it family, friends, or material comforts - to provide us with a sense of safety and belonging. Yet, this very dependence, meant to shield us from our fears, becomes a source of fear itself, fear of losing those we depend on.</p><h3 id="cf81ae1d-4fda-4171-8b19-fe6e9da43bec" class="">The Vicious Cycle of Fear and Dependence</h3><p id="2b0e805a-1cbf-4797-bf5d-4529dde4d91a" class="">Dependence, while offering a temporary solace, binds us in a cycle of fear. The more we depend, the more we fear the loss of our anchors, and the tighter we cling. This cycle is perpetuated by our avoidance of confronting the emptiness within, an emptiness born of comparison and the constant measurement of ourselves against others. Our fear is not of the emptiness itself, but of facing it, of acknowledging our own insufficiency.</p><h3 id="d5da1cc0-89b6-47c4-b595-5fa776e886f8" class="">Confronting Emptiness</h3><p id="604f8ebd-c74e-4229-914d-d9aceadd42fe" class="">The conversation challenges us to confront this emptiness head-on, to cease the endless comparisons that fuel our sense of inadequacy. It asks us to consider what it means to live without psychological comparison, without constantly measuring ourselves against a societal yardstick of success and value. This inquiry leads us towards understanding that the essence of fear is not in the emptiness or in dependence, but in our flight from facing them.</p><h3 id="29215018-83ec-4fae-8cd8-e04aaa88d188" class="">Freedom from Comparison</h3><p id="06abc75f-1b99-484d-b7ac-3be7d656b540" class="">To live without psychological comparison is to step into a realm of existence where dependence and fear lose their grip. This freedom does not lead to self-sufficiency or isolation but opens us to the true nature of love. Love, in its purest form, knows no comparison, and thus, it knows no fear. It exists beyond the realms of dependence, not as a concept or an ideal, but as a lived reality.</p><h3 id="92a17e61-4ddc-4f16-935a-eb26ece3c862" class="">The Transformational Power of Love</h3><p id="8ad301bb-2cda-4990-833f-45bdc9d69f1c" class="">In this exploration, we discover that love is the antidote to fear and dependence. It is not a love that is dependent on conditions or specific outcomes but a love that is free from comparison, a love that simply is. This realization brings with it a profound transformation, a liberation from the chains of fear and dependence that bind us. It invites us to live fully, embracing both our vulnerability and our strength, in a world that no longer intimidates us with its demands and judgments.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="31d2e160-eb44-4976-9141-65cb26a50227" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Death</summary><p id="ac8ec687-cb8e-49d6-b2f6-db532e92ec81" class="">The journey from birth to death encompasses the entirety of human experience, weaving together moments of joy, sorrow, triumph, and loss.

This stance raises intriguing questions about the nature of desire and its role in our lives. Why do these texts condemn desire, and what implications does this have for those seeking a deeper understanding of their spiritual journey?</p><h3 id="6b7de796-e92e-4241-808c-c7aa17fe929e" class="">The Nature of Desire</h3><p id="8515c931-e05d-4550-91a4-5035940c3877" class="">Desire is a fundamental aspect of human experience, driving us towards various goals and aspirations. It manifests in countless forms, from the basic needs for food and shelter to more complex desires for success, love, and spiritual fulfillment. While desire can motivate positive action and personal growth, it also has the potential to lead to suffering through unfulfilled wants or conflicts between competing desires.</p><h3 id="2e971a18-64b3-41ec-b396-69c58d78f680" class="">Desire as a Source of Suffering</h3><p id="c9f9e0cd-858e-4ad3-9adc-f44f3577cbd0" class="">Many spiritual teachings highlight the transient and often illusory nature of desire. The Buddha famously identified desire as the cause of suffering, teaching that attachment to desires binds individuals to the cycle of rebirth and suffering (samsara) and that liberation (nirvana) comes from extinguishing these flames of desire. Similarly, Hindu philosophies like Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by Shankara, view desire as a hindrance to realizing the non-dual nature of reality, where individual desires are seen as stemming from ignorance of one&#x27;s true self.</p><h3 id="2e0058f8-a1cb-40a8-b32f-7be4b4fd8cce" class="">The Condemnation of Desire</h3><p id="2ad39d1a-c745-482c-9f25-99e4d79f8700" class="">The condemnation of desire in spiritual texts can be understood as a warning against the unexamined pursuit of desires that are misaligned with spiritual values or that reinforce the illusion of separateness and ego. By identifying desire as a source of suffering, these teachings urge individuals to reflect on the nature of their desires and to seek a state of being that transcends personal wants and attachments.</p><h3 id="075f50b3-1b19-4edb-884c-441b5b307dde" class="">Understanding Versus Suppressing Desire</h3><p id="79d8f784-0491-4614-a9f6-c0a2c8f44f13" class="">The key to addressing desire, as suggested by spiritual dialogues, is not necessarily through suppression or denial but through understanding its nature and origins. This involves examining the processes through which desires arise and the effects they have on one&#x27;s life and consciousness. By observing desire without judgment or attachment, individuals can gain insights into their inner workings and potentially transform their relationship with desire.</p><h3 id="44fb51f8-c090-4043-8a52-56b974abcfc3" class="">Desire and Spiritual Freedom</h3><p id="5c0537a1-e49b-48cd-9f10-be062b497f3f" class="">The path to spiritual freedom involves recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and the illusory nature of individual desires that separate us from this unity. In this context, desires are not inherently negative but become problematic when they arise from ignorance of our true nature or when they lead to attachment and suffering. Spiritual practices aim to cultivate a state of awareness where desires are seen for what they truly are—temporary and not reflective of our deepest nature.</p><h3 id="77b3fe77-d3aa-45e2-9741-0a66d9ead980" class="">The Role of Desire in Spiritual Growth</h3><p id="a5149937-3dd3-4823-9cb1-d22a0e86a10b" class="">Desire, when understood and directed mindfully, can be a powerful force for spiritual growth. The desire for truth, understanding, and liberation can motivate individuals to embark on a spiritual journey and to engage in practices that foster self-awareness and compassion. In this way, desire becomes a tool for transcending itself, guiding individuals toward a deeper realization of interconnectedness and freedom from suffering.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="af11159e-123c-4b4a-a78a-3d263bbbde81" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Doubt</summary><p id="9805b06c-8ffb-475c-bc96-d33b84dfa0f7" class="">When you are a nationalist it gives you extraordinary power to kill others. Look what they are doing! So can an illusion give you enormous vitality and strength to do extraordinary things? Apparently it does. Look what the Christian missionaries have done in the world because they believe in something. That belief may be totally unreal, an image that the mind has created, but they believe in it and are attached to it and they want to convert all the others in the world to the same belief. They put up with extraordinary discomforts, with disease and every kind of hardship. And those mystics who talk to God through prayer – I don’t know what God is, nobody knows – they have an image that there is a supreme entity and that through prayer, through faith, through dedication, through devotion, you can move mountains. Look at what America, Russia, India and all the other countries are doing. They have tremendous faith in their country, in their nationalism, and they are building a vast technological world to destroy the others, who are doing exactly the same thing. To go to the moon, what enormous energy it needed, what technological capacity, faith; the Americans first on the moon with their flag! In the Christian world faith has taken the place of doubt. Doubt is very cleansing, it purifies the mind. If you doubt your experiences, your opinions, you are free to observe clearly. In the Eastern world, in Buddhism and Hinduism, doubt is one of the major factors, it is demanded that you doubt, question, you must not accept: be a light unto yourself, a light that cannot be given to you by anyone. (Of course, now, in India and Asia it has all gone to pieces, they are just like anybody else, they are becoming merchants.) Great strength does not come through prayer, it does not come through illusion, faith; it comes through clarity, through the mind that can see clearly; and that clarity does not come and go. When you see something clearly – for instance that nationalism is the most destructive thing in the world – then you are finished with it. And the ending of that burden gives you vitality, energy, strength. Similarly if you are totally free of all attachments it gives you the strength of love, and that can do much more than all the other experiences and prayers. To escape through an illusion, through a symbol, through an ideal is an easy way out. But to see exactly what we are and go beyond demands a great deal of energy, perception and action; it is much more arduous. It means that we have to become astonishingly aware in all our activities and feelings. But we are unwilling to do all that. We think that through some easy prayer we can talk to God. God is, after all, put together by thought: the Christian God, the Hindu gods; the Buddhists have no gods but they have their own images. Is there an action not of desire? If we ask such a question, and we rarely do, one can probe, without any motive, to find an action which is of intelligence. The action of desire is not intelligent; it leads to all kinds of problems and issues. Is there an action of intelligence? One must always be somewhat sceptical in these matters; doubt is an extraordinary factor of purification of the brain, of the heart. Doubt, carefully measured out, brings great clarity, freedom. In the Eastern religions, to doubt, to question, is one of the necessities for finding truth, but in the religious culture of Western civilization, doubt is an abomination of the devil. But in freedom, in an action that is not of desire, there must be the sparkle of doubt. When one actually sees, not theoretically nor verbally, that the action of desire is corrupt, distorted, the very perception is the beginning of that intelligence from which action is totally different. That is, to see the false as the false, the truth in the false, and truth as truth. Such perception is that quality of intelligence which is neither yours nor mine, which then acts. That action has no distortion, no remorse. It doesn’t leave a mark, a footprint on the sands of time. That intelligence cannot be unless there is great compassion, love, if you will. There cannot be compassion if the activities of thought are anchored in any one particular ideology or faith, or attached to a symbol or to a person. There must be freedom to be compassionate. And where there is that flame, that very flame is the movement of intelligence.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="1f5312a4-bd9d-4107-a592-cc846dc06999" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Discipline</summary><p id="dace5fae-aa9a-4055-bf34-a69c1ec2ae36" class="">HAVE YOU EVER considered why we are disciplined, or why we discipline ourselves? Political parties all over the world insist that the party discipline be followed. Your parents, your teachers, the society around you – they all tell you that you must be disciplined, controlled. Why? And is there really any necessity for discipline at all? I know we are accustomed to think that discipline is necessary – the discipline imposed either by society, or by a religious teacher, or by a particular moral code, or by our own experience. The ambitious man who wants to achieve, who wants to make a lot of money, who wants to be a great politician – his very ambition becomes the means of his own discipline. So everyone around you says that discipline is necessary: you must go to bed and get up at a certain hour, you must study, pass examinations, obey your father and mother, and so on.</p><p id="49897e48-1582-43ed-bfb1-72694142629e" class="">Now, why should you be disciplined at all? What does discipline mean? It means adjusting yourself to something, does it not? To adjust your thinking to what other people say, to resist some forms of desire and accept others, to comply with this practice and not with that, to conform, to suppress, to follow, not only on the surface of the mind, but also deep down – all this is implied in discipline. And for centuries, age after age, we have been told by teachers, gurus, priests, politicians, kings, lawyers, by the society in which we live, that there must be discipline.</p><p id="28deb6d1-c7fe-4b87-ba0a-c2acf97d52df" class="">So, I am asking myself – and I hope you too are asking yourself – whether discipline is necessary at all, and whether there is not an entirely different approach to this problem? I think there is a different approach, and this is the real issue which is confronting not only the schools but the whole world. You see, it is generally accepted that, in order to be efficient, you must be disciplined, either by a moral code, a political creed, or by being trained to work like a machine in a factory; but this very process of discipline is making the mind dull through conformity.</p><p id="c6d84be7-4b6f-4aa9-8660-84c89c0b066a" class="">Now, does discipline set you free, or does it make you conform to an ideological pattern, whether it be the utopian pattern of communism, or some kind of moral or religious pattern? Can discipline ever set you free? Having bound you, made you a prisoner, as all forms of discipline do, can it then let you go? How can it? Or is there a different approach altogether – which is to awaken a really deep insight into the whole problem of discipline? That is, can you, the individual, have only one desire and not two or many conflicting desires? Do you understand what I mean? The moment you have two, three, or ten desires, you have the problem of discipline, have you not? You want to be rich, to have cars, houses, and at the same time you want to renounce these things because you think that to possess little or nothing is moral, ethical, religious. And is it possible to be educated in the right way so that one’s whole being is integrated, without contradiction, and therefore without the need of discipline? To be integrated implies a sense of freedom, and when this integration is taking place there is surely no need for discipline. Integration means being one thing totally on all levels at the same time.</p><p id="83864364-7f80-440a-ae52-c9d6af5bc5b4" class="">You see, if we could have right education from the very tenderest age, it would bring about a state in which there is no contradiction at all, either within or without; and then there would be no need for discipline or compulsion because you would be doing something completely, freely, with your whole being. Discipline arises only when there is a contradiction. The politicians, the governments, the organized religions want you to have only one way of thinking, because if they can make you a complete communist, a complete Catholic, or whatever it is, then you are not a problem, you simply believe and work like a machine; then there is no contradiction because you just follow. But all following is destructive because it is mechanical, it is mere conformity in which there is no creative release.</p><p id="4a768a23-69d9-4890-980b-52da8c173bc0" class="">Now, can we bring about, from the tenderest age, a sense of complete security, a feeling of being at home, so that in you there is no struggle to be this and not to be that? Because the moment there is an inward struggle there is conflict, and to overcome that conflict there must be discipline. Whereas, if you are rightly educated, then everything that you do is an integrated action; there is no contradiction and hence no compulsive action. As long as there is no integration there must be discipline, but discipline is destructive because it does not lead to freedom.</p><p id="0d70893e-cab2-49a7-b493-8fc46c9b3868" class="">To be integrated does not demand any form of discipline. That is, if I am doing what is good, what is intrinsically true, what is really beautiful, doing it with my whole being, then there is no contradiction in me and I am not merely conforming to something. If what I am doing is totally good, right in itself – not right according to some Hindu tradition or communist theory, but timelessly right under all circumstances – then I am an integrated human being and have no need for discipline. And is it not the function of a school to bring about in you this sense of integrated confidence so that what you are doing is not merely what you wish to do, but that which is fundamentally right and good, everlastingly true? you love there is no need for discipline, is there? Love brings its own creative understanding, therefore there is no resistance, no conflict; but to love with such complete integration is possible only when you feel deeply secure, completely at home, especially while you are young. This means, really, that the educator and the student must have abounding confidence in each other, otherwise we shall create a society which will be as ugly and destructive as the present one. If we can understand the significance of completely integrated action in which there is no contradiction, and therefore no need for discipline, then I think we shall bring about a totally different kind of culture, a new civilization. But if we merely resist, suppress, then what is suppressed will inevitably rebound in other directions and set going various mischievous activities and destructive events.</p><p id="ad5b5726-d220-4894-9693-678bddb5cc74" class="">So it is very important to understand this whole question of discipline. To me, discipline is something altogether ugly; it is not creative, it is destructive. But merely to stop there, with a statement of that kind, may seem to imply that you can do whatever you like. On the contrary, a man who loves does not do whatever he likes. It is love alone that leads to right action. What brings order in the world is to love and let love do what it will.</p><p id="17d2d706-9830-4f01-a270-1ed17585b0c1" class="">You are caught between these two: someone says discipline, another says no discipline. Generally what happens is that you choose what is more convenient, what is more satisfying: you like the man, his looks, his personal idiosyncrasies, his personal favouritism and all the rest of it. Putting all that aside, let us examine this question directly and find out the truth of the matter for ourselves. In this question a great deal is implied and we have to approach it very cautiously and tentatively.</p><p id="3eafefe7-dd2f-47d9-8e70-8ce46848ea13" class="">Most of us want someone in authority to tell us what to do. We look for a direction in conduct, because our instinct is to be safe, not to suffer more. Someone is said to have realized happiness, bliss or what you will and we hope that he will tell us what to do to arrive there. That is what we want: we want that same happiness, that same inward quietness, joy; and in this mad world of confusion we want someone to tell us what to do. That is really the basic instinct with most of us and, according to that instinct, we pattern our action. Is God, is that highest thing, unnameable and not to be measured by words – is that come by through discipline, through following a particular pattern of action? We want to arrive at a particular goal, particular end, and we think that by practice, by discipline, by suppressing or releasing, sublimating or substituting, we shall be able to find that which we are seeking.</p><p id="4a7ce9b9-b81d-4aa4-88c4-121d12803545" class="">What is implied in discipline? Why do we discipline ourselves, if we do? Can discipline and intelligence go together? Most people feel that we must, through some kind of discipline, subjugate or control the brute, the ugly thing in us. Is that brute, that ugly thing, controllable through discipline? What do we mean by discipline? A course of action which promises a reward, a course of action which, if pursued, will give us what we want – it may be positive or negative; a pattern of conduct which, if practised diligently, sedulously, very, very ardently, will give me in the end what I want. It may be painful but I am willing to go through it to get that. The self, which is aggressive, selfish, hypocritical, anxious, fearful – you know, all of it – that self, which is the cause of the brute in us, we want to transform, subjugate, destroy. How is this to be done? Is it to be done through discipline, or through an intelligent understanding of the past of the self, what the self is, how it comes into being, and so on? Shall we destroy the brute in man through compulsion or through intelligence? Is intelligence a matter of discipline? Let us for the time being forget what the saints and all the rest of the people have said; let us go into the matter for ourselves, as though we were for the first time looking at this problem; then we may have something creative at the end of it, not just quotations of what other people have said, which is all so vain and useless.</p><p id="b9bf3469-d8c5-4f08-ad72-3734b9fc1351" class="">We first say that in us there is conflict, the black against the white, greed against non-greed and so on. I am greedy, which creates pain; to be rid of that greed, I must discipline myself. That is I must resist any form of conflict which gives me pain, which in this case I call greed. I then say it is antisocial, it is unethical, it is not saintly and so on and so on – the various social-religious reasons we give for resisting it. Is greed destroyed or put away from us through compulsion? First, let us examine the process involved in suppression, in compulsion, in putting it away, resisting. What happens when you do that, when you resist greed? What is the thing that is resisting greed? That is the first question, isn’t it? Why do you resist greed and who is the entity that says, “I must be free of greed”? The entity that says, “I must be free” is also greed, is he not? Up to now, greed has paid him, but now it is painful; therefore he says, “I must get rid of it”. The motive to get rid of it is still a process of greed, because he is wanting to be something which he is not. Non-greed is now profitable, so I am pursuing non-greed; but the motive, the intention, is still to be something, to be non-greedy – which is still greed, surely; which is again a negative form of the emphasis on the ‘me’.</p><p id="f5346dec-e168-4054-a613-613edf42327f" class="">We find that being greedy is painful, for various reasons which are obvious. So long as we enjoy it, so long as it pays us to be greedy, there is no problem. Society encourages us in different ways to be greedy; so do religions encourage us in different ways. So long as it is profitable, so long as it is not painful, we pursue it but the moment it becomes painful we want to resist it. That resistance is what we call discipline against greed; but are we free from greed through resistance, through sublimation, through suppression? Any act on the part of the ‘me’ who wants to be free from greed is still greed. Therefore any action, any response on my part with regard to greed, is obviously not the solution.</p><p id="d209a70e-a776-4760-8cf4-e38527bb6824" class="">First of all there must be a quiet mind, an undisturbed mind, to understand anything, especially something which I do not know, something which my mind cannot fathom – which, this questioner says, is God. To understand anything, any intricate problem – of life or relationship, in fact any problem – there must be a certain quiet depth to the mind.</p><p id="8c7bba62-0eb7-4276-a2c9-2e6d97f683b8" class="">Is that quiet depth come by through any form of compulsion? The superficial mind may compel itself, make itself quiet; but surely such quietness is the quietness of decay, death. It is not capable of adaptability, pliability, sensitivity. So resistance is not the way.</p><p id="074e2170-3fa3-4523-9195-a090e5816ed9" class="">Now to see that requires intelligence, doesn’t it? To see that the mind is made dull by compulsion is already the beginning of intelligence, isn’t it? – to see that discipline is merely conformity to a pattern of action through fear. That is what is implied in disciplining ourselves: we are afraid of not getting what we want. What happens when you discipline the mind, when you discipline your being? It becomes very hard, doesn’t it; unpliable, not quick, not adjustable. Don’t you know people who have disciplined themselves – if there are such people? The result is obviously a process of decay. There is an inward conflict which is put away, hidden away; but it is there, burning.</p><p id="8faa0103-ccef-4632-b07b-6a82bbc9ecb1" class="">Thus we see that discipline, which is resistance, merely creates a habit and habit obviously cannot be productive of intelligence: habit never is, practice never is. You may become very clever with your fingers by practising the piano all day, making something with your hands; but intelligence is demanded to direct the hands and we are now inquiring into that intelligence.</p><p id="fcb779ab-d9b1-434f-9208-8001d25613f9" class="">You see somebody whom you consider happy or as having realized, and he does certain things; you, wanting that happiness, imitate him. This imitation is called discipline, isn’t it? We imitate in order to receive what another has; we copy in order to be happy, which you think he is. Is happiness found through discipline? By practising a certain rule, by practising a certain discipline, a mode of conduct, are you ever free? Surely there must be freedom for discovery, must there not? If you would discover anything, you must be free inwardly, which is obvious. Are you free by shaping your mind in a particular way which you call discipline? Obviously you are not. You are merely a repetitive machine, resisting according to a certain conclusion, according to a certain mode of conduct. Freedom cannot come through discipline. Freedom can only come into being with intelligence; and that intelligence is awakened, or you have that intelligence, the moment you see that any form of compulsion denies freedom, inwardly or outwardly.</p><p id="560243d2-af26-4529-bf2a-15e70016916e" class="">The first requirement, not as a discipline, is obviously freedom; only virtue gives this freedom. Greed is confusion; anger is confusion; bitterness is confusion. When you see that, obviously you are free of them; you do not resist them. but you see that only in freedom can you discover and that any form of compulsion is not freedom, and therefore there is no discovery. What virtue does is to give you freedom. The unvirtuous person is a confused person; in confusion, how can you discover anything? How can you? Thus virtue is not the end product of a discipline, but virtue is freedom and freedom cannot come through any action which is not virtuous, which is not true in itself. Our difficulty is that most of us have read so much, most of us have superficially followed so many disciplines – getting up every morning at a certain hour, sitting in a certain posture, trying to hold our minds in a certain way – you know, practise, practise, discipline, because you have been told that if you do these things for a number of years you will have God at the end of it. I may put it crudely, but that is the basis of our thinking. Surely God doesn’t come so easily as all that? God is not a mere marketable thing: I do this and you give me that.</p><p id="4192a22d-b285-4965-8777-9fb19c4cc98c" class="">Most of us are so conditioned by external influences, by religious doctrines, beliefs, and by our own inward demand to arrive at something, to gain something, that it is very difficult for us to think of this problem anew without thinking in terms of discipline. First we must see very clearly the implications of discipline, how it narrows down the mind, limits the mind, compels the mind to a particular action, through our desire, through influence and all the rest of it; a conditioned mind, however ‘virtuous’ that conditioning, cannot possibly be free and therefore cannot understand reality. God, reality or what you will – the name doesn’t matter – can come into being only when there is freedom, and there is no freedom where there is compulsion, positive or negative, through fear. There is no freedom if you are seeking an end, for you are tied to that end. You may be free from the past but the future holds you, and that is not freedom. It is only in freedom that one can discover anything: new idea, a new feeling, a new perception. Any form of discipline which is based on compulsion denies that freedom whether political or religious; and since discipline, which is conformity to an action with an end in view, is binding, the mind can never be free. It can function only within that groove, like a gramophone record.</p><p id="b7425275-1aaf-412c-bbe7-c08da0398220" class="">Thus through practice, through habit, through cultivation of a pattern, the mind only achieves what it has in view. Therefore it is not free; therefore it cannot realize that which is immeasurable. To be aware of that whole process – why you are constantly disciplining yourself to public opinion; to certain saints; the whole business of conforming to opinion, whether of a saint or of a neighbour, it is all the same – to be aware of this whole conformity through practice, through subtle ways of submitting yourself, of denying, asserting, suppressing, sublimating, all implying conformity to a pattern: this is already the beginning of freedom, from which there is a virtue. Virtue surely is not the cultivation of a particular idea, Non-greed, for instance, if pursued as an end is no longer virtue, is it? That is if you are conscious that you are non-greedy, are you virtuous? That is what we are doing through discipline.</p><p id="55db662e-cd9a-4599-a5a1-99751ef20dd2" class="">Discipline, conformity, practice, only give emphasis to self-consciousness as being something. The mind practises non-greed and therefore it is not free from its own consciousness as being non-greedy; therefore, it is not really non-greedy. It has merely taken on a new cloak which it calls non-greed. We can see the total process of all this: the motivation, the desire for an end, the conformity to a pattern, the desire to be secure in pursuing a pattern – all this is merely the moving from the known to the known, always within the limits of the mind’s own self-enclosing process. To see all this, to be aware of it, is the beginning of intelligence, and intelligence is neither virtuous nor non-virtuous, it cannot be fitted into a pattern as virtue or non-virtue. Intelligence brings freedom, which is not licentiousness, not disorder. Without this intelligence there can be no virtue; virtue gives freedom and in freedom there comes into being reality. If you see the whole process totally, in its entirety, then you will find there is no conflict. It is because we are in conflict and because we want to escape from that conflict that we resort to various forms of disciplines, denials and adjustments. When we see what is the process of conflict there is no question of discipline, because then we understand from moment to moment the ways of conflict. That requires great alertness, watching yourself all the time; the curious part of it is that although you may not be watchful all the time there is a recording process going on inwardly, once the intention is there – the sensitivity, the inner sensitivity, is taking the picture all the time, so that the inner will project that picture the moment you are quiet.</p><p id="972a9cbc-9645-4c77-b593-dbe82900ea1a" class="">Therefore, it is not a question of discipline. Sensitivity can never come into being through compulsion. You may compel a child to do something, put him in a corner, and he may be quiet; but inwardly he is probably seething, looking out of the window, doing something to get away. That is what we are still doing. So the question of discipline and of who is right and who is wrong can be solved only by yourself.</p><p id="b0ddd09a-d642-4e40-ab11-7552e716cef8" class="">Also, you see, we are afraid to go wrong because we want to be a success. Fear is at the bottom of the desire to be disciplined, but the unknown cannot be caught in the net of discipline. On the contrary, the unknown must have freedom and not the pattern of your mind. That is why the tranquillity of the mind is essential. When the mind is conscious that it is tranquil, it is no longer tranquil; when the mind is conscious that it is non-greedy, free from greed, it recognizes itself in the new robe of non-greed but that is not tranquillity. That is why one must also understand the problem in this question of the person who controls and that which is controlled. They are not separate phenomena but a joint phenomenon: the controller and the controlled are one.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="b8ac5a27-4e70-4233-8812-b0bd98582997" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Education</summary><p id="9396d13f-206b-462a-bc6c-584afedc46ba" class="">The essence of true education transcends the mere accumulation of knowledge and technical prowess.

This approach, while providing a certain economic utility, misses the core of what it means to be fully human. It offers an escape, a distraction from confronting the inner self, leading instead to a path of confusion and conflict. The true challenge lies in our relationships with people, ideas, and the world around us.

This striving is inherently dualistic, creating a division between the individual and the object of desire, whether it be material wealth, social status, knowledge, or even spiritual enlightenment. Such effort is fueled by the desire for gratification, for a sensation that is believed to lie in the acquisition of the desired object or state.</p><h3 id="17991cd8-ecac-4b7b-af95-904aed9735cb" class="">The Cycle of Acquisition and Conflict</h3><p id="f391e865-ed6c-4f7d-b8fb-eefcd98fe314" class="">The pursuit of gratification, whether at the material or psychological level, is a never-ending cycle. Each achievement only leads to a new desire, a new goal, and thus perpetuates the cycle of effort and conflict. This cycle is rooted in the fundamental dissatisfaction with one&#x27;s current state of being, a sense of emptiness or lack that one seeks to fill through acquisition. Yet, this very process of striving and acquiring only serves to deepen the sense of separation and dissatisfaction, leading to a state of perpetual conflict and suffering.</p><h3 id="7decdf2a-446a-41b6-bfb7-ed4ee32e31a3" class="">The Illusion of Progress</h3><p id="82586adb-399c-4558-a68f-baecd31a1d02" class="">The societal valorization of progress, of constant improvement and accumulation, masks the inherent conflict and suffering that accompany these pursuits. Effort, in this context, is seen as the engine of progress, driving individuals and societies towards ever-greater achievements. However, this progress is fundamentally flawed if it is based on the principle of acquisition, for it leads not to true happiness and fulfillment, but to an intensification of the cycle of desire and dissatisfaction.</p><h3 id="99f1c842-6a09-47e4-aad9-050f7b4ccee0" class="">The Quest for Gratification</h3><p id="65a3874f-6779-450e-a23a-cd0300d0f34c" class="">The quest for gratification through effort is essentially a quest for sensation, for an experience that is believed to lie beyond the current state. This quest can take many forms, from the pursuit of material wealth and sensory pleasures to the search for intellectual knowledge, emotional fulfillment, or spiritual enlightenment. However, at its core, it is always a pursuit of sensation, a desire to escape the present moment and the reality of one&#x27;s own being.</p><h3 id="8eb56652-6a6c-4920-beee-35faf17da66a" class="">The Path to Freedom</h3><p id="a1f0cbac-bbdb-4cdc-97aa-9d1c987f3f82" class="">True freedom, then, lies not in the pursuit of gratification through effort, but in the cessation of this pursuit. It is in the recognition that all forms of acquisition, all efforts to achieve or become something other than what one is, only lead to further conflict and suffering. Freedom comes with the understanding that happiness and fulfillment cannot be found in the external world of objects and achievements, but only in the present moment, in the acceptance of one&#x27;s own being without the desire for alteration or improvement.</p><h3 id="f2831134-f29d-44cf-accc-34c5af95b2bc" class="">The Role of Understanding</h3><p id="2564931c-b4a5-437e-8092-494d5eca51d1" class="">Understanding plays a crucial role in this process. It is not through the imposition of discipline or the pursuit of an ideal that one can find freedom, but through the deep understanding of the nature of effort, desire, and the self. This understanding is not intellectual, but experiential, arising from a direct perception of the truth of one&#x27;s own condition.</p><p id="9c06fe06-cca8-4860-bb54-d277d4438720" class="">FOR MOST OF US, our whole life is based on effort, some kind of volition. We cannot conceive of an action without volition, without effort; our life is based on it. Our social, economic and so-called spiritual life is a series of efforts, always culminating in a certain result. And we think effort is essential, necessary.</p><p id="57b72526-d356-4754-80dc-6fc69741164a" class="">Why do we make effort? Is it not, put simply, in order to achieve a result, to become something, to reach a goal? If we do not make an effort, we think we shall stagnate. We have an idea about the goal towards which we are constantly striving; and this striving has become part of our life. If we want to alter ourselves, if we want to bring about a radical change in ourselves, we make a tremendous effort to eliminate the old habits, to resist the habitual environmental influences and so on. So we are used to this series of efforts in order to find or achieve something, in order to live at all.</p><p id="c3fc989c-118d-4be9-82d8-7db97d0341e5" class="">Is not all such effort the activity of the self? Is not effort self-centred activity? If we make an effort from the centre of the self, it must inevitably produce more conflict, more confusion, more misery. Yet we keep on making effort after effort. Very few of us realize that the self-centred activity of effort does not clear up any of our problems. On the contrary, it increases our confusion and our misery and our sorrow. We know this; and yet we continue hoping somehow to break through this self-centred activity of effort, the action of the will.</p><p id="d283451a-1de3-4d9f-b48d-734488a771df" class="">I think we shall understand the significance of life if we understand what it means to make an effort. Does happiness come through effort? Have you ever tried to be happy? It is impossible, is it not? You struggle to be happy and there is no happiness, is there? Joy does not come through suppression, through control or indulgence. You may indulge but there is bitterness at the end. You may suppress or control, but there is always strife in the hidden. Therefore happiness does not come through effort, nor joy through control and suppression; and still all our life is a series of suppressions, a series of controls, a series of regretful indulgences. Also there is a constant overcoming, a constant struggle with our passions, our greed and our stupidity. So do we not strive, struggle, make effort, in the hope of finding happiness, finding something which will give us a feeling of peace, a sense of love? Yet does love or understanding come by strife? I think it is very important to understand what we mean by struggle, strife or effort.</p><p id="f3f6ece1-68b7-4be4-a5a1-64faa74355ec" class="">Does not effort mean a struggle to change what is into what is not, or into what it should be or should become? That is we are constantly struggling to avoid facing what is, or we are trying to get away from it or to transform or modify what is. A man who is truly content is the man who understands what is, gives the right significance to what is. That is true contentment; it is not concerned with having few or many possessions but with the understanding of the whole significance of what is; and that can only come when you recognize what is, when you are aware of it, not when you are trying to modify it or change it.</p><p id="f2451e35-1ec0-48b7-af11-a3acccb1bf5b" class="">So we see that effort is a strife or a struggle to transform that which is into something which you wish it to be. I am only talking about psychological struggle, not the struggle with a physical problem, like engineering or some discovery or transformation which is purely technical. I am only talking of that struggle which is psychological and which always overcomes the technical. You may build with great care a marvellous society, using the infinite knowledge science has given us. But so long as the psychological strife and struggle and battle are not understood and the psychological overtones and currents are not overcome, the structure of society, however marvellously built, is bound to crash, as has happened over and over again.</p><p id="58bd40e5-3f47-4608-87be-c2b7b275de37" class="">Effort is a distraction from what is. The moment I accept what is there is no struggle. Any form of struggle or strife is an indication of distraction; and distraction, which is effort, must exist so long as psychologically I wish to transform what is into something it is not.</p><p id="7731d591-2a6a-405f-8122-5f5dfa09a190" class="">First we must be free to see that joy and happiness do not come through effort. Is creation through effort, or is there creation only with the cessation of effort? When do you write, paint or sing? When do you create? Surely when there is no effort, when you are completely open, when on all levels you are in complete communication, completely integrated. Then there is joy and then you begin to sing or write a poem or paint or fashion something. The moment of creation is not born of struggle.</p><p id="93250a89-e066-4a4e-8d9c-1d0e1c6b6f06" class="">Perhaps in understanding the question of creativeness we shall be able to understand what we mean by effort. Is creativeness the outcome of effort, and are we aware in those moments when we are creative? Or is creativeness a sense of total self-forgetfulness, that sense when there is no turmoil, when one is wholly unaware of the movement of thought, when there is only a complete, full, rich being? Is that state the result of travail, of struggle, of conflict, of effort? I do not know if you have ever noticed that when you do something easily, swiftly, there is no effort, there is complete absence of struggle; but as our lives are mostly a series of battles, conflicts and struggles, we cannot imagine a life, a state of being, in which strife has fully ceased.</p><p id="30303005-0e54-4af9-a194-8c7aa7998762" class="">To understand the state of being without strife, that state of creative existence, surely one must inquire into the whole problem of effort. We mean by effort the striving to fulfil oneself, to become something, don’t we? I am this, and I want to become that; I am not that, and I must become that. In becoming ‘that’, there is strife, there is battle, conflict, struggle. In this struggle we are concerned inevitably with fulfilment through the gaining of an end; we seek self-fulfilment in an object, in a person, in an idea, and that demands constant battle, struggle, the effort to become, to fulfil. So we have taken this effort as inevitable; and I wonder if it is inevitable – this struggle to become something? Why is there this struggle? Where there is the desire for fulfilment, in whatever degree and at whatever level, there must be struggle. Fulfilment is the motive, the drive behind the effort; whether it is in the big executive, the housewife, or a poor man, there is this battle to become, to fulfil, going on.</p><p id="e1e2cd1f-18c7-4995-bb87-342cb121fc22" class="">Now why is there the desire to fulfil oneself? Obviously, the desire to fulfil, to become something, arises when there is awareness of being nothing. Because I am nothing, because I am insufficient, empty, inwardly poor, I struggle to become something; outwardly or inwardly I struggle to fulfil myself in a person, in a thing, in an idea. To fill that void is the whole process of our existence. Being aware that we are empty, inwardly poor, we struggle either to collect things outwardly, or to cultivate inward riches. There is effort only when there is an escape from that inward void through action, through contemplation, through acquisition, through achievement, through power, and so on. That is our daily existence. I am aware of my insufficiency, my inward poverty, and I struggle to run away from it or to fill it. This running away, avoiding, or trying to cover up the void, entails struggle, strife, effort.</p><p id="456b649a-39bc-4d51-87f9-42fa81ae243e" class="">Now if one does not make an effort to run away, what happens? One lives with that loneliness, that emptiness; and in accepting that emptiness one will find that there comes a creative state which has nothing to do with strife, with effort. Effort exists only so long as we are trying to avoid that inward loneliness, emptiness, but when we look at it, observe it, when we accept what is without avoidance, we will find there comes a state of being in which all strife ceases. That state of being is creativeness and it is not the result of strife.</p><p id="6d2cd955-380e-44d5-bd9a-9439404c052f" class="">But when there is understanding of what is, which is emptiness, inward insufficiency, when one lives with that insufficiency and understands it fully, there comes creative reality, creative intelligence, which alone brings happiness.</p><p id="f78e5229-2b74-447e-baf4-8c1298c31f8c" class="">Therefore action as we know it is really reaction, it is a ceaseless becoming, which is the denial, the avoidance of what is; but when there is awareness of emptiness without choice, without condemnation or justification, then in that understanding of what is there is action, and this action is creative being. You will understand this if you are aware of yourself in action. Observe yourself as you are acting, not only outwardly but see also the movement of your thought and feeling. When you are aware of this movement you will see that the thought process, which is also feeling and action, is based on an idea of becoming. The idea of becom1ng arises only when there is a sense of insecurity, and that sense of insecurity comes when one is aware of the inward void. If you are aware of that process of thought and feeling, you will see that there is a constant battle going on, an effort to change, to modify, to alter what is. This is the effort to become, and becoming is a direct avoidance of what is. Through self-knowledge, through constant awareness, you will find that strife, battle, the conflict of becoming, leads to pain, to sorrow and ignorance. It is only if you are aware of inward insufficiency and live with it without escape, accepting it wholly, that you will discover an extraordinary tranquillity, a tranquillity which is not put together, made up, but a tranquillity which comes with understanding of what is. Only in that state of tranquillity is there creative being.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="001d52af-bb30-4960-b562-74f933b79c63" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Emotions</summary><p id="e852f4cd-25ce-4e3c-87da-a26450b4d32e" class="">Why do we name anything? Why do we give a label to a flower, to a person, to a feeling? Either to communicate one’s feelings, to describe the flower and so on and so on; or to identify oneself with that feeling. Is not that so? I name something, a feeling, to communicate it. ‘I am angry.’ Or I identify myself with that feeling in order to strengthen it or to dissolve it or to do something about 1t. We give a name to something, to a rose, to communicate it to others or, by giving it a name, we think we have understood it. We say, “That is a rose”, rapidly look at it and go on. By giving it a name, we think we have understood it; we have classified it and think that thereby we have understood the whole content and beauty of that flower.</p><p id="01f149d2-40d1-4f65-b9d7-bc994648d4b5" class="">By giving a name to something, we have merely put it into a category and we think we have understood it; we don’t look at it more closely. If we do not give it a name, however, we are forced to look at it. That is we approach the flower or whatever it is with a newness, with a new quality of examination; we look at it as though we had never looked at it before. Naming is a very convenient way of disposing of things and of people – by saying that they are Germans, Japanese, Americans, Hindus, you can give them a label and destroy the label. If you do not give a label to people you are forced to look at them and then it is much more difficult to kill somebody. You can destroy the label with a bomb and feel righteous, but if you do not give a label and must therefore look at the individual thing – whether it is a man or a flower or an incident or an emotion – then you are forced to consider your relationship with it, and with the action following. So terming or giving a label is a very convenient way of disposing of anything, of denying, condemning or justifying it. That is one side of the question.</p><p id="71fa4288-f7a1-40fc-bcc9-4f4f9a927f96" class="">What is the core from which you name, what is the centre which is always naming, choosing, labelling. We all feel there is a centre, a core, do we not?, from which we are acting, from which we are judging, from which we are naming. What is that centre, that core? Some would like to think it is a spiritual essence, God, or what you will. So let us find out what is that core, that centre, which is naming, terming, judging. Surely that core is memory, isn’t it? A series of sensations, identified and enclosed – the past, given life through the present. That core, that centre, feeds on the present through naming, labelling, remembering.</p><p id="f980bba1-e5a4-4a8a-836f-f5e1f0020bff" class="">We will see presently, as we unfold it, that so long as this centre, this core, exists, there can be no understanding. It is only with the dissipation of this core that there is understanding, because, after all, that core is memory; memory of various experiences which have been given names, labels, identifications. With those named and labelled experiences, from that centre, there is acceptance and rejection, determination to be or not to be, according to the sensations, pleasures and pains of the memory of experience. So that centre is the word. If you do not name that centre, is there a centre? That is if you do not think in terms of words, if you do not use words, can you think? Thinking comes into being through verbalization; or verbalization begins to respond to thinking. The centre, the core is the memory of innumerable experiences of pleasure and pain, verbalized. Watch it in yourself, please, and you will see that words have become much more important, labels have become much more important, than the substance; and we live on words.</p><p id="a4efbf8c-4c5f-49a5-a9cf-c77e936f1129" class="">For us, words like truth, God, have become very important – or the feeling which those words represent. When we say the word ‘American’, ‘Christian’, ‘Hindu’ or the word ‘anger’ – we are the word representing the feeling. But we don’t know what that feeling is, because the word has become important. When you call yourself a Buddhist, a Christian, what does the word mean, what is the meaning behind that word, which you have never examined? Our centre, the core is the word, the label. If the label does not matter, if what matters is that which is behind the label, then you are able to inquire but if you are identified with the label and stuck with it, you cannot proceed. And we are identified with the label: the house, the form, the name, the furniture, the bank account, our opinions, our stimulants and so on and so on. We are all those things – those things being represented by a name. The things have become important, the names, the labels; and therefore the centre, the core, is the word.</p><p id="5f32985d-9721-4ca7-ba4e-2ebed95d8e8a" class="">If there is no word, no label, there is no centre, is there? There is a dissolution, there is an emptiness – not the emptiness of fear, which is quite a different thing. There is a sense of being as nothing; because you have removed all the labels or rather because you have understood why you give labels to feelings and ideas you are completely new, are you not? There is no centre from which you are acting. The centre, which is the word, has been dissolved. The label has been taken away and where are you as the centre? You are there but there has been a transformation. That transformation is a little bit frightening; therefore, you do not proceed with what is still involved in it; you are already beginning to judge it, to decide whether you like it or don’t like it. You don’t proceed with the understanding of what is coming but you are already judging, which means that you have a centre from which you are acting. Therefore you stay fixed the moment you judge; the words ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ become important. But what happens when you do not name? You look at an emotion, at a sensation, more directly and therefore have quite a different relationship to it, just as you have to a flower when you do not name it. You are forced to look at it anew. When you do not name a group of people, you are compelled to look at each individual face and not treat them all as the mass. Therefore you are much more alert, much more observing, more understanding; you have a deeper sense of pity, love; but if you treat them all as the mass, it is over.</p><p id="650281c2-2eef-447d-929c-6d2720cec8e7" class="">If you do not label, you have to regard every feeling as it arises. When you label, is the feeling different from the label? Or does the label awaken the feeling? Please think it over. When we label, most of us intensify the feeling. The feeling and the naming are instantaneous. If there were a gap between naming and feeling, then you could find out if the feeling is different from the naming and then you would be able to deal with the feeling without naming it.</p><p id="9e514b12-0968-4691-abdc-e4969ffffe29" class="">The problem is this: how to be free from a feeling which we name, such as anger. Not how to subjugate it, sublimate it, suppress it, which are all idiotic and immature, but how to be really free from it? To be really free from it, we have to discover whether the word is more important than the feeling. The word ‘anger’ has more significance than the feeling itself. Really to find that out there must be a gap between the feeling and the naming. That is one part.</p><p id="1788c405-9ce2-4a49-a6b5-b1b8119d3a78" class="">If I do not name a feeling, that is to say if thought is not functioning merely because of words or if I do not think in terms of words, images or symbols, which most of us do – then what happens? Surely the mind then is not merely the observer. When the mind is not thinking in terms of words, symbols, images, there is no thinker separate from the thought, which is the word. Then the mind is quiet, is it not? – not made quiet, it is quiet. When the mind is really quiet, then the feelings which arise can be dealt with immediately. It is only when we give names to feelings and thereby strengthen them that the feelings have continuity; they are stored up in the centre, from which we give further labels, either to strengthen or to communicate them.</p><p id="db5d8c50-0636-4dbb-a285-530f849091cf" class="">When the mind is no longer the centre, as the thinker made up of words, of past experiences – which are all memories, labels, stored up and put in categories, in pigeonholes – when it is not doing any of those things, then, obviously the mind is quiet. It is no longer bound, it has no longer a centre as the me – my house, my achievement, my work – which are still words, giving impetus to feeling and thereby strengthening memory. When none of these things is happening, the mind is very quiet. That state is not negation. On the contrary, to come to that point, you have to go through all this, which is an enormous undertaking; it is not merely learning a few sets of words and repeating them like a school-boy – ‘not to name’, ‘not to name’. To follow through all its implications, to experience it, to see how the mind works and thereby come to that point when you are no longer naming, which means that there is no longer a centre apart from thought – surely this whole process is real meditation.</p><p id="f8ea07fa-7234-4c9e-ad92-a76a298abc82" class="">When the mind is really tranquil, then it is possible for that which is immeasurable to come into being. Any other process, any other search for reality, is merely self-projected, homemade and therefore unreal. But this process is arduous and it means that the mind has to be constantly aware of everything that is inwardly happening to it. To come to this point, there can be no judgement or justification from the beginning to the end – not that this is an end. There is no end, because there is something extraordinary still going on. This is no promise. It is for you to experiment, to go into yourself deeper and deeper and deeper, so that all the many layers of the centre are dissolved and you can do it rapidly or lazily. It is extraordinarily interesting to watch the process of the mind, how it depends on words, how the words stimulate memory or resuscitate the dead experience and give life to it. In that process the mind is living either in the future or in the past. Therefore words have an enormous significance, neurologically as well as psychologically. And please do not learn all this from me or from a book. You cannot learn it from another or find it in a book. What you learn or find in a book will not be the real. But you can experience it, you can watch yourself in action, watch yourself thinking, see how you think, how rapidly you are naming the feeling as it arises – and watching the whole process frees the mind from its centre. Then the mind, being quiet, can receive that which is eternal.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="6c58e5f8-99bf-47c7-bae5-10dd48f0dd1b" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Energy</summary><p id="7e5cae71-8e5d-4a10-9d0d-e5c9168d5fae" class="">ONE OF OUR most difficult problems is what we call discipline, and it is really very complex. You see, society feels that it must control or discipline the citizen, shape his mind according to certain religious, social, moral and economic patterns.</p><p id="63181560-3a99-46ec-a722-935589888faa" class="">Now, is discipline necessary at all? Please listen carefully, don’t immediately say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Most of us feel, especially while we are young, that there should be no discipline, that we should be allowed to do whatever we like, and we think that is freedom. But merely to say that we should or should not have discipline, that we should be free, and so on, has very little meaning without understanding the whole problem of discipline.</p><p id="1f385141-8de6-4f09-9002-2a4884b28ade" class="">The keen athlete is disciplining himself all the time, is he not? His joy in playing games and the very necessity to keep fit makes him go to bed early, refrain from smoking, eat the right food and generally observe the rules of good health. His discipline is not an imposition or a conflict, but a natural outcome of his enjoyment of athletics.</p><p id="7cf5f91b-548a-41ac-aca0-281fba766eb4" class="">Now, does discipline increase or decrease human energy? Human beings throughout the world, in every religion, in every school of philosophy, impose discipline on the mind, which implies control, resistance, adjustment, suppression; and is all this necessary? If discipline brings about a greater output of human energy, then it is worthwhile, then it has meaning; but if it merely suppresses human energy, it is very harmful, destructive. All of us have energy, and the question is whether that energy through discipline can be made vital, rich and abundant, or whether discipline destroys whatever energy we have. I think this is the central issue.</p><p id="d9c6ad52-54bf-47ca-b9ad-05cf49d44cef" class="">Many human beings do not have a great deal of energy, and what little energy they have is soon smothered and destroyed by the controls, threats and taboos of their particular society with its so-called education; so they become imitative, lifeless citizens of that society. And does discipline give increased energy to the individual who has a little more to begin with? Does it make his life rich and full of vitality?</p><p id="aaabe868-7424-4536-8cd4-aefb809d3f9f" class="">When you are very young, as you all are, you are full of energy, are you not? You want to play, to rush about, to talk; you can’t sit still, you are full of life. Then what happens? As you grow up your teachers begin to curtail that energy by shaping it, directing it into various moulds; and when at last you become men and women the little energy you have left is soon smothered by society, which says that you must be proper citizens, you must behave in a certain way. Through so-called education and the compulsion of society this abounding energy you have when you are young is gradually destroyed.</p><p id="f4e26405-cf01-4663-a808-68c31686478d" class="">Now, can the energy you have at present be made more vital through discipline? If you have only a little energy, can discipline increase it? If it can, then discipline has meaning; but if discipline really destroys one’s energy, then discipline must obviously be put aside.</p><p id="dba4be26-5af5-404a-b32f-b22081b72db4" class="">What is this energy which we all have? This energy is thinking, feeling; it is interest, enthusiasm, greed, passion, lust, ambition, hate. Painting pictures, inventing machines, building bridges, making roads, cultivating the fields, playing games writing poems, singing, dancing, going to the temple, worshipping – these are all expressions of energy; and energy also creates illusion, mischief, misery. The very finest and the most destructive qualities are equally the expressions of human energy. But, you see, the process of controlling or disciplining this energy letting it out in one direction and restricting it in another becomes merely a social convenience; the mind is shaped according to the pattern of a particular culture, and thereby its energy is gradually dissipated.</p><p id="06b0d028-3702-42db-8ee9-1631999f1ed5" class="">So, our problem is, can this energy, which in one degree or another we all possess, be increased, given greater vitality – and if so, to do what? What is energy for? Is it the purpose of energy to make war? Is it to invent jet planes and innumerable other machines, to pursue some guru, to pass examinations, to have children, to worry endlessly over this problem and that? Or can energy be used in a different way so that all our activities have significance in relation to something which transcends them all? Surely, if the human mind, which is capable of such astonishing energy, is not seeking reality or God, then every expression of its energy becomes a means of destruction and misery. To seek reality requires immense energy; and, if man is not doing that, he dissipates his energy in ways which create mischief, and therefore society has to control him. Now, is it possible to liberate energy in seeking God or truth and, in the process of discovering what is true, to be a citizen who understands the fundamental issues of life and whom society cannot destroy? Are you following this, or is it a little bit too complex?</p><p id="4f035a62-f2ba-4cff-8010-e1795d5b0dc6" class="">You see, man is energy, and if man does not seek truth, this energy becomes destructive; therefore society controls and shapes the individual, which smothers this energy. That is what has happened to the majority of grown-up people all over the world. And perhaps you have noticed another interesting and very simple fact: that the moment you really want to do something, you have the energy to do it. What happens when you are keen to play a game? You immediately have energy, have you not? And that very energy becomes the means of controlling itself, so you don’t need outside discipline. In the search for reality, energy creates its own discipline. The man who is seeking reality spontaneously becomes the right kind of citizen, which is not according to the pattern of any particular society or government.</p><p id="a807c8df-e2a7-4fba-94a4-d95273b3e7b2" class="">So, students as well as teachers must work together to bring about the release of this tremendous energy to find reality, God or truth. In your very seeking of truth there will be discipline, and then you will be a real human being, a complete individual, and not merely a Hindu or a Parsi limited by his particular society and culture. If, instead of curtailing his energy as it is doing now, the school can help the student to awaken his energy in the pursuit of truth, then you will find that discipline has quite a different meaning.</p><p id="0dcd3288-8996-47a9-98bb-2a748a69a9d2" class="">Why is it that in the home, in the classroom and in the hostel you are always being told what you must do and what you must not do? Surely, it is because your parents and teachers, like the rest of society, have not perceived that man exists for only one purpose, which is to find reality or God. If even a small group of educators were to understand and give their whole attention to that search, they would create a new kind of education and a different society altogether.</p><p id="6e181e87-b483-41b7-96a3-b666fb9513ae" class="">Don’t you notice how little energy most of the people around you have, including your parents and teachers? They are slowly dying, even when their bodies are not yet old. Why? Because they have been beaten into submission by society. You see, without understanding its fundamental purpose which is to find extraordinary thing called the mind, which has the capacity to create atomic submarines and jet planes, which can write the most amazing poetry and prose, which can make the world so beautiful and also destroy the world – without understanding its fundamental purpose, which is to find truth or God, this energy becomes destructive; and then society says, ‘We must shape and control the energy of the individual.’</p><p id="ed7b4e05-83b2-43ed-9a16-6440aa083088" class="">So, it seems to me that the function of education is to bring about a release of energy in the pursuit of goodness, truth, or God, which in turn makes the individual a true human being and therefore the right kind of citizen. But mere discipline, without full comprehension of all this, has no meaning, it is a most destructive thing. Unless each one of you is so educated that, when you leave school and go out into the world, you are full of vitality and intelligence, full of abounding energy to find out what is true, you will merely be absorbed by society; you will be smothered, destroyed, miserably unhappy for the rest of your life. As a river creates the banks which hold it, so the energy which seeks truth creates its own discipline without any form of imposition; and as the river finds the sea, so that energy finds its own freedom.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="629c2035-3cee-4aa3-a2bc-fa4c1582d681" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Entertainment and Freedom</summary><p id="4098566c-6960-425e-9245-6864d33aca7b" class="">Freedom is very necessary in our life. Freedom is obviously not to do whatever you like, though this has been considered freedom and has been the way of our life. We feel thwarted, inhibited when our desires are denied. From this arises our resentments, our feeling that we are sat upon and so a continuous revolt. We have followed this course of life and we can see, if we are at all thoughtful, what it has brought to the world: utter chaos. Some of the psychologists have encouraged us to pursue our impulses without any restraint, to do what we like immediately, rationalizing such activity as necessary for each one’s growth. This was actually the cry for many generations, though there was outward restraint, and now they call it freedom to allow the child to do what he wants, and so on up the ladder of his life, which is society. And perhaps now there will be an opposite swing: control, inhibit, discipline and the psychological restraint. This appears to be the story of mankind. Added to this is the computer and the robot: the technology that is developing in this direction, hoping to produce and probably will produce a computer with a human brain which may think faster and more accurately and thus give freedom from long hours of labour. The computer too is gradually taking over the education of our children.</p><p id="60e30cbc-02fc-4c20-bec5-87a12562b3b6" class="">Highly qualified teachers and professors in their various subjects can inform the student without the actual presence of the teacher. This too will give us a certain freedom. Except in the totalitarian States, greater freedom is going to come to man and so perhaps allow him to do what he likes. Thus greater conflict may arise, greater misery and wars for man. When technology and computers with robots dominate and become part of our daily life, then what is to happen to the human brain which has been active so far in outward and physical struggle? Will the brain then become atrophied, working only a couple of hours or more? When relationship is between machine and machine, what is to happen to the quality and vitality of the brain? Will it seek some form of entertainment, religious or otherwise, or will it allow itself to explore the vast recesses of one’s being? The industry of entertainment is gathering more and more strength and very little human energy and capacity is turned inwardly, so if we are not aware, the entertainment world is going to conquer us.</p><p id="6f03d6f6-65f8-47a4-b041-0644c9178715" class="">So we must ask what is freedom? It is often said that freedom is at the end of drastic discipline and civilized control civilized in the sense of literature, art, museums and good food. This is merely the outward coating of a confused, declining human being. Is freedom a choice of entertainment? Is freedom choice at all? We always consider freedom as being from something: from bondage, anxiety, loneliness, despair and so on. Such consideration only leads to further and perhaps more refined states of misery, sorrow and the ugliness of hatred. Freedom is not choosing a leader, political or religious, to follow which obviously denies freedom. Freedom is not the opposite of slavery. Freedom is the ending: not giving continuity to what has been. Freedom in itself has no opposite.</p><p id="4f16f926-3844-4ec6-b707-baf48cfdc523" class="">After having read this and studied it, what is my relationship not to the student and to my wife and children, but to the world? Really to understand the depth of freedom one needs a great deal of intelligence and perhaps love. But the activities of the world are not intelligent and neither is my group of children. I spend most of my day with them: have I this quality of freedom, with its intelligence and love? If I have this, my problem is very simple. That very quality will operate and what I thought to be a problem will cease to be one. But I really do not have this. I can pretend, put on a show of friendliness, but that is very shallow. My responsibility is immediate. I cannot say to myself that I will wait until I will achieve freedom and this affection, love. I literally have no time because my students are in front of me. I cannot become a hermit: that will not solve any problem, mine or the world’s. I need lightning from heaven to break up this incrustation, this conditioning, to have this freedom and love; but there is no thunderbolt, no heaven. I can allow myself to come to an impasse and get depressed over the matter but that is an escape from the problem to completely enclose myself and thus be incapable of facing the actuality. As when I actually see the truth that there is no outside agent to help me in this dilemma, that no outside influence, no grace, no prayer will help in this matter, then perhaps I will have an uncontaminated energy. That energy may then be freedom and love.</p><p id="153b5d43-08fc-4d9e-9e39-d70cb43a4b5a" class="">But have I the energy of intelligence to dismantle the things which human beings all over the world, of whom I am one, have built psychologically around themselves? Have I the persistence to go through all this? I am asking these questions of myself and I shall be asking my students in a more gentle and benevolent manner. I see the implications of all this quite clearly and I must tread very softly. The true answer lies in intelligence and love. If you have these qualities you will know what to do. One must realize the truth of this very deeply, otherwise we shall all be perpetuating in one form or another the confusion between man and man.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="fd086c32-9731-4d97-bda9-bf23d4c949f4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Experiencing, and Entertainment</summary><p id="de08bc6b-3b77-4671-bb77-bbece8aa4563" class="">We all want experiences of some kind – the mystical experience, the religious experience, the sexual experience, the experience of having a great deal of money, power, position, domination. As we grow older we may have finished with the demands of our physical appetites but then we demand wider, deeper and more significant experiences, and we try various means to obtain them – expanding our consciousness, for instance, which is quite an art, or taking various kinds of drugs. This is an old trick which has existed from time immemorial – chewing a piece of leaf or experimenting with the latest chemical to bring about a temporary alteration in the structure of the brain cells, a greater sensitivity and heightened perception which give a semblance of reality. This demand for more and more experiences shows the inward poverty of man. We think that through experiences we can escape from ourselves but these experiences are conditioned by what we are. If the mind is petty, jealous, anxious, it may take the very latest form of drug but it will still see only its own little creation, its own little projections from its own conditioned background.</p><p id="321db102-a8f9-47ee-ac91-259b04deb698" class="">Most of us demand completely satisfying, lasting experiences which cannot be destroyed by thought. So behind this demand for experience is the desire for satisfaction, and the demand for satisfaction dictates the experience, and therefore we have not only to understand this whole business of satisfaction but also the thing that is experienced. To have some great satisfaction is a great pleasure; the more lasting, deep and wide the experience the more pleasurable it is, so pleasure dictates the form of experience we demand, and pleasure is the measure by which we measure the experience. Anything measurable is within the limits of thought and is apt to create illusion. You can have marvellous experiences and yet be completely deluded. You will inevitably see visions according to your conditioning; you will see Christ or Buddha or whoever you happen to believe in, and the greater a believer you are the stronger will be your visions, the projections of your own demands and urges.</p><p id="f4a1be7d-a5b1-43a2-8ff2-25d180e6caa2" class="">So if in seeking something fundamental, such as what is truth, pleasure is the measure, you have already projected what that experience will be and therefore it is no longer valid.</p><p id="0c3c91ec-8b8c-46ca-8603-d83b6f6cd80f" class="">What do we mean by experience? Is there anything new or original in experience? Experience is a bundle of memories responding to a challenge and it can respond only according to its background, and the cleverer you are at interpreting the experience the more it responds. So you have to question not only the experience of another but your own experience. If you don’t recognize an experience it isn’t an experience at all. Every experience has already been experienced or you wouldn’t recognize it. You recognize an experience as being good, bad, beautiful, holy and so on according to your conditioning, and therefore the recognition of an experience must inevitably be old.</p><p id="51d49404-00d5-47ce-bd7e-8b3dd72752c8" class="">When we demand an experience of reality – as we all do, don’t we? – to experience it we must know it and the moment we recognise it we have already projected it and therefore it is not real because it is still within the field of thought and time. If thought can think about reality it cannot be reality. We cannot recognize a new experience. It is impossible. We recognize only something we have already known and therefore when we say we have had a new experience it is not new at all. To seek further experience through expansion of consciousness, as is being done through various psychedelic drugs, is still within the field of consciousness and therefore very limited.</p><p id="c67d3ab9-cf5b-4c15-870b-4b4b06bf2f97" class="">So we have discovered a fundamental truth, which is that a mind that is seeking, craving, for wider and deeper experience is a very shallow and dull mind because it lives always with its memories.</p><p id="46b474bf-7dff-4594-b9b4-48dfa6092068" class="">Now if we didn’t have any experience at all, what would happen to us? We depend on experiences, on challenges, to keep us awake. If there were no conflicts within ourselves, no changes, no disturbances, we would all be fast asleep. So challenges are necessary for most of us; we think that without them our minds will become stupid and heavy, and therefore we depend on a challenge, an experience, to give us more excitement, more intensity, to make our minds sharper. But in fact this dependence on challenges and experiences to keep us awake, only makes our minds duller – It doesn’t really keep us awake at all. So I ask myself, is it possible to keep awake totally, not peripherally at a few points of my being, but totally awake without any challenge or any experience? This implies a great sensitivity, both physical and psychological; it means I have to be free of all demands, for the moment I demand I will experience. And to be free of demand and satisfaction necessitates investigation into myself and an understanding of the whole nature of demand.</p><p id="b0249303-5827-42b4-b095-f46833c94602" class="">Demand is born out of duality: ‘I am unhappy and I must be happy’. In that very demand that I must be happy is unhappiness. When one makes an effort to be good, in that very goodness is its opposite, evil. Everything affirmed contains its own opposite, and effort to overcome strengthens that against which it strives. When you demand an experience of truth or reality, that very demand is born out of your discontent with what is, and therefore the demand creates the opposite. And in the opposite there is what has been. So one must be free of this incessant demand, otherwise there will be no end to the corridor of duality. This means knowing yourself so completely that the mind is no longer seeking.</p><p id="74e3f457-580f-444d-b4d7-b02e63dec8ab" class="">Such a mind does not demand experience; it cannot ask for a challenge or know a challenge; it does not say, ‘I am asleep’ or ‘I am awake’. It is completely what it is. Only the frustrated, narrow, shallow mind, the conditioned mind, is always seeking the more. Is it possible then to live in this world without the more – without this everlasting comparison? Surely it is? But one has to find out for oneself.</p><p id="b70a97d5-1ebf-4491-8d1f-f9a587266cd1" class="">Investigation into this whole question is meditation. That word had been used both in the East and the West in a most unfortunate way. There are different schools of meditation, different methods and systems. There are systems which say, ‘Watch the movement of your big toe, watch it, watch it, watch it; there are other systems which advocate sitting in a certain posture, breathing regularly or practising awareness. All this is utterly mechanical. The other method gives you a certain word and tells you that if you go on repeating it you will have some extraordinary transcendental experience. This is sheer nonsense. It is a form of self-hypnosis. By repeating Amen or Om or Coca-Cola indefinitely you will obviously have-a certain experience because by repetition the mind becomes quiet. It is a well known phenomenon which has been practised for thousands of years in India – Mantra Yoga it is called. By repetition you can induce the mind to be gentle and soft but it is still a petty, shoddy, little mind. You might as well put a piece of stick you have picked up in the garden on the mantelpiece and give it a flower every day. In a month you will be worshipping it and not to put a flower in front of it will become a sin.</p><p id="b16cf2fc-ce2c-46fd-955e-6c58a09fac11" class="">Meditation is not following any system; it is not constant repetition and imitation. Meditation is not concentration. It is one of the favourite gambits of some teachers of meditation to insist on their pupils learning concentration – that is, fixing the mind on one thought and driving out all other thoughts. This is a most stupid, ugly thing, which any schoolboy can do because he is forced to. It means that all the time you are having a battle between the insistence that you must concentrate on the one hand and your mind on the other which wanders away to all sorts of other things, whereas you should be attentive to every movement of the mind wherever it wanders. When your mind wanders off it means you are interested in something else.</p><p id="197011cc-b034-4b09-8f74-b725fb9ac258" class="">Meditation demands an astonishingly alert mind; meditation is the understanding of the totality of life in which every form of fragmentation has ceased. Meditation is not control of thought, for when thought is controlled it breeds conflict in the mind, but when you understand the structure and origin of thought, which we have already been into, then thought will not interfere. That very understanding of the structure of thinking is its own discipline which is meditation.</p><p id="f4f3f740-01be-4ebb-a832-6f5dfd957ce2" class="">Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence. Silence put together by thought is stagnation, is dead, but the silence that comes when thought has understood its own beginning, the nature of itself, understood how all thought is never free but always old – this silence is meditation in which the meditator is entirely absent, for the mind has emptied itself of the past.</p><p id="decaf0bd-4070-4326-ac45-69278135e14d" class="">If you have read this book for a whole hour attentively, that is meditation. If you have merely taken away a few words and gathered a few ideas to think about later, then it is no longer meditation. Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive to the system and that is not attention. Meditation is one of the greatest arts in life – perhaps the greatest, and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it. It has no technique and therefore no authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, watch the way you walk, how you eat, what you say, the gossip, the hate, the jealousy – if you are aware of all that in yourself, without any choice, that is part of meditation.</p><p id="d7cff6ca-8ffc-4e60-bea7-e5f2969a17fd" class="">So meditation can take place when you are sitting in a bus or walking in the woods full of light and shadows, or listening to the singing of birds or looking at the face of your wife or child.</p><p id="c1a2e519-51fa-442c-aefc-c29076025125" class="">In the understanding of meditation there is love, and love is not the product of systems, of habits, of following a method. Love cannot be cultivated by thought. Love can perhaps come into being when there is complete silence, a silence in which the mediator is entirely absent; and the mind can be silent only when it understands its own movement as thought and feeling. To understand this movement of thought and feeling there can be no condemnation in observing it. To observe in such a way is the discipline, and that kind of discipline is fluid, free, not the discipline of conformity.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="3abe55c2-d2da-4052-9a22-ee11fae57c57" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Fact</summary><p id="60892e63-1e28-4564-9218-804795b708a7" class="">Now, what is a fact? What do you think is a fact? That which has happened before, an incident, a car accident, that is a fact. Or what is happening now, sitting here, is a fact. But what will happen in the future may not be a fact. So fact implies that which has happened before: yesterday, walking along the lane, I met a viper, I saw it, it didn’t bite me. That is a fact. And what is happening now, what I am thinking, what I am doing now, is a fact. And what I will do may not be a fact. It might happen or it might not happen. So if we are clear on what is a fact, then what is an idea? Is an idea a fact? And the word ‘idea’, the Greek and so on, Latin, means to observe. The root meaning of the word ‘idea’ is to observe, to perceive, to see. What we do is see a fact and make an abstraction of it and then pursue the idea. Which means there is always the fact and a conclusion from the fact, and pursue the fact, pursue the conclusion, not the understanding of the fact. Am I making myself clear?</p><p id="b4036cce-945b-45c8-97dd-81a496263765" class="">So please it is not how do you know what you are saying is true, the speaker is merely pointing out facts. Those facts are not personal. If I say I am a Hindu and I stick to it, that is a fact. Whether it is an illusion, whether it is some kind of superstitious sentimental nonsense, that also is fact. You understand? Fact can be an illusion, or actual. But most of us live with illusions. I am an Indian – that is an illusion. And you are, if I may most gently point out, you are British – that is also an illusion. This tribal insular worship is destroying the world. That is a fact. As long as I am an Arab and you are something else, I am going to destroy you because I believe by destroying you I will go to heaven. Right? That is an illusion that they have accepted as a fact, and for that illusion they are willing to fight and kill, and destroy. Right? So can we always deal with facts? I am asking: can we always be with facts? Not translate the facts according to my prejudice, according to my belief, according to my neurotic illusions, however noble they are, can I look at these facts and understand what those facts are telling, saying? Suppose I had an accident in a car, can I look at that fact that I was rather careless, driving too fast, not paying complete attention to what I was doing because I was talking to my friend next to me – that is a fact. But I then say, ‘No, it is your fault’ – you know, the other fellow is a fool!</p><p id="168be587-38f2-4ff3-809a-42550367cca0" class="">Now, it is a fact that we have ideals. Right? Don’t you all have ideals? No? I wish we could have a dialogue, friendly, talk to each other. Don’t you have ideals? I am afraid you do. Ideals. What are those ideals? Are they facts? The ideal that we must live peacefully. Right? The ideal that we must be – whatever it is, non-violent, or the ideals of a communist, which are drawn from historical study, but those studies are prejudiced by my conditioning, so why do we have ideals at all? I know this is a dangerous thing to say because most of us live with these extraordinary ideals. We are questioning, please I am not saying you should or should not have ideals. I am saying, why do we have ideals, faiths, beliefs, as a Christian, as a Buddhist, as a Hindu, I am an American, you are British, you know, all the rest of it – why? Is it our brain is incapable of living without any illusion? What do you say to that? Is my brain capable, strong, vital, to understand things as they are and not create a future ideal? Ideal is non-existent. And we know that ideals of every kind, faith, belief, divide people. That is a fact.</p><p id="4bb76f7c-6f95-47df-aa59-f0ccf9d7b156" class="">So, can we be free of ideals, of faith, of being identified with one group and against another group which identifies with another group. You follow? Be free of all this. Could we – or is that impossible? If we could have a dialogue about this then we would exchange views – yes, it is possible, it is not possible, why is it not possible – you understand? Could we do that now? To have a free mind, free brain, that is not cluttered up with a lot of rubbish, a lot of illusions, is that possible? And some of you may say, no, it is not possible because I can’t live without my beliefs. I must have my ideals, my faith, otherwise I am lost – with your faiths, with your beliefs, ideals you are already lost. That is a fact. You are very lost people. But whereas if we could have a dialogue, conversation, and say, why do I cling to my particular prejudice, particular ideal, and so on, why have I identified myself with them? Why do I identify myself with anything? You follow? Push it. Push it deeply to find out why we do all these things. Why we have allowed ourselves to be programmed. Why are we afraid of public opinion and so on and so on.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a8a1892a-9f36-41ed-9e93-fbb974dd5def" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Freedom, Fear, Security, Reality, Psychological Analysis</summary><p id="7d0c4a7a-9430-4650-9391-8c392fb41165" class="">Most of us want freedom, though we live in self-centred activity and our days are spent in concern about ourselves, our failures and fulfilments. We want to be free – not only politically, which is comparatively easy, except in the world of dictatorships – but also free from religious propaganda. Any religion, ancient or modern, is the work of propagandists and is therefore not religion at all. The more serious one is, the more one is concerned with the whole business of living, the more one seeks freedom and is questioning, without accepting or believing. One wants to be free in order to find out whether there is such a thing as reality, whether there is something eternal, timeless, or not. There is this extraordinary demand to be free in every relationship, but that freedom generally becomes a self-isolating process and therefore is not true freedom.<br/>In the very demand for freedom there is fear. Because freedom may involve complete, absolute insecurity and one is frightened of being completely insecure. Insecurity seems a very dangerous thing – every child demands security in its relationships. And as we grow older we keep on demanding security and certainty in all relationships – with things, with people and with ideas. That demand for security inevitably breeds fear and being afraid we depend more and more on the things to which we are attached. So there arises this question of freedom and fear and whether it is at all possible to be free of fear; not only physically, but psychologically, not only superficially but deep down in the dark corners of our mind, in the very secret recesses into which no penetration has been made. Can the mind be utterly, completely free from all fear? It is fear that destroys love – this is not a theory – it is fear that makes for anxiety, attachment, possessiveness, domination, jealousy in all relationships, it is fear that makes for violence. As one can observe in the overcrowded cities with their exploding populations, there is great insecurity, uncertainty, fear. And it is partly this that makes for violence. Can we be free of fear, so that when you leave this hall you walk out without any shadow of the darkness that fear brings?<br/></p><p id="c6adbfff-49ec-4409-bea5-c75e86ca6871" class="">To understand fear we must examine not only physical fears but the vast network of psychological fears. Perhaps we can go into this. The question is: how does fear arise – what keeps it sustained, gives it duration, and is it possible to end it? Physical fears are fairly easy to understand. There is instant response to physical danger and that response is the response of many centuries of conditioning, because without this there would not have been physical survival, life would have ended. Physically one must survive and the tradition of thousands of years says ‘be careful,’ memory says ‘be careful there is danger, act immediately.’ But is this physical response to danger fear?</p><p id="8e1a8fcb-6438-4f99-82be-8a5bfce193e4" class="">Please do follow all this carefully, because we are going to go into something quite simple, yet complex, and unless you give your whole attention to it we shall not understand it. We are asking whether that physical, sensory response to danger involving immediate action is fear? Or is it intelligence and therefore not fear at all? And is intelligence a matter of the cultivation of tradition and memory? If it is, why doesn’t it operate completely, as it should, in the psychological field, where one is so terribly frightened about so many things? Why doesn’t that same intelligence which we find when we observe danger, operate when there are psychological fears? Is this physical intelligence applicable to the psychological nature of man? That is, there are fears of various kinds which we all know – fear of death, of darkness, what the wife or the husband will say or do, or what the neighbour or the boss will think – the whole network of fears. We are not going to deal with the details of various forms of fear; we are concerned with fear itself, not a particular fear. And when there is fear and we become aware of it, there is a movement to escape from it; either suppressing it, running away from it, or taking flight through various forms of entertainment, including religious ones, or developing courage which is resistance to fear. Escape, entertainment and courage are all various forms of resistance to the actual fact of fear.</p><p id="6ba7108d-0e37-4f90-9461-06acad88f8be" class="">The greater the fear the greater the resistance to it and so various neurotic activities are set up. There is fear, and the mind – or the ‘me’ – says ‘there must be no fear,’ and so there is duality. There is the ‘me’ which is different from fear, which escapes from fear and resists it, which cultivates energy, theorizes or goes to the analyst; and there is the ‘not me’! The ‘not me’ is fear; the ‘me’ is separate from that fear. So there is immediate conflict between the fear, and the ‘me’ that is overcoming that fear. There is the watcher and the watched. The watched being fear, and the watcher being the ‘me’ that wants to get rid of that fear. So there is an opposition, a contradiction, a separation and hence there is conflict between fear and the ‘me’ that wants to be rid of that fear. Are we communicating with each other?</p><p id="c9ee4b49-79f1-490e-8260-a6f1a04ace21" class="">So the problem consigns of this conflict between the ‘not me’ of fear and the ‘me’ who thinks it is different from it and resists fear; or who tries to overcome it, escape from it, suppress it or control it. This division will invariably bring conflict, as it does between two nations with their armies and their navies and their separate sovereign governments.<br/>So there is the watcher and the thing watched – the watcher saying ‘I must get rid of this terrible thing, I must do away with it.’ The watcher is always fighting, is in a state of conflict. This has become our habit, our tradition, our conditioning. And it is one of the most difficult things to break any kind of habit, because we like to live in habits, such as smoking, drinking, or sexual or psychological habits; and so it is with nations, sovereign governments which say ‘my country and your country,’ ‘my God and your God,’ ‘my belief and your belief.’ It is our tradition to fight, to resist fear and therefore increase the conflict and so give more life to fear.<br/></p><p id="42b5dbd9-1d08-4834-a0f3-d64a51de4804" class="">If this is clear, then we can go on to the next step, which is: is there any actual difference between the watcher and the watched, in this particular case? The watcher thinks he is different from the watched, which is fear. Is there any difference between him and the thing he watches or are they both the same? Obviously they are both the same. The watcher is the watched – if something totally new comes along then there is no watcher at all. But because the watcher recognizes his reaction as fear, which he has known previously, there is this division. And as you go into it very, very deeply, you discover for yourself – as I hope you are doing now – that the watcher and the watched are essentially the same. Therefore if they are the same, you eliminate altogether the contradiction, the ‘me’ and the ‘not me,’ and with them you also wipe away all kind of effort totally. But this does not mean that you accept fear, or identify yourself with fear.</p><p id="f9354472-4a3f-4b6c-83e4-e6dc977f5aec" class="">There is fear, the thing watched, and the watcher who is part of that fear. So what is to be done? (Are you working as hard as the speaker is working? If you merely listen to the words, then I am afraid you will not solve this question of fear deeply.) There is only fear – not the watcher who watches fear, because the watcher is fear. There are several things that take place. First, what is fear and how does it come about? We are not talking about the results of fear, or the cause of fear, or how it darkens one’s life with its misery and ugliness. But we are asking what fear is and how it comes about. Must one analyze it continuously to discover the endless causes of fear? Because when you begin to analyze, the analyzer must be extraordinarily free from all prejudices and conditionings; he has to look, to observe. Otherwise if there is any kind of distortion in his judgment, that distortion increases as he continues to analyze.</p><p id="dc75db1e-8035-4319-bf7d-509701203f7b" class="">So analysis in order to end fear is not the ending of it. I hope there are some analysts here! Because in discovering the cause of fear and acting upon that discovery, the cause becomes the effect, and the effect becomes the cause. The effect, and acting upon that effect in order to find the cause, and discovering the cause and acting according to that cause, becomes the next stage. It becomes both effect and cause in an endless chain. If we put aside the understanding of the cause of fear and the analysis of fear, then what is there to do?</p><p id="6230b5f3-ff6e-4a12-829d-7744a187c9b9" class="">You know, this is not an entertainment but there is great joy in discovery, there is great fun in understanding all this. So what makes fear? Time and thought make fear – time as yesterday, today and tomorrow; there is the fear that tomorrow something will happen – the loss of a job, death, that my wife or my husband will run away, that the disease and pain that I have had many days ago will come back again. This is where time comes in. Time, involving what my neighbour may say about me tomorrow, or time which up to now has covered up something which I did many years ago. I am afraid of some deep secret desires which might not be fulfilled. So time is involved in fear, fear of death which comes at the end of life, which may be waiting around the corner and I am afraid. So time involves fear and thought. There is no time if there is no thought. Thinking about that which happened yesterday, being afraid that it may happen again tomorrow – this is what brings about time as well as fear.<br/>Do watch this, please look at it for yourself – don’t accept or reject anything; but listen, find out for yourself the truth of this, not just the words, not whether you agree or disagree, but go on. To find the truth you must have feeling, a passion for finding out, great energy. Then you will find that thought breeds fear; thinking about the past or the future – the future being the next minute or the next day or ten years hence – thinking about it makes it an event. And thinking about an event which was pleasurable yesterday, sustains or gives continuity to that pleasure, whether that pleasure be sexual, sensory, intellectual or psychological; thinking about it, building an image as most people do, gives to that event in the past a continuity through thought and breeds more pleasure.<br/></p><p id="a32f5758-89a4-4519-88dc-70413c46bfb6" class="">Thought breeds fear as well as pleasure; they are both matters of time. So thought engenders this two-sided coin of pleasure and pain – which is fear. Then what is there to do? We worship thought which has become so extraordinarily important that we think the more cunning it is, the better it is. In the business world, in the religious world, or in the world of the family, thought is used by the intellectual who indulges in the use of this coin, in the garland of words. How we honour the people who are intellectually, verbally clever in their thinking! But thinking is responsible for fear and the thing called pleasure.</p><p id="d2287d3d-7751-4f63-bfc8-42775803c111" class="">We are not saying we shouldn’t have pleasure. We are not being puritanical, we are trying to understand it, and in the very understanding of this whole process, fear comes to an end. Then you will see that pleasure is something entirely different, and we shall go into this if we have time. So thought is responsible for this agony – one side is agony, the other side is pleasure and its continuance: the demand for and the pursuit of pleasure, including the religious and every other form of pleasure. Then what is thought to do? Can it end? Is that the right question? And who is to end it? – is it the ‘me’ who is not thought? But the ‘me’ is the result of thought. And therefore you have again the same old problem; the me, and the ‘not me’ which is the watcher who says, ‘If only I could end thought then I’d live a different kind of life.’ But there is only thought and not the watcher who says, ‘I want to end thought,’ because the watcher is the product of thought. And how does thought come into being? One can see very easily, it is the response of memory, experience and knowledge which is the brain, the seat of memory. When anything is asked of it, it responds by a reaction which is memory and recognition. The brain is the result of millennia of evolution and conditioning – thought is always old, thought is never free, thought is the response of all conditioning.</p><p id="7a1d965f-8adb-414f-8efc-800c354d0b07" class="">What is to be done? When thought realizes that it cannot possibly do anything about fear because it creates fear, then there is silence; then there is complete negation of any movement which breeds fear. Therefore the mind, including the brain, observes this whole phenomenon of habit and the contradiction and struggle between the ‘me’ and the ‘not me.’ It realizes that the watcher is the watched. And seeing that fear cannot be merely analyzed and put aside, but that it will always be there, the mind also sees that analysis is not the way.</p><p id="10382786-ab07-431b-abcc-85d6157a78ea" class="">Then one asks: what is the origin of fear? How does it arise? We said that it came about through time and thought. Thought is the response of memory and so thought creates fear. And fear cannot end through the mere control or suppression of thought, or by trying to transmute thought, or indulging in all the tricks one plays on oneself. Realizing this whole pattern choicelessly, objectively, in oneself, seeing all this thought itself says, ‘I will be quiet without any control or suppression,’ ‘I will be still.</p><p id="66b7b85c-cf19-4c69-90f6-b48900ae58b1" class="">So then there is the ending of fear, which means the ending of sorrow and the understanding of oneself – self-knowing. Without knowing oneself there is no ending of sorrow and fear. It is only a mind that is free from fear that can face reality.<br/><br/>WHAT IS FEAR? If we can understand the question and problem of desire then we will understand and be free from fear. ‘I want to be something’ – that is the root of fear. When I want to be something, my wanting to be something and my not being that something creates fear, not only in a narrow sense but in the widest sense. So as long as there is the desire to be something there must be fear.<br/><br/></p><p id="4b126ed0-77c0-4753-90c6-f825840cd633" class="">Observing the Root of Fear - CAN THE MIND observe fear? Your fear: fear of death, fear of life, fear of loneliness, fear of darkness, fear of being nobody, fear of not becoming a great success, fear of not being a leader, a writer, fear of many different things. First of all, is one aware of it? Or one leads such a superficial life, everlastingly talking about something else, and so one is never aware of oneself, of one’s own fears. Then if one does become aware of those fears, at what level do you become aware? Is it an intellectual awareness of them or are you actually aware of your fears, and aware at the deeper levels of your mind of fear, of the deep hidden recesses? And if they are hidden, how are they to be exposed? Must you go to an analyst? And the analyst is yourself; he needs to be analysed too!</p><p id="b42f1e50-ab7d-4274-8bb2-6e1877e20683" class="">So how do you uncover the whole structure, the intricacies of fear? This is a tremendous problem, not just to be listened to for two or three minutes and then forgotten, to find out for oneself whether it is possible to expose all fears, or whether there is only one central fear that has many branches. When one sees the central fear the branches begin to wither away. Is there one central fear like the trunk of a tree, though it has many branches, and if you could understand that single root of fear you have understood the whole network of fear? How do you approach this, from the periphery or from the centre? If the mind can understand the root of fear then the branches, the various aspects of fear have no meaning, they wither away. So what is the root of fear? Can you look at your fear? Please look at it now, invite it. Naturally you are not afraid now, sitting here, but you know what your fears are: loneliness, not being loved, not being beautiful, frightened of losing your job, this or that. By looking at one fear, at your particular fear, you can then see the root of that fear; not only the root of that fear, but the root of all fear. Through one fear, by observing it in the sense of the observer being the observed, then you will see for yourself that through one fear you discover the very root of all fear.<br/>By looking at one fear you discover the very root of all fear.<br/></p><p id="49351f7d-efbd-4c8b-a111-772653f3ec47" class="">‘Suppose one is afraid of loneliness. Have you looked at loneliness or is that an idea of which you are frightened? Not the fact of loneliness but the idea of loneliness. Which is it, the idea or the actuality that frightens you? I have an idea of loneliness, the idea being the rationalization of thought which says, ‘I don’t know what it is but I am frightened of it.’ Or I know what loneliness is, which is not an idea but an actuality. I know it when I am in a crowd and suddenly feel that I am not related to anything, that I am absolutely disassociated, lost, cannot rely on anybody. All my moorings have been cut and I feel tremendously lonely, frightened. That is an actuality. But the idea about it is not an actuality, and most of us have an idea about fear.</p><p id="2c032a9b-e29a-4906-a2ad-c673b8d313e7" class="">So if it is not an idea but an actuality, what is loneliness? Aren’t we breeding it all the time by our self-centred activity, by this tremendous concern with ourselves, our looks, our attitudes, our opinions, our judgements, our position, our status, our importance? All that is a form of isolation. Throughout the day, for years we have done this, and suddenly we find we are utterly isolated. Our beliefs, God and everything goes away. There is this sense of tremendous isolation which cannot be penetrated and that naturally brings great fear. I observe that in my daily life, my activities, thoughts, desires, pleasures, experiences are more and more isolating. And the ultimate sense of it is death. I observe it. I observe it in my daily movements and activities. And in the observation of this loneliness, the observer is part of that loneliness, is essentially that loneliness. So the observer is the observed and therefore he cannot possibly escape from it, he cannot cover it up, try to fill it with good activity or whatever it is, going off to church or meditating and all the rest of it. So the observer is the observed and therefore what happens then? You have eliminated conflict altogether, haven’t you? You have tried to escape from it, to cover it up, to rationalize it. Now you are faced with it; you are that. When you are confronted with it completely and there is no escape and you are that, then there is no problem, is there? There is no problem because then there is no sense of loneliness at all. I wonder if you see this.</p><p id="ee5f8187-9fbc-486d-bccc-9869ec8ba262" class="">So can you observe your fear? Through one fear trace the very root of all fear? That is, through this sense of loneliness haven’t you traced the root of fear? I am lonely. I know what that means not as an idea but as an actuality. There is this extraordinary sense of loneliness, isolation. Isolation is a form of resistance, a form of exclusion and I am fully aware of it. I am also aware that the observer is the observed. And there is fear there, deep-rooted fear. Through one factor of fear, loneliness, I have been able to find out, look at the central fact of fear, which is the existence of the observer. If the observer is not – the observer being the past, his opinions, judgements, evaluations, rationalizations, interpretations, all the tradition – if that is not, where is fear? If the ‘me’ is not, where is the fear? But we are educated, religiously, to assert and cultivate the ‘me’ as the observer. So I am a Catholic, I am a Protestant, I am British, I am this, I am that. And by looking at one fear the mind has been able to look and trace the central fact of fear, which is the existence of the observer, the ‘me’.</p><p id="e1c32c5a-9c26-4303-b51b-e530ce989c24" class="">Can I live in this world without that ‘me’? When everything around me is the assertion of the ‘me’: the culture, the works of art, business, politics, religion, everything around me asserts, ‘be you’ – cultivate the ‘me’. In this culture or civilisation can one live without the ‘me’? The monks say you can’t, so escape from the world, go into a monastery, change your name, devote your life to this and that. But the ‘me’ is still there because that ‘me’ has identified itself with the image it has projected, as Christ, this, that and the other. The ‘me’ is still there, in a different form.</p><p id="98e03449-93cb-4350-ae24-2b3c9baa49c5" class="">So can one live – please, this is a tremendously important and a very, very serious question, it is not just something to play around with – can one live without that ‘me’ in this monstrous world? That means can one live sanely in a world of insanity? The world is insane, with all the make-believe of religions. You know everything that is happening, I don’t have to tell you. Can you live in an insane world and yourself be totally sane?</p><p id="34ae6c54-d6f8-4ceb-8126-d6d19738caf5" class="">WHAT IS FEAR? If we can understand the question and problem of desire then we will understand and be free from fear. ‘I want to be something’ – that is the root of fear. When I want to be something, my wanting to be something and my not being that something creates fear, not only in a narrow sense but in the widest sense. So as long as there is the desire to be something there must be fear.</p><p id="a300badf-9a36-409e-86e8-88a85d469b38" class="">WHAT IS FEAR? Fear cannot exist by itself. It is not an abstraction. An abstraction comes into being only when one runs away from fear into an idea or concept or activity. Suppose one is afraid. One’s mind is incapable of facing it and seeks an escape from it; then any thought or activity arising from that escape, from that flight from the fact of fear, breeds an abstraction, a life of contradiction. A life of contradiction brings more fear, more conflict, and all the complexities of existence. So you have to understand fear because fear breeds illusions and makes the mind dull. I do not know if you have not noticed when you are frightened, how your mind absolutely withdraws, isolates itself and looks immediately to somebody to help it out; how it builds a wall round itself through activity, through lies, through every form of activity except facing that fact.</p><p id="980db938-4373-4be8-b136-f8eb4e5a0576" class="">So, we are going to face the fact; not the speaker’s fear but your fear. How is one to understand that fear? The understanding of that fear is freedom from that fear. We are going to take a journey, we are going together to commune with that thing which we call fear, because one has to see the importance of understanding fear. It is a necessity to understand it. A mind that lives in fear is a dead mind, is a dull mind; it is a mind that cannot look, see, hear clearly, directly. So it is very important to understand one’s relationships with others, with society, with everything, and to be free of fear totally, not partially, not fragmentarily, not on various occasions, but completely. I say it is possible, and we will go into that. So, fear is not an abstraction, it is not a thing from which you can run away; it is there. Whether you run away for a day or a year, it catches you up wherever you are, and goes with you. You may turn your eyes away from it, but it is there.<br/>To understand consciousness, one has to be really free, totally, of fear.<br/></p><p id="d0eda517-bd2e-4c90-a44c-a9f735fa775e" class="">Fear exists only in relationship to something else. I am afraid of public opinion, I am afraid of my wife, I am afraid of my boss, I am afraid of losing my job, I am afraid of death, I am afraid of pain; I am not healthy, I would like to be healthy, and I am frightened of going back, of falling ill again; I am frightened because I am lonely; I am frightened because nobody loves me, nobody has a warm feeling for me; I am frightened of being nobody. There are various forms of fear, conscious and unconscious. If you are at all aware, not in the narrow sense but extensively, you can see the obvious fears: of losing a job and therefore playing up to the man above you; being frightened of not fulfilling; being frightened of not being somebody, being frightened of going wrong. So we have innumerable fears, and consciously we can know them quite easily. If you spend half an hour consciously, deliberately, to find out your fears, outwardly at least, you can easily stop them. But it is much more difficult to find out the unconscious fears, deep down within you, which have a greater importance and which during your sleep become dreams.</p><p id="745f550e-d55f-4e8b-9f12-806d930f7349" class="">So one has to understand fear. I am afraid of being lonely. Do you know what that word means? Have you ever felt what it is to be lonely? Probably not, because you are surrounded by your family, always thinking about your job, reading a book, listening to the radio or to the infinite gossip of the newspapers. So probably you never know that strange feeling of being completely isolated. You may have occasional intimations of it but probably you have never come into contact with it directly, as you have with pain, hunger or sex. But if you do not understand that loneliness which is the cause of fear, you will not understand fear and be free of it.</p><p id="9acb49e9-ea44-4092-9097-1a096405b585" class="">Fear expresses itself in many forms but there is only one fear. Fear is fear, not how it shows, not what are the mediums through which you are aware of the existence of fear. I may be afraid of public opinion, of death, of losing my job, of a thousand other things; but the fear is the same. Now, whether that fear is conscious or unconscious, one has to find out, one has to go into it. Unfortunately we have divided life as the conscious and the unconscious. The conscious mind is the educated mind, the modern technological mind that goes to the office every day, which is bored, which is fed up with all the routine of it, the lack of love of doing something for itself. So the conscious mind becomes the mechanical mind. It can think mechanically, it can go to the office and function. It does things mechanically: sex, affection, being mechanically conscious of everything, being kind when it pays, kicking when it does not pay; the whole thing, the strange phenomena of modern civilization. Then there is the unconscious which is very deep, which requires great penetration, understanding. Either one can understand the whole thing, both the conscious as well as the unconscious immediately, with one look, or you take time through analysing all the intimations and hints of the unconscious which arise through dreams and so on. Please follow this.</p><p id="c05e0939-582b-4052-a7e2-9948218ed0a5" class="">You can understand this whole structure of consciousness which is you as a human being, the whole consciousness of two million years of man, all that development, all that psychological structure of society can be understood immediately. Also the whole psychological structure of society with its greed, envy, ambition, despair, can be completely eliminated. Or you can analyse the whole process of consciousness step by step. But analysis will not free the mind. Then what will free the mind from ambition, greed, envy, anger, jealousy, and the demand for power? We also have all the animalistic instincts, consciously as well an unconsciously. And we can understand this whole psychological structure and be totally free of this animalistic, instinctual relationship of man with man, immediately. This is the only way to do it, not through analysis.<br/>It is only with direct contact with fear that you are free.<br/></p><p id="1626f60d-70ff-4161-82ee-19aaaee031a0" class="">But to understand this thing, to understand this consciousness, one has to be really free, totally, of fear. Fear is the essence of the animal. Now, to understand fear one must come directly into contact with it – that is, nonverbally. Take your fear: you are afraid of something, maybe of your wife, husband, or children. Take it, look at it, bring it out; not suppress it, not accept it, not deny it, but take hold of it, look at it. To look at it demands a mind fully aware, not a vague, dull mind. When you look at fear, come directly into contact with it, non-abstractly, nonverbally. Most of us do not come into contact with fear. The moment fear shows itself in any form, we run away from it. There is the fear of death. When you are afraid of death, your whole defensive psychological machinery is set going immediately; you invent beliefs, you run away from it, you have visions, you have dreams; but you avoid that thing. So the first thing to realize is that any form of escape not only perpetuates and strengthens fear but creates conflict, and therefore the mind is incapable of coming directly into contact with fear. Suppose the speaker is afraid; he has an idea, he has some hope; and that hope, that idea, that escape, becomes much more important than the fear itself because he is running away from the fact, and the running away – not the fear – creates conflict. When one is directly in contact with something, nonverbally, non-abstractly, without escape, there is no conflict. Only one who has ideas, hopes, opinions, all kinds of defences has conflict; and that conflict prevents one from coming directly into contact with fear. The moment you understand that every form of escape from fear only creates more conflict and therefore there is no direct contact with fear, and that it is only with direct contact with fear that you are free – when you understand that, not intellectually, not verbally, not as something you hear from somebody, but actually, for yourself see that, then you do not escape at all. Then the temple, the book, the leader, the guru, all disappear. Then you are not ambitious.<br/>We have to understand fear and be completely free of it, totally, right through your being. You can only do it when there is no escape of any kind. When you understand this, you are directly in contact with fear. In that contact there is no time interval, there is no saying, ‘I will get over it,’ or ‘I will develop courage,’ when you are frightened. We are dealing with facts, and we cannot deal with what is if there is any form of escape, conscious or unconscious.<br/></p><p id="9c5aa661-4cc9-4b73-9dd3-06b068e34d68" class="">There is physical fear. When you see a snake, a wild animal, instinctively there is fear; that is normal, healthy and natural. It is not fear, it is a normal desire to protect oneself. But the psychological protection of oneself, that is, the desire to be always certain, breeds fear. A mind that is seeking always to be certain is a dead mind, because there is no certainty in life, there is no permanency. And because you try to establish permanency in your relationship with your wife, with your family, you have jealousy. When you come directly into contact with fear, there is a response of the nerves. When the mind is no longer escaping through words or through activity of any kind, there is no division between the observer and the thing observed as fear. It is the mind that is escaping that separates itself from fear. But when there is a direct contact with fear there is no observer, there is no entity that says, ‘I am afraid.’ So, the moment you are directly in contact with life, with anything, there is no division and it is this division that breeds competition, ambition and fear.</p><p id="e5611efd-e004-4a3e-a09d-fb13e1b5b07c" class="">If you seek a way, a method, a system to be rid of fear, you will be everlastingly caught in fear. But if you understand fear, which can only take place when you come directly in contact with it then you do something. Only then will you find that all fear ceases – we mean all fear, not fear of this kind or of that kind. Because out of the freedom and the understanding and the learning about fear comes intelligence, and intelligence is the essence of freedom. And there is no intelligence if there is any form of conflict, and conflict must exist as long as there is fear.</p><p id="fba2b39b-cac6-4e34-aa7d-67a48c72717b" class="">I DO NOT KNOW whether you are conscious of your own conditioning, what it implies, and whether it is possible to be free. Conditioning is the very root of fear, and where there is fear there is no virtue. To go into this profoundly requires a great deal of intelligence, and we mean by intelligence the understanding of all influence and being free of it.</p><p id="7edf4de0-6583-458b-bff4-e8ee1f067632" class="">THERE IS IN OUR LIFE a constant state of comparison, competition and the everlasting struggle to be somebody – or to be nobody, which is the same thing. This is the root of all fear because it breeds envy, jealousy and hatred. Where there is hatred there is obviously no love, and more and more fear is generated.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="b72a7fb0-63ee-42ee-b586-41789ab86fa2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Fear, Clinging, Tradition, Imitation, Freedom, Education, Fearlessness</summary><p id="21766d13-9e15-4899-a1be-254ab0d0fa86" class="">In the journey of the soul, understanding and transcending fear is paramount. Fear, a shadow that dims the light within, often leads us to grasp tightly to the familiar—be it people, possessions, or the worn paths of tradition. This clinging, a manifestation of inner emptiness, obstructs the path to self-reliance and inner wealth. As we navigate through life, the challenge lies in acknowledging our fears without allowing them to define us or restrict our growth.</p><p id="23e03943-b990-4853-a571-a5b4961a924b" class="">Tradition, while a vessel of wisdom passed down through generations, can become a crutch for those fearing the uncharted territories of their own potential. It is essential to discern between honoring traditions that enrich the spirit and being ensnared by those that stifle creativity and initiative.

Such freedom is not the absence of influence but the presence of critical thought and the courage to forge one&#x27;s path.

This quest leads us to ponder the possibility of a mind stilled from recognition and experience, a state where true creation unfolds, beyond the confines of the self.</p><p id="9e535de1-cfc0-468f-ba6c-aae3eae88e67" class="">Can we discover a means to transcend the self without feeding its insatiable hunger for existence? The exploration of this question requires vigilance and a profound understanding of the self&#x27;s intricacies. In the stillness of the mind, free from the self&#x27;s clamor, lies the potential for true freedom and the cessation of all personal conflict.</p><p id="25761dcf-1787-47fe-bb56-7762a4138304" class="">The totality of the self, with its incessant striving for expression and achievement, often leaves us entangled in a web of identification and struggle. Yet, moments of clarity reveal the possibility of existing without the overwhelming presence of the &#x27;me&#x27;. This realization beckons us to a life unbound by identification, where the pursuit of knowledge and virtue takes on new meaning, not as tools for self-aggrandizement but as pathways to true understanding and liberation.</p><p id="93f6d294-52b1-4782-9f75-d47e9defbdc4" class="">Understanding oneself deeply, without preconceptions or motives, opens the door to a state of being where the self no longer dictates our existence. This journey of self-discovery is not about acquiring or achieving but about unveiling the essence of being, where the mind is free from the constructs of identification. In this space of understanding and love, the self dissipates, allowing us to experience the infinite.</p><p id="0349cbee-9a4e-474d-a812-8fc2b59aeddc" class="">This exploration is not confined to the solitary moments of realization but extends to a continuous, motiveless inquiry into the nature of our being. Such meditation on the self&#x27;s totality and the pressures that shape our existence prepares the ground for experiencing a reality beyond words, a reality found not through external means but within the depths of our own solitude and simplicity.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="d23a28ff-5bbb-4d9c-9431-882f104510b0" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Brain Function, Intellect, Freedom, Rationalization, Memory, Buddhism, Detachment, Relationship, Action</summary><p id="9f60d1dd-a81f-47bc-8723-97823d8b9b2b" class="">In the dance of existence, where perception and intellect intertwine, we find ourselves navigating the vast landscape of consciousness. Our minds, like sponges, absorb the myriad hues of life, constantly registering the ebb and flow of experiences. Within this intricate ballet, the intellect emerges, not as a separate entity, but as an extension of our cerebral tapestry, woven from the very fabric of thought and memory.</p><p id="05156c1d-96cc-42c0-8029-08f46b2f0ac3" class="">The quest for understanding beckons us to ponder: Can the intellect, birthed from the depths of our cognitive reservoir, truly grasp the essence of freedom? Or does it remain forever tethered, bound by the chains of its own creation? This journey of inquiry reveals that freedom, that elusive specter, cannot be ensnared by the intellect alone, for it is bound by the memories and knowledge that shape its existence.</p><p id="5f98974f-001a-41e3-9b68-2fb43ac2b8c9" class="">Yet, amidst this contemplation, a light flickers—awareness. An awareness that transcends the intellectual confines, questioning the very boundaries that encase it. Could it be that this awareness itself is the key to transcending the limitations imposed by our cognitive constructs?</p><p id="41445159-8628-4890-92ff-45f1177dafdb" class="">In the teachings of Buddhism, we find a mirror reflecting the impermanence of all things. This ancient wisdom teaches us that attachment to the transient dance of existence is but a path to suffering. The Buddha&#x27;s insight into the nature of life—its suffering, its impermanence—offers a profound understanding that liberation lies not in clinging, but in the release from attachment, in the recognition of the ephemeral nature of all that is.</p><p id="78fe031c-e1fa-4dcf-9ca6-68a7a270c302" class="">As we delve deeper into the essence of being, we encounter the concept of the Atman and the realization that true freedom lies beyond the intellectual domain. This realization beckons us to question the very nature of freedom itself. Is it an attainable state, or merely an illusion fashioned by the confines of our understanding?</p><p id="8ff999c8-b0d5-4ec8-8205-35c65f999294" class="">In this exploration, we are reminded that the intellect, while a formidable tool for navigating the realms of knowledge, cannot fathom the depths of freedom. It is in the state of not-knowing, of embracing the uncertainty of existence, that we find a glimpse of true liberation. This not-knowing is not a void but a space brimming with potential, where freedom from the known allows us to exist in the moment, unburdened by the past or the future.</p><p id="c83b5f13-850b-417a-850b-2f3e3861db26" class="">Our journey through life is fundamentally intertwined with the web of relationships that define our existence. From the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, we learn that neither attachment nor detachment holds the key to enlightenment, but rather, it is in the middle path where balance resides. Relationships, in their myriad forms, are the very fabric of life, and it is through our interactions with the world around us that we define our actions and, ultimately, our essence.</p><p id="eac8b73a-9676-44d2-87ce-10f1f7285d93" class="">Thus, to live fully is to engage with the world in a dance of relationship, where action and interaction weave the tapestry of existence. It is in this engagement, free from the constraints of the known, that we find the true essence of being—a state of freedom that transcends the intellectual, rooted in the heart of existence itself.</p></details></li></ul><p id="e352a178-0808-4fe1-b02f-0dc370ac056a" class="">In the journey of the soul, understanding and transcending fear is paramount. Fear, a shadow that dims the light within, often leads us to grasp tightly to the familiar—be it people, possessions, or the worn paths of tradition. This clinging, a manifestation of inner emptiness, obstructs the path to self-reliance and inner wealth. As we navigate through life, the challenge lies in acknowledging our fears without allowing them to define us or restrict our growth.</p><p id="b18ead54-7b09-42e4-a16f-7a84c7a8e399" class="">Tradition, while a vessel of wisdom passed down through generations, can become a crutch for those fearing the uncharted territories of their own potential. It is essential to discern between honoring traditions that enrich the spirit and being ensnared by those that stifle creativity and initiative. The practice of imitation, though sometimes necessary in learning, should not eclipse the quest for original expression and understanding. True creativity blossoms in the soil of introspection and freedom, not in the shadows of conformity and fear.</p><p id="1625c06b-41e5-4078-98aa-9cb3bd853e40" class="">A liberated mind, unchained from the fetters of fear and imitation, is the garden where the seeds of innovation and originality grow. Such freedom is not the absence of influence but the presence of critical thought and the courage to forge one&#x27;s path. Education, in its highest form, nurtures this freedom, encouraging a relationship with the world that is reflective, inquisitive, and unafraid.</p><p id="62e61cb9-7f45-4b01-b9c0-17d2a51c2a1a" class="">To cultivate a fearless spirit, one must engage with life&#x27;s myriad experiences with an open heart and a questioning mind. Fearlessness is not the repetition of courage in familiar circumstances but the dynamic engagement with the new, the challenging, and the unknown. It arises not from the comfort of habit but from the brave examination of the self and the world.</p><p id="6571bb3c-2a8a-4043-ac7d-9b26f3085431" class="">In this sacred exploration, let us remember that the essence of education is not merely the accumulation of knowledge but the awakening of the soul to its infinite potential. It calls us to live not in the shadow of compliance but in the light of understanding and love. As we journey through life, let us hold the torch of inquiry high, illuminating the path to a world where fear has no hold, and the spirit is free to soar.</p><ul id="c69eedd9-cd66-4990-921f-6bc9998bb9a3" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Intelligence</summary><p id="23cb2d40-5baa-4238-bc43-715850dd46c0" class="">The quest for understanding the essence of intelligence and its relationship with consciousness presents a profound exploration of the human mind&#x27;s capabilities and limitations.

This interconnectedness raises fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence and whether it operates within the same framework.</p><h3 id="6b5e0986-bb3f-40f3-8e43-86ee33b687fc" class="">The Quest for the Instrument of Transformation</h3><p id="898f96bc-5fcd-4748-affd-e118393cc2d7" class="">The inquiry into whether there exists an instrument or mechanism that allows thought to function only where it is needed, without encroaching upon areas where it creates confusion and suffering, is pivotal. This mechanism, referred to as intelligence, operates beyond the conventional domain of thought, enabling a harmonious balance between necessary cognitive functions and the freedom from the limitations imposed by thought.</p><h3 id="d38b0631-ac20-433f-b189-89331b1414b7" class="">Intelligence as the Key to Harmony</h3><p id="5389ee7e-0554-4972-bea3-c547343dd13a" class="">Intelligence, as discussed, is not merely an extension of thought or consciousness. Instead, it represents a quality of the mind that can discern the appropriate application of knowledge and thought, ensuring that they serve their purpose without leading to conflict or suffering. This intelligence is characterized by its ability to navigate the vast expanse of knowledge while retaining the capacity for insight and understanding beyond mere intellectual comprehension.</p><h3 id="63bd1f19-2d7f-4d0a-8e63-35a340026ed3" class="">Beyond the Known: The Space of Intelligence</h3><p id="35453cce-a553-4e79-a196-52ecf6d86d46" class="">A critical aspect of this exploration is the recognition that true intelligence operates in a space that is not confined by the known, the accumulated knowledge and experiences that constitute our consciousness. This space is not limited by the boundaries of thought but is a realm of pure potentiality where insight, creativity, and understanding can flourish without the constraints of the past or the anticipations of the future.</p><h3 id="624fbe83-c5f0-4ab3-ad8b-5cb954bf7a14" class="">The Role of Emptiness in Intelligence</h3><p id="b87fae67-e8fe-4d78-a015-a94aa1d3e29a" class="">The concept of emptiness emerges as a fundamental principle in understanding intelligence. This emptiness is not a void or absence but a state of being where the mind is free from the clutter of thoughts, beliefs, and preconceptions. It is from this state of emptiness that intelligence can truly operate, utilizing knowledge when necessary but remaining unattached and unencumbered by it.</p><h3 id="83a11214-f3b5-4fe1-b937-b61115c025cb" class="">The Non-Duality of Intelligence</h3><p id="9bdf33b7-e79a-4126-b5c9-2a573f560baf" class="">Intelligence transcends the duality of thought and non-thought, action and inaction. It represents a holistic understanding and engagement with life that is not based on opposition or conflict but on a seamless integration of all aspects of existence. This non-dualistic nature of intelligence allows for a way of being in the world that is rooted in awareness, compassion, and wisdom.</p><h3 id="69eb884e-4b67-4d98-a507-1d4bc94cc5e3" class="">The Universal Nature of Intelligence</h3><p id="781588da-f467-43ab-9e9d-35e257e25466" class="">Crucially, intelligence is understood as a universal quality, not confined to individual consciousness or personal experience.

This realization opens up new pathways for collective growth and transformation, moving beyond the limitations of individual ego and consciousness.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="2f6d6267-85a6-465e-8515-bdaa524f12b6" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Intuition</summary><p id="2d74c204-1541-4059-ae20-5d6941922c69" class="">You could say that intuition is a kind of knowing, but you don’t know how you got there. You know something, but you don’t know by what path you’ve arrived at what you know. It’s a sudden arising of knowledge or knowing something, but “I don’t know how I know this”. What is at work here is non-conceptual intelligence, when intuition arises.</p><p id="eb5d1242-e868-47a1-8502-2451af04904b" class="">Intuition is not arrived at by thinking, not by logic. It’s arrived at in a way that we cannot explain. It is closely related to creativity and inspiration. Inspiration also comes from that place. It is given to you. It is given to all great artists, musicians, writers, and even great scientists who made deep discoveries that were revolutionary – like Einstein. Einstein had a ‘sense’ of his theory of relativity. Before he could fully prove it, he already knew it was true. It was intuition that came to him. Of course, he had done a lot of thinking before that happened.</p><p id="f069c109-d3d4-47b9-88a6-fc8daf85a936" class="">Sometimes you have to do a lot of thinking, and then suddenly, thinking doesn’t get you anywhere anymore, and you stop thinking, and you go out and take a few deep breaths. Or you go out into nature and sit under a tree. And suddenly, intuition is there. Something you couldn’t have arrived at through thinking.</p><p id="e8f3c58b-1a3d-4764-80c8-1929b1c34125" class="">It’s vital for every human being to contact that place within, where intuition arises, because otherwise you are confined to the limitations of your conceptual mind.</p><p id="099e8350-3139-466a-9c7e-eab1d524f982" class="">Otherwise, your life is just repetitive, and no new ideas can come. If it’s a fresh and new idea, it comes from a place where all creativity arises – which ultimately, is the stillness within. That’s where intuition arises. If you can be still even for a moment, then there’s a possibility that some intuitive thing arises as a thought or as a spontaneous thing that you say, and you’ve surprised yourself. Maybe somebody needs your help or advice, and rather than thinking “I should be helping that person. What can I say next to help them?”, rather than that you just become still, listen, look. And suddenly you may find yourself saying something. It’s intuitive. Suddenly a deeper intelligence comes and uses your mind.</p><p id="f0550273-40fa-4f2d-ba6f-b4fb3a5019e6" class="">That’s what we call intuition. Realize that this is at the basis of all creative activities, all truly creative activities. Perception is something that comes from the outside, and intuition comes from the inner. It comes from you. It is essentially one with who you are, intelligence itself. The easiest way to develop intuition is to develop the ability to be still at times. Rather than “trying” to develop intuition, go to the place where all intuition arises. You don’t need to worry about becoming more intuitive if you focus more on being still. Not necessarily for long periods of time, but have moments of stillness in your life, so that every day is interspersed with moments of stillness.</p><p id="833f68e4-a6a2-4f0d-835e-d2fd75e91b9e" class="">You could just close your eyes and take one or two deep breaths. Or you don’t even have to close your eyes, but while you’re listening or looking at somebody, feel yourself breathing. Feel the inner aliveness within your body.</p><p id="58a0af7c-fa5e-41fc-8c4e-2178a30f91b8" class="">If you are looking at your computer screen, look away for a moment, or close your eyes for a moment, and take one or two conscious breaths. It brings you to stillness.</p><p id="cdae570d-35d7-4f44-ab07-5b796fe7b28d" class="">Wherever you are, there are always opportunities for a moment of stillness. And that is vital, because otherwise your life is unbalanced. If you don’t find stillness, all you have is activity – one thing after another. And this covers up your potential intuitive faculty, continuously. Seek out moments of stillness. Even the busiest person can do it. If you’re driving home, or driving to work, every traffic light is an invitation to stillness. There are so many opportunities for stillness. Stillness is where intuition arises.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="42250206-7362-4376-a909-bb1d8844fa90" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Gratitude</summary><p id="a07634a0-09ce-4d82-b5ef-f933650cb127" class="">We are talking about a deeper gratitude.

It’s not to do with what you are telling yourself in your head, it’s something that you sense in the present moment, it’s an appreciation of the “is-ness” of this moment.</p><p id="a6d836b3-dce0-47ff-b28c-c0061a77ae39" class="">We are using words as pointers. When I say “appreciation”, some people might ask “What do you mean by appreciation?” It’s to feel that the world around you is alive, and you share in the aliveness of the world that surrounds you. There’s the outer aliveness, in other human beings, even in your surroundings – whether it’s nature, or even in a room, you sense the aliveness of what’s around you at this moment, through your own aliveness. And with that comes the feeling, “it’s good to be alive”. You appreciate the many forms of life that are arising at this moment. You don’t impose judgment on the form that life takes at this moment, because the form that life takes changes continuously around you – one moment you’re here, the next moment you’re somewhere else.</p><p id="d8fc554b-cc8a-48dc-9fa3-0108b15cf443" class="">It’s a deep sense of Being-ness, or aliveness, and through that you appreciate what is, in your life. And by saying “in your life”, it always means in the present moment, because apart from the present moment, there is no such thing as “your life”. If there’s something else there that’s not the present moment that you call “your life”, it’s a mental construct.</p><p id="5777bef6-d12a-40a1-a4d0-b131f6df111e" class="">You have formed an image of “me” and “my life”, it’s a story, and you mistake that for your life. Fundamentally your life is whatever form this moment takes. Your life is always what is now. That’s your life. Not some story you’re telling yourself in your head.</p><p id="749e7c53-0e3a-44db-a5f6-1a8399485d8a" class="">Through that appreciation, you are sensing a sense of Oneness with what’s outside and what’s inside. There is no longer a separation that is created by excessive conceptual thinking between other people and the self, the separation is created by judgment. There is a sense of allowing the present moment to be as it is. All these are fundamental aspects of gratitude. It’s that openness to the ‘is-ness’ of this moment. With that openness, comes an appreciation for the “is-ness” of this moment. There is no longer a denial or a rejection of what is, because you have some story in your mind that clashes with what is around you at this moment. And that’s how many people live, so they go through life continuously, there’s a clash between their ideas of what should be now, and what is ‘now’.</p><p id="0ee32b8f-0cec-4979-9735-aa732a14fde9" class="">The greatest form of suffering and frustration and non-fulfillment is the clash between the mental story of what “should” be and what is. That’s really the root of the madness. There cannot be gratitude when that operates in your life.</p><p id="22d62d3d-7dec-468d-996e-5c01c3b257f1" class="">When something seemingly negative happens, people may find it very hard to say “Okay, I should be grateful, even for this”. I’m not saying you should do that, because even that is an idea in your head. It’s better to forget about trying to be grateful when something seemingly negative happens, and simply let go of the mental judgment of it, and say “This is what is, this is what happened, and this is the situation now”. If you can be free of mental judgment and denial or projection, complaining, and so on… just allow what is, and then something deeper emerges, even in a seemingly negative situation.</p><p id="ecbe93b4-1f86-4f30-88b4-ef4930d630ee" class="">By coming into this place of acceptance, of the inevitable ‘is-ness’ of now, your inner state is no longer ultimately dependent on what is happening or not happening outside. That is a vital transformation of consciousness, where the external world no longer determines your state of consciousness.</p><p id="bef53b9d-70cf-43f1-8db3-a2d3bac57b7a" class="">So when something seemingly bad happens, say “this is”. Whether it is a small thing or a large thing, be open to that. If you’re open to the ‘is-ness’ of what is, something within you which we could call “peace” arises. Sometimes it’s very subtle, and you can’t notice it at first.You’re not grateful for the seemingly bad thing, but you’re grateful that you can still be at peace, even in this situation. Internally you feel that by accepting, peace arises. Even in seemingly bad circumstances. And what is that peace? It’s an inner sense of aliveness, being-ness, presence. It’s the source of all gratitude.</p><p id="5390d291-a7ef-4887-bd7f-bc14980737ac" class="">There can be gratitude even when something bad happens. Not for the bad, but for the fact that even in the face of something seemingly negative, there is still peace in the background. But you won’t find that until you first accept what is.</p><p id="5211d696-1aa8-4324-a5e3-913a21c5cf86" class="">Gratitude is very important. It transforms your whole life, if you can remember the importance of being grateful for life. As you go through your day, every day, you can even have little reminders – of the importance of being appreciative of life.</p><p id="6f01f904-4618-49fd-9a4f-a43c2c111871" class="">Every person has to verify for themselves, what can I be grateful for at this moment?Sense the being that you are – not just the physical, but the sense of your own presence. That’s a great source of joy, to feel your own presence, it cannot really be defined. That’s the ultimate gratitude.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="d9780920-b07f-4424-bd9b-cd9d1fb01f72" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Manifestation, Illness and the Ego</summary><p id="648bb3cb-f937-41e0-ac95-7dd394eca7ed" class="">Understandably, millions of people on the planet today are experiencing fear and uncertainty around physical health—their own and that of friends and loved ones. It is an unprecedented time, and it is extremely important to remain as conscious as possible. The ego—on both the individual and the collective level—loves “the drama” that times like this can create. Our challenge is to remain alert and present so that we don’t fall into egoic reactivity, adding to the suffering so many are already facing.</p><p id="6604e083-acb0-4770-850c-ccc6782db222" class="">As we all know, nobody is totally immune from physical illness, and an illness can have many different causes. It is easy to fall into the error of misinterpreting the arising of illness as some kind of malfunction in your body, or as something that you have done or failed to do. In New Age parlance, people sometime ask themselves, “Why did I manifest this illness?” You then compound the situation by adding a narrative that may have nothing to do with the reality of the present moment. That can become very problematic.</p><p id="51f3ae4f-c1fc-42b8-b6c6-d57653365968" class="">The physical body is always susceptible to all kinds of influences. If something goes wrong with the body, then it becomes doubly important not to judge yourself or to say that you created it. If you are ill, whatever illness it may be, the most effective thing you can do is to surrender to what is, which does <em>not</em> mean surrender to what you call the illness. Surrender means acceptance. Acceptance initiates healing. The foundation for healing is to accept this moment as it is. In this moment, the so-called illness may manifest either as pain, discomfort, or some kind of disability. This is what you surrender to.</p><p id="ddc33023-446b-4063-9402-6ace8bd6fb71" class="">You never surrender to the <em>idea</em> of illness. You don’t say, “I must surrender to the fact that I have COVID-19,” or, even worse, “I must surrender to the fact that I have this incurable condition.” All you surrender to is the present moment, whatever the body manifests in the present moment. That is what is; that is what you accept. With that kind of surrender, a doorway opens into the transcendent dimension, and that’s where the power of manifestation really comes through.</p><p id="33c23787-c9c0-4c7f-88e3-fe41b08d8cfc" class="">So, if you are diagnosed with an illness, you don’t deny the illness, but you also don’t dwell on the concept of illness and build an identity around it. The ego will use anything for an enhanced sense of identity, and it will happily (or unhappily) use the idea of illness. It can then become incorporated into your sense of self, especially if it is a prolonged illness.</p><p id="3e71c3cd-2348-433c-a41b-df2bc90cf5a9" class="">The body is as it is right now. That’s fine.

Nevertheless, our view will still be biased and based on whichever team we support, as would be the view of each and every supporter. So, with an attendance of one thousand spectators, there will be a thousand unique views. Perhaps, if any view could be accepted as being most universally objective and genuine, it will come from someone who understands and enjoys the game but is inwardly neutral in terms of the game’s final outcome or score.</p><p id="1078c598-c9b4-48b7-917c-a020e703b33c" class="">It is the same with the question about the meaning of life.</p><p id="749756e1-dd99-467e-be18-fa153123fd48" class="">We can use this simple analogy or metaphor and see that it will be the same in the case of the lawyer, the mother, the doctor, the thief, the politician and the religious man. We each perceive what we consciously or unconsciously conceive. Each will perceive and experience life according to his conditioning and the role that he identifies with, but each person will only comprehend and reflect a limited perspective of the whole, shaped by the fearful and unavoidably self-opinionated mind.</p><p id="b1c534f0-00c5-4934-ba2e-97c01953d317" class="">Amongst the various types of beings, I feel that a sage is the one who has really grasped life in an all-encompassing and holistic way and this is so because, as an awakened being, his personal mind has merged in his universal consciousness—his source being. Such a one looks from the harmony and vastness of unconditioned consciousness, without personal interpretation or judgment. He feels at one with life in all its varied expressions and even beyond this. His enormous compassion and wisdom arises out of his effortless and natural understanding of the laws of nature, the universal play of existence as time and change and the unbroken recognition of his true Self as the core perceiver of the manifest and functioning world. His mind, free of conditioning, is not caught in the bubble of ego-identity and thus he becomes the true friend of all living beings. Seeing himself within all and all within himself, he lives the complete life. The sage alone opens the door to the Divine.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="5d9be38c-0fe5-4a6f-be5e-393aad10c9bc" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Resting and Healing</summary><p id="17b5e0c3-a21d-4908-b83a-01771ae1e3d9" class="">Resting the body for healing is of utmost importance.

He resided and imparted wisdom at the Kaiyuan Temple in ancient Muzhou. Muzhou&#x27;s family name was Chen, and he was widely recognized in China as &quot;Honored Elder Chen.&quot; According to the Wudeng Huiyuan, as a young man, he visited a temple to offer incense to Buddha. When he encountered the monks there, he felt a deep connection with them, as though they had known each other in a previous existence. Subsequently, he sought permission from his parents to become a monk, embarking on a unique spiritual journey. Muzhou possessed distinctive features, with penetrating eyes and seven pockmarks on his face. In his youth, he immersed himself in the study of the Vinaya and became well-versed in Buddhist scriptures. Later, during his travels, he crossed paths with Huangbo, ultimately becoming his Dharma successor. Muzhou played a significant role in the enlightenment of the renowned Zen master Linji, and he also taught the great Zen master Yunmen Wenyan.</p><p id="b5d89229-3582-40dd-bdf4-b3eb370ef874" class="">Muzhou was renowned for his stern teaching style, causing only the most self-assured students to approach him. Legend has it that he could discern a student&#x27;s disposition by the rhythm of their footsteps as they approached his quarters. Often, when a student drew near, Muzhou would abruptly shut the door and exclaim, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s here!&quot; If he observed a monk engaging in conversation within the meditation hall, he would summon the head monk and remark, &quot;That monk is a lumber carrier!&quot;</p><p id="b9e56373-a257-4f47-ac0c-e65df4b8fe2b" class="">Embrace the experience without reservation. Eliminating &quot;as if&quot; enhances the authenticity of your encounter. Initially, you might use &quot;as if&quot; because of uncertainty or the fear of appearing delusional, especially when you have never felt this oneness with existence before. However, &quot;as if&quot; weakens the impact of your experience. In these moments, there is no need to hedge your words.</p><p id="a9f9ec9e-8712-443c-b906-a2bedaf385a4" class="">Consider a notable philosophical work titled &quot;AS IF.&quot; Despite its profound statements, the author&#x27;s use of &quot;as if&quot; diminishes their significance. It is far better to assert the presence or absence of a belief rather than resorting to &quot;as if.&quot; Whether you state, &quot;I feel one with existence&quot; or &quot;I sense the absence of separation,&quot; it underscores the authenticity of your experience. Let go of the uncertainty and choose to convey your experience with conviction. Your assurance will strengthen these moments, making them more frequent and impactful. Eventually, you will possess unwavering certainty, even if the world questions your experiences. Your certainty will surpass the influence of external opinions. It becomes an innate knowing, transcending the need for validation.</p><p id="41d9aaf6-c265-471c-b161-4b08007a6fcc" class="">These moments of letting go are a testament to your progress in the right direction. They unfold naturally, and it is your responsibility to bask in their beauty. The more you revel in these moments, the more they will grace you with their presence.</p><p id="1683b028-8791-4ba7-8d5c-6a502f07483a" class="">The mind, however, is the primary obstacle on your spiritual journey. It tends to deceive, doubt, and create chaos, particularly when it senses its own vulnerability. Do not allow your mind to taint these experiences with skepticism or uncertainty. Instead, relish the state of letting go. When it happens effortlessly, without any struggle or control, it is pure and exquisite. You don&#x27;t need to strive for it; it occurs on its own.</p><p id="78bcb5bc-4118-42cf-88d3-7f3116d5e2c0" class="">Let me share a story to illustrate this point:</p><p id="c4e6ca12-b11f-4176-be23-cd13ee1c700a" class="">Bokoju, a Zen master, confounded his disciples with a daily ritual. Each morning upon awakening, he would utter, &quot;Bokoju, are you still here?&quot;</p><p id="e55d608e-6cbc-4b20-a428-88ccec1d53b4" class="">To this, he would respond, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p><p id="cfeb411d-c511-43d9-9f58-a4bf9ef77779" class="">The disciples found this habit perplexing. Finally, they gathered the courage to inquire, &quot;Master, you are Bokoju, and you inquire whether you are still here, then answer affirmatively. It appears bewildering.&quot;</p><p id="e5352fed-2be9-4e35-ade5-04e2b73af8b3" class="">Bokoju chuckled and explained, &quot;I enter a state of such profound relaxation and unity with existence that a question arises within me: Is Bokoju still contained within the confines of his familiar identity? To hear my own voice, I ask, &#x27;Bokoju, are you still here?&#x27; And when I ask this question, I respond affirmatively with &#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27;</p><p id="8369c5cb-ffcb-4520-a727-c51059a085e1" class="">&quot;Please do not mistake my actions for madness. Throughout the day, I am deeply engaged in addressing your concerns. However, during the night, I am left alone to dissolve into a state of letting go. When I awaken, I must remind myself of my identity: &#x27;Who am I? Why am I here? Who is this individual stirring awake?&#x27; Thus, I have adopted this strategy. While I forget all else, I remain mindful of a single entity: the name of Bokoju. When the day arrives that I forget even this name, prepare for my departure.&quot;</p><p id="9b2edb7a-4fa8-4dca-931f-190a569a8108" class="">His disciples were taken aback but assured him that they did not wish for him to forget. Bokoju replied, &quot;I will ask this question only once more.&quot;</p><p id="f69aff99-c463-4bad-a9b6-3cb722d88b80" class="">Remarkably, on the day of his passing, Bokoju did not utter the familiar question. He woke up, and his disciples wondered why he had broken his lifelong habit. In response to their curiosity, Bokoju elucidated, &quot;I am departing today, and Bokoju is no longer present. There is no one to answer &#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27;</p><p id="de8c69f6-93f2-4363-afb5-6aa9564f41f2" class="">&quot;I have been eagerly awaiting this morning to bid you all farewell and offer my blessings for the last time. Henceforth, this room will appear vacant to the casual observer, but to those who cherished me, it will forever overflow with my presence. Those who loved me profoundly may even perceive a voice emanating from nowhere each morning, asking, &#x27;Bokoju, are you still here?&#x27; — and responding, &#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27;&quot;</p><p id="e47f40bb-2e3b-41af-b74f-47e308e4327e" class="">This story underscores that even as you merge with existence, your individuality remains intact. Letting go entails shedding the ego, not your essence. When the ego dissolves, you become one with the universe. You can confidently declare your unity with existence, unburdened by qualifiers. Allow this harmonious state with existence to flourish. Do not let the mind sow seeds of doubt or uncertainty; simply enjoy the beauty of letting go. The more you revel in it, the more it will grace you with its presence.</p><p id="d04a52ff-6542-4445-97d5-d3d9c78b56f7" class="">The mind is the greatest impediment to your spiritual growth. It incessantly fabricates falsehoods. Even when genuine experiences transpire, it recoils in fear, sowing the seeds of doubt. Be cautious not to trust the mind&#x27;s deceptions. Embrace these moments with absolute certainty. The experience of letting go and dissolving into existence arises from a deeper source, beyond the mind&#x27;s reach. Cast aside &quot;as if&quot; and listen to this source, permitting these moments to take root without hindrance. These moments are destined to blossom within you.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="7cb525e0-e583-4c1b-bf44-a026fe99ef18" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Meaning of Surrender</summary><p id="3a2ed328-edc3-4d06-9555-220d5be50b60" class="">To some people, surrender may have negative connotations, implying defeat, giving up, failing to rise to the challenges of life, becoming lethargic, and so on. True surrender, however, is something entirely different. It does not mean to passively put up with whatever situation you find yourself in and to do nothing about it. Nor does it mean to cease making plans or initiating positive action.</p><p id="7f878041-29ca-47d9-bbf5-5212fad55208" class="">Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of <em>yielding to </em>rather than <em>opposing </em>the flow of life. The only place where you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Inner</p><p id="e2f0ef55-5ddc-47cb-85b5-9979322b6a47" class="">resistance is to say &quot;no&quot; to what <em>is, </em>through mental judgment and emotional negativity. It becomes particularly pronounced when things &quot;go <em>wrong,&quot; </em>which means that there is a gap between the demands or rigid expectations mind and what <em>is. </em>is the have lived Ion enough, you will know that things &quot;go wrong&quot; quite often. It is precisely at those times that surrender needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain and sorrow from your life. Acceptance of what <em>is </em>immediately frees you from mind identification and thus reconnects you with Being. Resistance <em>is </em>the mind.</p><p id="67e02115-a925-4e64-abbd-8ef52eee137f" class="">Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does riot mean that on the outer level you cannot take action and change the situation. In fact, it is not the overall situation that you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segment called the Now.</p><p id="9820d61f-9927-46f9-8ba7-0441c46c91a2" class="">For example, if you were stuck in the mud somewhere, you wouldn&#x27;t say: &quot;Okay, I resign myself to being stuck in the mud.&quot; Resignation is not surrender. You don&#x27;t need to accept an undesirable or unpleasant life situation. Nor do you need to deceive yourself and say that there is nothing wrong with being stuck in the mud. No. You recognize fully that you want to get out of it. You then narrow your attention down to the present moment without mentally labeling it in any way. This means that there is no judgment of the Now. Therefore, there is no resistance, no emotional negativity. You accept the &quot;isness&quot; of this moment. Then you take action and do all that you can to get out of the mud. Such action I call positive action. It is far more effective than negative action, which arises out of anger, despair, or frustration. Until you achieve the desired result, you continue to practice surrender by refraining from labeling the Now.</p><p id="1e54f6ea-6e7c-4f89-a91a-684c2e3445de" class="">Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am making. You are walking along a path at night, surrounded by a thick fog. But you have a powerful flashlight that cuts through the fog and creates a narrow, clear space in front of you. The fog is your life situation, which includes past and future; the flashlight is your conscious presence; the clear space is the Now.</p><p id="181fce29-2162-421e-acc7-14285e73842d" class="">Non-surrender hardens your psychological form, the shell of the ego, and so creates a strong sense of separateness. The world around you and people in particular come to be perceived as threatening. The unconscious compulsion to destroy others through judgment arises, as does the need to compete and dominate. Even nature becomes your enemy and your perceptions and interpretations are governed by fear. The mental disease that we call paranoia is only a slightly more acute form of this normal but dysfunctional state of consciousness.</p><p id="8508f757-356d-4b42-90b5-3998fab163da" class="">Not only your psychological form but also your physical form -- your body -- becomes hard and rigid through resistance. Tension arises in different parts of the body, and the body as a whole contracts. The free flow of life energy through the body, which is essential for its healthy functioning, is greatly restricted. Bodywork and certain forms of physical therapy can be helpful in restoring this flow, but unless you practice surrender in your everyday life, those things can only give temporary symptom relief since the cause -- the resistance pattern -- has not been dissolved.</p><p id="6585f9db-207a-4aa3-b997-9d453a2aaf20" class="">There is something within you that remains unaffected by the transient circumstances that make up your life situation, and only through surrender do you have access to it. It is your life, your very Being -- which exists eternally in the timeless realm of the present. Finding this life is &quot;the one thing that is needed&quot; that Jesus talked about.</p><p id="e9e944de-8d85-416a-b8f7-a41cb7d3ba76" class="">If you find your life situation unsatisfactory or even intolerable, it is only by surrendering first that you can break the unconscious resistance pattern that perpetuates that situation.</p><p id="fb35030c-0ec5-4312-9bd6-768d59418220" class="">Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action, initiating change or achieving goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different energy, a different quality, flows into your doing. Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of Being, and if your doing is infused with Being, it becomes a joyful celebration of life energy that takes you more deeply into the Now. Through nonresistance, the quality of your consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. The results will then look after themselves and reflect that quality. We could call this &quot;surrendered action.&quot; It is not work as we have known it for thousands of years. As more humans awaken, the word <em>work </em>is going to disappear from our vocabulary, and perhaps a new word will be created to replace it.</p><p id="e7f7dec3-9655-4f4e-a0a1-e9ce14e8f9ea" class="">It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is the main determinant of what kind of future you will experience, so to surrender is the most important thing you can do to bring about positive change. Any action you take is secondary. No truly positive action can arise out of an unsurrendered state of consciousness.</p><p id="82f98192-4733-4e5e-a613-610e8313ced8" class="">In the state of surrender, you see very clearly what needs to be done, and you take action, doing one thing at a time and focusing on one thing at a time. Learn from nature: See how everything gets accomplished and how the miracle of life unfolds without dissatisfaction or unhappiness. That&#x27;s why Jesus said: &quot;Look at the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin.&quot;</p><p id="43fa4990-76bf-48e0-9f34-fec4e0255d48" class="">If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, <em>separate out this instant </em>and surrender to what <em>is. </em>That&#x27;s the flashlight cutting through the fog. Your state of consciousness then ceases to be controlled by external conditions. You are no longer coming from reaction and resistance.</p><p id="8e7ecde5-6594-4dc6-998c-82bd3813f936" class="">Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, <em>&quot;Is </em>there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?&quot; If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the too things that you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn&#x27;t mean you should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don&#x27;t start to run &quot;mental <em>movies,&quot; </em>project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does -- do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.</p><p id="73603dce-1be5-43c3-aa4b-0ffbf018a832" class="">Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of &quot;I can&#x27;t be bothered anymore&quot; or <em>&quot;I just </em>don&#x27;t care anymore.&quot; If you look at it closely, you will find that such an attitude is tainted with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so is not surrender at all but masked resistance. As you surrender, direct your attention inward to check if there is any trace of resistance left inside you. Be very alert when you do so; otherwise, a pocket of resistance may continue to hide in some dark corner in the form of a thought or an unacknowledged emotion.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="9d5d9d72-d9ed-4f33-90c7-7ca27d8c44e7" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Surrendering from Suffering</summary><p id="94807973-3198-4816-86ba-ed9bfa7856f1" class="">Forget about surrender for a moment. When your pain is deep, all talk of surrender will probably seem futile and meaningless anyway. When your pain is deep, you will likely have a strong urge to escape from it rather than surrender to it. You don&#x27;t want to feel what you feel. What could be more normal? But there is no escape, no way out. There are many pseudo escapes -- work, drink, drugs, anger, projection, suppression, and so on -- but they don&#x27;t free you from the pain. Suffering does not diminish in intensity when you make it unconscious. When you deny emotional pain, everything you do or think as well as your relationships become contaminated with it. You broadcast it, so to speak, as the energy you emanate, and others will pick it up subliminally. If they are unconscious, they may even feel compelled to attack or hurt you in some way, or you may hurt them in an unconscious projection of your pain. You attract and manifest whatever corresponds to your inner state.</p><p id="f0b681a6-a5c9-4b7f-8243-3c7dd721864a" class="">When there is no way out, there is still always a way <em>through. </em>So don&#x27;t turn away from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. <em>Feel </em>it -- don&#x27;t <em>think </em>about it! Express it if necessary, but don&#x27;t create a script in your mind around it. Give all your attention to the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems to have caused it. Don&#x27;t let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. Since it is impossible to get away from the feeling, the only possibility of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothing will shift. So give your complete attention to what you feel, and refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, be intensely alert. At first, it may seem like a dark and terrifying place, and when the urge to turn away from it comes, observe it but don&#x27;t act on it. Keep putting your attention on the pain, keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whatever it is. Stay alert, stay present -- present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As you do so, you are bringing a light into this darkness. This is the flame of your consciousness.</p><p id="8ea0d70a-ad4c-4043-ba83-6fcb0b0a6984" class="">At this stage, you don&#x27;t need to be concerned with surrender anymore. It has happened already. How? Full attention <em>is </em>full acceptance, is surrender. By giving full attention, you use the power of the Now, which is the power of your presence. No hidden pocket of resistance can survive in it. Presence removes time. Without time, no suffering, no negativity, can survive.</p><p id="3780fa3c-1d81-4b07-8a5c-9f425a3da360" class="">The acceptance of suffering is a journey into death. Facing deep pain, allowing it to be, taking your attention into it, is to enter death consciously. When you have died this death, you realize that there is no death -- and there is nothing to fear. Only the ego dies.

It is described, among other places, in the Book of Revelation or <em>Apocalypse, </em>though cloaked in obscure and sometimes impenetrable symbology. This suffering is inflicted not by God but by humans on themselves and on each other as well as by certain defensive measures that the Earth, which is a living, intelligent organism, is going to take to protect herself from the onslaught of human madness.</p><p id="3ea3ab0b-1edf-40df-88be-30d16f0c6db5" class="">However, there is a growing number of humans alive today whose consciousness is sufficiently evolved not to need any more suffering before the realization of enlightenment.

Your mind is trying to make nothing into something. The moment you make it into something, you have missed it. Nothing -- space -- is the appearance of the Unmanifested as an externalized phenomenon in a sense-perceived world. That&#x27;s about as much as one can say about it, and even that is a kind of paradox. It cannot become an object of knowledge. You can&#x27;t do a Ph.D. on &quot;nothing.&quot; When scientists study space, they usually make it into something and thereby miss its essence entirely.

Chi is the inner energy field of your body. It is the bridge between the outer you and the Source. It lies halfway between the manifested, the world of form, and the Unmanifested. Chi can be likened to a river or an energy stream. If you take the focus of your consciousness deeply into the inner body, you are tracing the course of this river back to its Source. Chi is movement; the Unmanifested is stillness. When you reach a point of absolute stillness, which is nevertheless vibrant with life, you have gone beyond the inner body and beyond chi to the Source itself. the Unmanifested. Chi is the link between the Unmanifested and the physical universe. So if you take your attention deeply into the inner body, you may reach this point, this singularity, where the world dissolves into the Unmanifested and the Unmanifested takes on form as the energy stream of chi, which then becomes the world. This is the point of birth and death. When your consciousness is directed outward, mind and world arise. When it is directed inward, it realizes its own Source and returns home into the Unmanifested. Then, when your consciousness comes back to the manifested world, you reassume the form identity that you temporarily relinquished. You have a name, a past, a life situation, a future. But in one essential respect, you are not the same person you were before: You will have glimpsed a reality within yourself that is not &quot;of this world,&quot; although it isn&#x27;t separate from it, just as it isn&#x27;t separate from you. Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your life, don&#x27;t give 100 percent of your attention to the external world and to your mind. Keep some within. I have spoken about this already. Feel the inner body even when engaged in everyday activities, especially when engaged in relationships or when you are relating with nature. Feel the stillness deep inside it. Keep the portal open. It is quite possible to be conscious of the Unmanifested throughout your life. You feel it as a deep sense of peace somewhere in the background, a stillness that never leaves you, no matter what happens out here. You become a bridge between the Unmanifested and the manifested, between God and the world. This is the state of connectedness with the Source that we call enlightenment. Don&#x27;t get the impression that the Unmanifested is separate from the manifested. How could it be? It is the life within every form, the inner essence of all that exists. It pervades this world.

Others go from one relationship to another, from one pleasure-and-pain cycle to another, in search of the elusive goal of fulfillment through union with the opposite energy polarity. Still others compromise and continue to be together in a dysfunctional relationship in which negativity prevails, for the sake of the children or security, through force of habit, fear of being alone, or some other mutually &quot;beneficial&quot; arrangement, or even through the unconscious addiction to the excitement of emotional drama and pain.</p><p id="41a1431e-8dc8-44e4-a028-c3df81d0a3a9" class="">However, every crisis represents not only danger but also opportunity. If relationships energize and magnify egoic mind patterns and activate the pain- body, as they do at this time, why not accept this fact rather than try to escape from it? Why not cooperate with it instead of avoiding relationships or continuing to pursue the phantom of an ideal partner as an answer to your problems or a means of feeling fulfilled? The opportunity that is concealed within every crisis does not manifest until all the facts of any given situation are acknowledged and fully accepted. As long as you deny them, as long as you try to escape from them or wish that things were different, the window of opportunity does not open up, and you remain trapped inside that situation, which will remain the same or deteriorate further.</p><p id="9c8eaa86-891d-4b81-81b1-109132712f9e" class="">With the acknowledgment and acceptance of the facts also comes a degree of freedom from them. For example, when you <em>know </em>there is disharmony and you hold that &quot;knowing,&quot; through your knowing a new factor has come in, and the disharmony cannot remain unchanged. When you <em>know </em>you are not at peace, your knowing creates a still space that surrounds your nonpeace in a loving and tender embrace and then transmutes your nonpeace into peace. As far as inner transformation is concerned, there is nothing you can do about it. You cannot transform yourself, and you certainly cannot transform your partner or anybody else. All you <em>can </em>do is create a space for transformation to happen, for grace and love to enter.</p><p id="fcee1aa8-b2c6-4ed0-a46f-f581045b2813" class="">So whenever your relationship is not working, whenever it brings out the &quot;madness&quot; in you and in your partner, be glad. What was unconscious is being brought up to the light. It is an opportunity for salvation. Every moment, hold the knowing of that moment, particularly of your inner state. If there is anger, <em>know </em>that there is anger. If there is jealousy, defensiveness, the urge to argue, the need to be right, an inner child demanding love and attention, or emotional pain of any kind -- whatever it is, <em>know </em>the reality of that moment and hold the knowing. The relationship then becomes your <em>sadhana, </em>your spiritual practice. If you observe unconscious behavior in your partner, hold it in the loving embrace of your knowing so that you won&#x27;t react. Unconsciousness and knowing cannot coexist for long -- even if the knowing is only in the other person and not in the one who is acting out the unconsciousness. The energy form that lies behind hostility and attack finds the presence of love absolutely intolerable. If you react at all to your partner&#x27;s <em>unconsciousness, </em>you become unconscious yourself But if you then remember to <em>know </em>your reaction, nothing is lost.</p><p id="488c5932-22b5-4222-93ea-27ee3a60bf97" class="">Humanity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our only chance of survival as a race. This will affect every aspect of your life and close relationships in particular. Never before have relationship., been as problematic and conflict ridden as they are <em>now. </em>As you ma) have noticed, they are not here to make you happy or fulfilled. If you continue to pursue the goal of salvation through a relationship, you will be disillusioned again and again. But if you accept that the relationship is here to make you <em>conscious </em>instead of happy, then the relationship <em>will </em>offer you salvation, and you will be aligning yourself with the higher <em>consciousness </em>that wants to be born into this world For those who hold on to the old patterns, there will be increasing pain, violence, confusion, and madness.</p><p id="1702db8d-be15-4730-a014-4864f3f5d79a" class=""><em>I suppose that it takes two to make a relationship into a spiritual practice, as you suggest. For example, my partner is still acting out his of patterns of jealousy and control. I have pointed this out many times but he is unable to see it.</em></p><p id="3392e890-aa61-4206-a42b-18e82bbfe311" class="">How many people does it take to make your life into a spiritual practice? Never mind if your partner will not cooperate. Sanity -- consciousness -- can only come into this world through you. You do not need to wait for the world to become sane, or for somebody else to become conscious, before you can be enlightened. You may wait forever. Do not accuse each other of being unconscious. The moment you start to argue, you have identified with a mental position and are now defending not only that position but also your sense of self. The ego is in charge. You have become unconscious. At times, it may be appropriate to point out certain aspects of your partner&#x27;s behavior. If you are very alert, very present, you can do so without ego involvement -- without blaming, accusing, or making the other wrong.</p><p id="cfe57e47-82a0-42f3-941c-8ab05e10e148" class="">When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all judgment. Judgment is either to confuse someone&#x27;s unconscious behavior with who they are or to project your own unconsciousness onto another person and mistake <em>that </em>for who they are. To relinquish judgment does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction and unconsciousness when you see it. It means &quot;being the knowing&quot; rather than &quot;being the reaction&quot; and the judge. You will then either be totally free of reaction or you may react and still be the knowing, the space in which the reaction is watched and allowed to be. Instead of fighting the darkness, you bring in the light. Instead of reacting to delusion, you see the delusion yet at the same time look through it. Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all people to be as they are. No greater catalyst for transformation exists. If you practice this, your partner cannot stay with you <em>and </em>remain unconscious.</p><p id="d1e4f34f-6345-4602-839e-6a66dc46c12e" class="">If you both agree that the relationship will be your spiritual practice, so much the better. You can then express your thoughts and feelings to each other as soon as they occur, or as soon as a reaction comes up, so that you do not create a time gap in which an unexpressed or unacknowledged emotion or grievance can fester and grow. Learn to give expression to what you feel without blaming. Learn to listen to your partner in an open, nondefensive way. Give your partner space for expressing himself or herself. Be present. Accusing, defending, attacking -- all those patterns that are designed to strengthen or protect the ego or to get its needs met will then become redundant. Giving space to others -- and to yourself- is vital. Love cannot flourish without it. When you have removed the two factors that are destructive of relationships: When the pain-body has been transmuted and you are no longer identified with mind and mental positions, and if your partner has done the same, you will experience the bliss of the flowering of relationship. Instead of mirroring to each other your pain and your unconsciousness, instead of satisfying your mutual addictive ego needs, you will reflect back to each other the love that you feel deep within, the love that comes with the realization of your oneness with all that is. This is the love that has no opposite.</p><p id="fdc6f77d-b7c9-4e60-86e6-9774fc3f7003" class="">If your partner is still identified with the mind and the pain-body while you are already free, this will represent a major challenge -- not to you but to your partner. It is not easy to live with an enlightened person, or rather it is <em>so </em>easy that the ego finds it extremely threatening. Remember that the ego needs problems, conflict, and &quot;enemies&quot; to strengthen the sense of separateness on which its identity depends. The unenlightened partner&#x27;s mind will be deeply frustrated because its fixed positions are not resisted, which means they will become shaky and weak, and there is even the &quot;danger&quot; that they may collapse altogether, resulting in loss of self The pain-body is demanding feedback and not getting it. The need for argument, drama, and conflict is not being met. But beware: Some people who are unresponsive, withdrawn, insensitive, or cut off from their feelings may think and try to convince others that they are enlightened, or at least that there is &quot;nothing wrong&quot; with them and everything wrong with their partner. Men tend to do that more than women. They may see their female partners as irrational or emotional. But if you can feel your emotions, you are not far from the radiant inner body just underneath. If you are mainly in your head, the distance is much greater, and you need to bring consciousness into the emotional body before you can reach the inner body.</p><p id="ac04f2c2-8ae8-43bc-baa0-c2eb474e2699" class="">If there isn&#x27;t an emanation of love and joy, complete presence and openness toward all beings, then it is not enlightenment. Another indicator is how a person behaves in difficult or challenging situations or when things &quot;go wrong.&quot; If your &quot;enlightenment&quot; is egoic self-delusion, then life will soon give you a challenge that will bring out your unconsciousness in whatever form -- as fear, anger, defensiveness, judgment, depression, and so on. If you are in a relationship, many of your challenges will come through your partner. For example, a woman may be challenged by an unresponsive male partner who lives almost entirely in his head. She will be challenged by his inability to <em>hear </em>her, to give her attention and space to be, which is due to his lack of presence. The absence of love in the relationship, which is usually more keenly felt by a woman than a man, will trigger the woman&#x27;s pain-body, and through it she will attack her partner -- blame, criticize, make wrong, and so on. This in turn now becomes <em>his </em>challenge. To defend himself against her pain-body&#x27;s attack, which he sees as totally unwarranted, he will become even more deeply entrenched in his mental positions as he justifies, defends himself or counterattacks. Eventually, this may activate his own pain-body. When both partners have thus been taken over, a level of deep unconsciousness has been reached, of emotional violence, savage attack and counterattack. It will not subside until both pain- bodies have replenished themselves and then enter the dormant stage. Until the next time.</p><p id="800073da-b61a-4a27-90d0-81c318cbd1bc" class="">This is only one of an endless number of possible scenarios. Many volumes have been written, and many more could be written, about the ways in which unconsciousness is brought out in male- female relationships. But, as I said earlier, once you understand the root of the dysfunction, you do not need to explore its countless manifestations.</p><p id="79c83571-026a-46b5-a1a4-e0d279e0d7bc" class="">Let&#x27;s briefly look again at the scenario I have just described. Every challenge that it contains is actually a disguised opportunity for salvation. At every stage of the unfolding dysfunctional process, freedom from unconsciousness is possible. For example, the woman&#x27;s hostility could become a signal for the man to come out of his mind identified state, awaken into the Now, become present -- instead of becoming even more identified with his mind, even more unconscious. Instead of &quot;being&quot; the pain-body, the woman could be the knowing that watches the emotional pain in herself, thus accessing the power of the Now and initiating the transmutation of the pain. This would remove the compulsive and automatic outward projection of it. She could then express her feelings to her partner. There is no guarantee, of course, that he will listen, but it gives him a good chance to become present and certainly breaks the insane cycle of the involuntary acting out of old mind patterns. If the woman misses that opportunity, the man could watch his own mental-emotional reaction to her pain, his own defensiveness, rather than <em>being </em>the reaction. He could then watch his own pain-body being triggered and thus bring consciousness into his emotions. In this way, a clear and still space of pure awareness would come into being -- the knowing, the silent witness, the watcher. This awareness does not deny the pain and yet is beyond it. It allows the pain to be and yet transmutes it at the same time. It accepts everything and transforms everything. A door would have opened up for her through which she could easily join him in that space.</p><p id="755b35ba-9555-4bf5-9f45-76e337da3524" class="">If you are consistently or at least predominantly present in your relationship, this will be the greatest challenge for your partner. They will not be able to tolerate your presence for very long and stay unconscious. If they are ready, they will walk through the door that you opened for them and join you in that state. If they are not, you will separate like oil and water. The light is too painful for someone who wants to remain in darkness.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="102bbcc2-f281-4b17-9f07-22dd31cc29ce" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>How to remain present in conversations</summary><p id="90d54a90-25f0-4664-a35a-53dc80ff7c1b" class="">It’s not easy. The moment you start talking, the two minds come together and so they strengthen each other. A flow starts, a stream of thought. A moment ago you were present, and then somebody starts talking.</p><p id="a5390d4d-f260-4da6-988d-b10fdcd02cec" class="">What applies here is the loss of space during the conversation. Both participants of the conversation have lost any sense of space. There are only the words, the mind, the verbalization, the stream of thinking that becomes sounds. They are taken over by that. It has its own momentum – almost a little entity, a stream, that doesn’t want to end.</p><p id="c0c63286-c1b6-4860-ba05-002e4ec8712e" class="">Often, it generates emotions in the body. That strengthens it, amplifies it. If the mental stream triggers emotions, which it often does, especially when talking about other people, what they did, failed to do, did to you, did to others, criticisms, gossip, all kinds of emotional things, the ego comes in. When you can criticize another, the ego feels a little bit stronger. By diminishing another, in the delusional system of the ego, you have enhanced your own self-image a little bit. Any criticism of another is a part of that energy stream. And then emotions come, and they amplify the thoughts. It’s the loss of space.</p><p id="d1955257-e6df-4313-a721-af8c15f56a9b" class="">For you to regain space, without saying “I’m not talking anymore”, one thing is necessary for you – which is the realization that you’ve lost space. Without that, there’s nothing you can do – when you’re so taken over by a stream of thought, that you don’t even know you’ve been taken over by a stream of thought – there’s nothing you can do. “Forgive them, for they know not what they do”. They are unconscious. They are the stream of thought. And as the stream of thought, you don’t want it to end – because you don’t want your own end. Every entity wants to remain in form for as long as possible.</p><p id="6c872a32-ff54-4b4e-98e4-1ced9a1af905" class="">If there’s the slightest realization that you’ve lost space, at that moment you have a choice. What is your choice? Your choice is to bring some presence, some space, into the stream of thought. But how do you do that?</p><p id="1fa3e1df-7c5e-49e4-a4b7-b39bdb8028db" class="">It’s coming at you not only from within your own mind, but it’s coming at you from the other person too. The awareness is there, and it may only last three seconds, and then it’s gone again. So you have to use those two or three seconds, where you realize the loss of space, and do something in that space where you have some freedom to act. By a conscious choice, you take your attention out of thinking – but you have to anchor it somewhere else, otherwise it won’t work. So you choose your breath, or your body, or some other sense perception around you that you become aware of. When you are actually talking to another person, it’s probably easiest to either use your breath or your inner body.</p><p id="eea8482b-b86e-4699-af54-a01673cc6289" class="">Practice this beforehand, when conditions are easier, so that you can do it once it’s necessary. Go into your inner body, feel that your energy field is alive. And you’ll notice, you’re not thinking anymore. You can still listen. The amazing thing is that you can listen to another person, without thinking, easily, beautifully.</p><p id="1b76bc54-970b-4f73-86e1-d4477009e6fd" class="">You are listening, but part of your attention is on your energy field – so you’ve taken attention away from your thoughts. There is a sense of aliveness in the background.</p><p id="4536dd3e-e344-427d-8f8e-24024233c1e7" class="">It’s ultimately formless; it’s already the doorway into the formless. Feel that while you sit there and listen, and you’ve stepped out of the stream of thinking. Then, the quality of the interaction immediately changes. The other person may not consciously notice what’s happening, and may carry on for a while. It also does not mean that you cannot respond anymore. But how you respond and the quality of your response changes, too. You are no longer contributing to the negative nature, which is often the case, in conversations.</p><p id="7b4d390b-3f30-4e94-9aea-b3e08d5ee3a7" class="">A certain amount of stillness, then, will also be a part of the words that you speak. It’s so subtle that the other person probably will not notice it, consciously. So hang on to the inner body, let it be the anchor, and then you become present. If you lose it again, if the other person says something challenging, then after a little while you remember – and you go back into the inner body. That’s a powerful anchor, and then everything changes from there. It takes continuous practice.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="2fdf8e7c-b6f1-467a-84bd-8e06ff717bbc" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Personal Differences</summary><p id="68fbdd4c-7910-4767-bded-8658f9da318b" class="">Viewpoints, opinions, and mental positions are all thoughts – the thought says “this is how it is”, it is some kind of judgment or perspective on things. To be identified with a mental position is to derive your sense of self from that mental position. It’s a substitute identity, form identity, ego – a substitute for your true identity which is formless and has nothing to do with any thought – but is consciousness itself.</p><p id="8e9da318-06a7-4176-89ff-aac3528d0ea7" class="">This is a good opportunity for not giving up your thoughts – you are not required to watch Fox News, but if he is there watching Fox News, and the sound is there filling the house, you can either ask him to turn it down, or close the door, or surrender to what is, or walk out, or ask him to walk out. There are many choices, other than negativity. The main thing is mental positions – to withdraw your identification. You can still have your position, but there’s no ‘self’ in it anymore – it does not supply your sense of identity. Then you can allow somebody else to have their mental position. Perhaps you can then discover that beyond both your and your husband’s mental positions – there is something beyond, where you are not in conflict. Beyond his thoughts and your thoughts – maybe you can find that place.</p><p id="86e6d5db-1f4d-46da-acc6-30e3a35eb98f" class="">Your first responsibility is not to identify with a position. Everybody has to practice that one way or another. It’s a beautiful practice. It’s expressed in Zen. I don’t remember who said it, some Zen master said, “Don’t seek for the truth – just cease cherishing opinions”. And that’s enough. Many spiritually inclined people look for the ‘truth’ – hopefully at some point within, but first it starts outside. But don’t look for the truth, not even within, just stop cherishing opinions. Cherishing, not having. It doesn’t say stop having opinions, because that would be difficult – maybe a very advanced practice. Even I have some opinions, about Fox News, and so on – but cherishing means to identify with the opinion, to be in the thought. And then it gives you your sense of “I”. Then anybody who has a different or conflicting position becomes a kind of enemy. Then you’re trapped in form. This is a very common human condition. Most humans on the planet derive their identity from their thoughts. So the thought is invested with self. Maybe this is another way of speaking about the essential truth of the Buddha, who discovered that this sense of ‘self’ is an illusion. You derive your sense of self from form – because every thought is a thought-form. It’s an energy field.</p><p id="af4ba127-7f8a-484b-8402-5bc701b24145" class="">If this were your only spiritual practice, it would be enough. If you can try, for example, talking to the questioner, your husband can then become your spiritual teacher because he can continuously remind you not to be identified with mental positions. Then, you don’t resist the other person’s mental position, because you don’t need to – you allow it to be. You can even allow your own mental position to be. If you resist someone else’s mental position, you only strengthen it. Try arguing with him about Fox News or Sarah Palin, and you’ll see what I mean.</p><p id="3e81b4bd-7e2d-437d-b642-c762de6af27a" class="">You may find the miracle that it can happen quite easily, that somebody’s mental position either weakens or it may even dissolve when it’s not resisted – because it needs resistance to strengthen itself, and to gain energy through fighting another. It’s quite miraculous to see how it can happen when it’s not resisted, when it is allowed: “I know that’s what you think, and that’s okay”.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="14b049bb-40fc-45eb-b03d-de60ba1e15b0" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Love and Attachment</summary><p id="0f6fe2c0-8686-4dcf-97de-a15a1ee9e24c" class="">I REALIZE THAT love cannot exist when there is jealousy; love cannot exist when there is attachment. Now, is it possible for me to be free of jealousy and attachment? I realize that I do not love. That is a fact. I am not going to deceive myself; I am not going to pretend to my wife that I love her. I do not know what love is. But I do know that I am jealous and I do know that I am terribly attached to her and that in attachment there is fear, there is jealousy, anxiety; there is a sense of dependence. I do not like to depend but I depend because I am lonely; I am shoved around in the office, in the factory and I come home and I want to feel comfort and companionship, to escape from myself. Now I ask myself: how am I to be free of this attachment? I am taking that just as an example.</p><p id="1507c082-007c-4a28-b9a7-4ab07686b0ef" class="">At first, I want to run away from the question. I do not know how it is going to end up with my wife. When I am really detached from her my relationship to her may change. She might be attached to me and I might not be attached to her or to any other woman. But I am going to investigate. So I will not run away from what I imagine might be the consequence of being totally free of all attachment. I do not know what love is, but I see very clearly, definitely, without any doubt, that attachment to my wife means jealousy, possession, fear, anxiety and I want freedom from all that. So I begin to enquire; I look for a method and I get caught in a system. Some guru says: ‘I will help you to be detached, do this and this; practise this and this.’ I accept what he says because I see the importance of being free and he promises me that if I do what he says I will have reward. But I see that way that I am looking for reward. I see how silly I am; wanting to be free and getting attached to a reward.</p><p id="46d72026-8c12-4234-9d30-1c7d73a45b1d" class="">I do not want to be attached and yet I find myself getting attached to the idea that somebody, or some book, or some method, will reward me with freedom from attachment. So, the reward becomes an attachment. So I say: ‘Look what I have done; be careful, do not get caught in that trap.’ Whether it is a woman, a method, or an idea, it is still attachment. I am very watchful now for I have learned something; that is, not to exchange attachment for something else that is still attachment.</p><p id="7074fe0f-cc6e-4c97-b198-18cc42335726" class="">I ask myself: ‘What am I to do to be free of attachment?’ What is my motive in wanting to be free of attachment? Is it not that I want to achieve a state where there is no attachment, no fear and so on? And I suddenly realize that motive gives direction and that direction will dictate my freedom. Why have a motive? What is motive? A motive is a hope, or a desire, to achieve something. I see that I am attached to a motive. Not only my wife, not only my idea, the method, but my motive has become my attachment! So I am all the time functioning within the field of attachment – the wife, the method and the motive to achieve something in the future. To all this I am attached. I see that it is a tremendously complex thing; I did not realize that to be free of attachment implied all this. Now, I see this as clearly as I see on a map the main roads, the side roads and the villages; I see it very clearly. Then I say to myself: ‘Now, is it possible for me to be free of the great attachment I have for my wife and also of the reward which I think I am going to get and of my motive?’ To all this I am attached. Why? Is it that I am insufficient in myself? Is it that I am very very lonely and therefore seek to escape from that feeling of isolation by turning to a woman, an idea, a motive; as if I must hold onto something? I see that it is so, I am lonely and escaping through attachment to something from that feeling of extraordinary isolation.</p><p id="5d30a6d3-a619-4895-bae1-4ffe34c8af20" class="">So I am interested in understanding why I am lonely, for I see it is that which makes me attached. That loneliness has forced me to escape through attachment to this or to that and I see that as long as I am lonely the sequence will always be this. What does it mean to be lonely? How does it come about? Is it instinctual, inherited, or is it brought about by my daily activity? If it is an instinct, if it is inherited, it is part of my lot; I am not to blame. But as I do not accept this, I question it and remain with the question. I am watching and I am not trying to find an intellectual answer. I am not trying to tell the loneliness what it should do, or what it is; I am watching for it to tell me. There is a watchfulness for the loneliness to reveal itself. It will not reveal itself if I run away; if I am frightened; if I resist it. So I watch it. I watch it so that no thought interferes. Watching is much more important than thought coming in. And because my whole energy is concerned with the observation of that loneliness thought does not come in at all. The mind is being challenged and it must answer. Being challenged it is in a crisis. In a crisis you have great energy and that energy remains without being interfered with by thought. This is a challenge which must be answered.</p><p id="0abb3edf-ecde-4663-a9d4-34630b3797de" class="">I started out having a dialogue with myself. I asked myself what is this strange thing called love; everybody talks about it, writes about it – all the romantic poems, pictures, sex and all other areas of it? I ask: is there such a thing as love? I see it does not exist when there is jealousy, hatred, fear. So I am not concerned with love anymore; I am concerned with ‘what is’, my fear, my attachment. Why am I attached? I see that one of the reasons – I do not say it is the whole reason – is that I am desperately lonely, isolated. The older I grow the more isolated I become. So I watch it. This is a challenge to find out, and because it is a challenge all energy is there to respond. That is simple. If there is some catastrophe, an accident or whatever it is, it is a challenge and I have the energy to meet it. I do not have to ask: ‘How do I get this energy?’ When the house is on fire I have the energy to move; extraordinary energy. I do not sit back and say: ‘Well, I must get this energy’ and then wait; the whole house will be burned by then.</p><p id="aa5d3a6e-16c0-4bcb-9ac6-22f02b4d9d92" class="">So there is this tremendous energy to answer the question: why is there this loneliness? I have rejected ideas, suppositions and theories that it is inherited, that it is instinctual. All that means nothing to me. Loneliness is ‘what is’. Why is there this loneliness which every human being, if he is at all aware, goes through, superficially or most profoundly? Why does it come into being? Is it that the mind is doing something which is bringing it about? I have rejected theories as to instinct and inheritance and I am asking: is the mind, the brain itself, bringing about this loneliness, this total isolation? Is the movement of thought doing this? Is the thought in my daily life creating this sense of isolation? In the office I am isolating myself because I want to become the top executive, therefore thought is working all the time isolating itself. I see that thought is all the time operating to make itself superior, the mind is working itself towards this isolation.</p><p id="f7f230d0-166a-40d3-8903-87cad8d2daaf" class="">So the problem then is: why does thought do this? Is it the nature of thought to work for itself? Is it the nature of thought to create this isolation? Education brings about this isolation; it gives me a certain career, a certain specialization and so, isolation. Thought, being fragmentary, being limited and time binding, is creating this isolation. In that limitation, it has found security saying: ‘I have a special career in my life; I am a professor; I am perfectly safe.’ So my concern is then: why does thought do it? Is it in its very nature to do this? Whatever thought does must be limited.</p><p id="2f3f04a7-1fe1-4ee8-a90c-848e9f44d21d" class="">Now the problem is: can thought realize that whatever it does is limited, fragmented and therefore isolating and that whatever it does will be thus? This is a very important point: can thought itself realize its own limitations? Or am I telling it that it is limited? This, I see, is very important to understand; this is the real essence of the matter. If thought realizes itself that it is limited then there is no resistance, no conflict; it says, ‘I am that’. But if I am telling it that it is limited then I become separate from the limitation. Then I struggle to overcome the limitation, therefore there is conflict and violence, not love.</p><p id="a1875c5d-bac3-44f7-8abf-124aa080bc55" class="">So does thought realize of itself that it is limited? I have to find out. I am being challenged. Because I am challenged I have great energy. Put it differently: does consciousness realize its content is itself? Or is it that I have heard another say: ‘Consciousness is its content; its content makes up consciousness’? Therefore I say, ‘Yes, it is so’. Do you see the difference between the two? The latter, created by thought, is imposed by the ‘me’. If I impose something on thought then there is conflict. It is like a tyrannical government imposing on someone, but here that government is what I have created.</p><p id="7d31e1cc-7875-46b2-978e-e570c5d30aba" class="">So I am asking myself: has thought realized its own limitations? Or is it pretending to be something extraordinary, noble, divine? – which is nonsense because thought is based on memory. I see that there must be clarity about this point: that there is no outside influence imposing on thought saying it is limited. Then, because there is no imposition there is no conflict; it simply realizes it is limited; it realizes that whatever it does – its worship of god and so on – is limited, shoddy, petty – even though it has created marvellous cathedrals throughout Europe in which to worship.</p><p id="1d852215-798d-4674-bb6e-ed490087fb73" class="">So there has been in my conversation with myself the discovery that loneliness is created by thought. Thought has now realized of itself that it is limited and so cannot solve the problem of loneliness. As it cannot solve the problem of loneliness, does loneliness exist? Thought has created this sense of loneliness, this emptiness, because it is limited, fragmentary, divided and when it realizes this, loneliness is not, therefore there is freedom from attachment. I have done nothing; I have watched the attachment, what is implied in it, greed, fear, loneliness, all that and by tracing it, observing it, not analysing it, but just looking, looking and looking, there is the discovery that thought has done all this. Thought, because it is fragmentary, has created this attachment. When it realizes this, attachment ceases. There is no effort made at all. For the moment there is effort – conflict is back again.</p><p id="0ce8fece-9fde-4b5e-b3db-e3546e936745" class="">In love there is no attachment; if there is attachment there is no love. There has been the removal of the major factor through negation of what it is not, through the negation of attachment. I know what it means in my daily life: no remembrance of anything my wife, my girlfriend, or my neighbour did to hurt me; no attachment to any image thought has created about her; how she has bullied me, how she has given me comfort, how I have had pleasure sexually, all the different things of which the movement of thought has created images; attachment to those images has gone.</p><p id="a3034d00-669f-44c8-9831-f38d50e12ac1" class="">And there are other factors: must I go through all those step by step, one by one? Or is it all over? Must I go through, must I investigate – as I have investigated attachment – fear, pleasure and the desire for comfort? I see that I do not have to go through all the investigation of all these various factors; I see it at one glance, I have captured it.</p><p id="1cdb2b12-0394-4cc1-af70-ceec9885a036" class="">So, through negation of what is not love, love is. I do not have to ask what love is. I do not have to run after it. If I run after it, it is not love, it is a reward. So I have negated, I have ended, in that enquiry, slowly, carefully, without distortion, without illusion, everything that it is not – the other is.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="4d535258-e779-4781-ae9a-43e7ee95ac9e" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>What is love? Love and Desire</summary><p id="38bf467b-cea1-484b-af86-f5c8208d7996" class="">WHAT IS LOVE? This is a very complex question; all of us feel we love something or other, abstract love, love of a nation, love of a person, love of god, love of gardening, love of overeating. We have abused the word love so greatly that we have to find out basically what love is.</p><p id="b2643435-8dbd-48d2-a1a2-d35e6dc0cd48" class="">Love is not an idea. Love of God is an idea, love of a symbol is still an idea. When you go to the church and kneel down and pray, you are really worshipping, or praying to, something which thought has created. So, see what is happening, thought has created it – actually this is a fact – and you worship that which thought has created; which means you are worshipping, in a very subtle way, yourself. This may seem a sacrilegious statement, but it is a fact. That is what is happening throughout the world. Thought creates the symbol with all the attributes of that symbol, romantic or logical and sane; having created it you love it, you become totally intolerant of any other thing. All the gurus, all the priests, all the religious structures, are based on that. See the tragedy of it. Thought creates the flag, the symbol of a particular country, then you fight for it, you kill each other for it; your nation will destroy the earth in competition with another nation, and so the flag becomes a symbol of your love. We have lived for millions of years that way and we are still extraordinarily destructive, violent, brutal, cynical human beings.</p><p id="3043b2dc-7106-4f91-a2f4-c2e7bbe8c1b5" class="">When we say we love another, in that love there is desire, the pleasurable projections of the various activities of thought. One has to find out whether love is desire, whether love is pleasure, whether in love there is fear; for where there is fear there must be hatred, jealousy, anxiety, possessiveness, domination. There is beauty in relationship and the whole cosmos is a movement in relationship. Cosmos is order and when one has order in oneself one has order in one’s relationships and therefore the possibility of order in our society. If one enquires into the nature of relationship one finds it is absolutely necessary to have order, and out of that order comes love. What is beauty? You see the fresh snow on the mountains this morning, clean, a lovely sight. You see those solitary trees standing black against that white. Looking at the world about us you see the marvellous machinery, the extraordinary computer with its special beauty; you see the beauty of a face, the beauty of a painting, beauty of a poem – you seem to recognize beauty out there. In the museums or when you go to a concert and listen to Beethoven, or Mozart, there is great beauty – but always out there. In the hills, in the valleys with their running waters, and the flight of birds and the singing of a blackbird in the early morning, there is beauty. But is beauty only out there? Or is beauty something that only exists when the ‘me’ is not? When you look at those mountains on a sunny morning, sparkling clear against the blue sky, their very majesty drives away all the accumulated memories of yourself – for a moment. There the outward beauty, the outward magnificence, the majesty and the strength of the mountains, wipes away all your problems – if only for a second. You have forgotten yourself. When there is total absence of yourself beauty is. But we are not free of ourselves; we are selfish people, concerned with ourselves, with our importance or with our problems, with our agonies, sorrows and loneliness. Out of desperate loneliness we want identification with something or other and we cling to an idea, to a belief, to a person, especially to a person. In dependency all our problems arise. Where there is psychological dependency, fear begins. When you are tied to something corruption begins.</p><p id="ad83f070-1104-4070-afd4-de3d76306aa2" class="">Desire is the most urgent and vital drive in our life. We are talking about desire itself, not desire for a particular thing. All religions have said that if you want to serve god you must subjugate desire, destroy desire, control desire. All the religions have said: substitute for desire an image that thought has created – the image that the Christians have, that the Hindus have and so on. Substitute an image for the actual. The actual is desire – the burning of it and they think that one can overcome that desire by substituting something else for it. Or, surrender yourself to that which you think is the master, the saviour, the guru – which again is the activity of thought. This has been the pattern of all religious thinking. One has to understand the whole movement of desire; for obviously it is not love, nor yet compassion. Without love and compassion, meditation is utterly meaningless. Love and compassion have their own intelligence which is not the intelligence of cunning thought.</p><p id="5bdbe33a-26b6-4e2a-9995-eb7aaaae26a3" class="">So it is important to understand the nature of desire, why it has played such an extraordinarily important part in our life; how it distorts clarity, how it prevents the extraordinary quality of love. It is important that we understand and do not suppress, do not try to control it or direct it in a particular direction, which you think may give you peace.</p><p id="64baa150-7c70-48d8-a1d7-47e1b6a70b43" class="">Please bear in mind that the speaker is not trying to impress you or guide and help you. But together we are walking a very subtle, complex path. We have to listen to each other to find out the truth about desire. When one understands the significance, the meaning, the fullness, the truth of desire, then desire has quite a different value or drive in one’s life.</p><p id="4aefb10f-e9b3-466a-9ea1-114cf8f8c53e" class="">When one observes desire, is one observing it as an outsider looking at desire? Or is one observing desire as it arises? Not desire as something separate from oneself, one is desire. You see the difference? Either one observes desire, which one has when one sees something in the shop window which pleases one, and one has the desire to buy it so that the object is different from ‘me’, or else the desire is ‘me’, so there is a perception of desire without the observer watching desire.</p><p id="b02b3fa1-b1f7-402e-9b81-479b3833c063" class="">One can look at a tree. ‘Tree’ is the word by which one recognizes that which is standing in the field. But one knows that the word ‘tree’ is not the tree. Similarly one’s wife is not the word. But one has made the word one’s wife. I do not know if you see all the subtleties of this. One must very clearly understand, from the beginning, that the word is not the thing. The word ‘desire’ is not the feeling of it – the extraordinary feeling there is behind chat reaction. So one must be very watchful that one is not caught in the word. Also the brain must be active enough to see that the object may create desire – desire which is separate from the object. Is one aware that the word is not the thing and that desire is not separate from the observer who is watching desire? Is one aware that the object may create desire but the desire is independent of the object?</p><p id="7a434f40-a72a-4dc2-b559-c166c02047e3" class="">How does desire flower? Why is there such extraordinary energy behind it? If we do not understand deeply the nature of desire we will always be in conflict with each other. One may desire one thing and one’s wife may desire another and the children may desire something different. So we are always at loggerheads with each other. And this battle, this struggle, is called love, relationship.</p><p id="2848132b-60d2-469e-8429-dc1c126d8d06" class="">We are asking: what is the source of desire? We must be very truthful in this, very honest, for desire is very very deceptive, very subtle, unless we understand the root of it. For all of us sensory responses are important – sight, touch, taste, smell, hearing. And a particular sensory response may for some of us be more important than the other responses. If we are artistic we see things in a special way. If we are trained as an engineer then the sensory responses are different. so we never observe totally, with all the sensory responses. We each respond somewhat specially, divided. Is it possible to respond totally with all one’s senses? See the importance of that. If one responds totally with all one’s senses there is the elimination of the centralized observer. But when one responds to a particular thing in a special way then the division begins. Find out when you leave this tent, when you look at the flowing waters of the river, the light sparkling on the swiftness of the waters, find out if you can look at it with all your senses. Do not ask me how, for that becomes mechanical. But educate yourself in the understanding of total sensory response.</p><p id="ec7497d3-8235-4825-9d35-2fe07f5aef3e" class="">When you see something, the seeing brings about a response. You see a green shirt, or a green dress, the seeing awakens the response. Then contact takes place. Then from contact thought creates the image of you in that shirt or dress, then the desire arises. Or you see a car in the road, it has nice lines, it is highly polished and there is plenty of power behind it. Then you go around it, examine the engine. Then thought creates the image of you getting into the car and starting the engine, putting your foot down and driving it. So does desire begin and the source of desire is thought creating the image, up to that point there is no desire. There are the sensory responses, which are normal, but then thought creates the image and from that moment desire begins. Now, is it possible for thought not to arise and create the image? This is learning about desire, which in itself is discipline. Learning about desire is discipline, not the controlling of it. If you really learn about something it is finished. But if you say you must control desire, then you are in a totally different field altogether. When you see the whole of this movement you will find that thought with its image will not interfere; you will only see, have the sensation and what is wrong with that?</p><p id="3c825b39-cfc0-4836-8006-396dfc4b5103" class="">We are all so crazy about desire, we want to fulfil ourselves through desire. But we do not see what havoc it creates in the world – the desire for individual security, for individual attainment, success, power, prestige. We do not feel that we are totally responsible for everything we do. If one understands desire, the nature of it, then what place has it? Has it any place where there is love? Is love then something so extraordinarily outside of human existence that it has actually no value at all? Or, is it that we are not seeing the beauty and the depth, the greatness and sacredness of the actuality of it; is it that we have not the energy, the time to study, to educate ourselves, to understand what it is? Without love and compassion with its intelligence, meditation has very little meaning. Without that perfume that which is eternal can never be found. And that is why it is important to put the ‘house’ of our life, of our being, of our struggles, into complete order.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="fc37387f-549c-41db-ae79-b65b105d2835" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Does love exist?</summary><p id="3af0bf45-7cda-4db9-82bd-256528f2c76a" class="">I REALIZE THAT love cannot exist when there is jealousy; love cannot exist when there is attachment.

I am very watchful now for I have learned something; that is, not to exchange attachment for something else that is still attachment.</p><p id="67f42e00-3405-4ba8-aa53-6b2d05b0d907" class="">I ask myself: “What am I to do to be free of attachment?” What is my motive in wanting to be free of attachment? Is it not that I want to achieve a state where there is no attachment, no fear and so on? And I suddenly realize that motive gives direction and that direction will dictate my freedom. Why have a motive? What is motive? A motive is a hope, or a desire, to achieve something. I see that I am attached to a motive. Not only my wife, not only my idea, the method, but my motive has become my attachment! So I am all the time functioning within the field of attachment – the wife, the method and the motive to achieve something in the future. To all this I am attached. I see that it is a tremendously complex thing; I did not realize that to be free of attachment implied all this. Now, I see this as clearly as I see on a map the main roads, the side roads and the villages; I see it very clearly. Then I say to myself: “Now, is it possible for me to be free of the great attachment I have for my wife and also of the reward which I think I am going to get and of my motive?” To all this I am attached. Why? Is it that I am insufficient in myself? Is it that I am very very lonely and therefore seek to escape from that feeling of isolation by turning to a woman, an idea, a motive; as if I must hold onto something? I see that it is so, I am lonely and escaping through attachment to something from that feeling of extraordinary isolation.</p><p id="54c5b619-f1b5-4cc8-8382-14d2daedf482" class="">So I am interested in understanding why I am lonely, for I see it is that which makes me attached. That loneliness has forced me to escape through attachment to this or to that and I see that as long as I am lonely the sequence will always be this. What does it mean to be lonely? How does it come about? Is it instinctual, inherited, or is it brought about by my daily activity? If it is an instinct, if it is inherited, it is part of my lot; I am not to blame. But as I do not accept this, I question it and remain with the question. I am watching and I am not trying to find an intellectual answer. I am not trying to tell the loneliness what it should do, or what it is; I am watching for it to tell me. There is a watchfulness for the loneliness to reveal itself. It will not reveal itself if I run away; if I am frightened; if I resist it. So I watch it. I watch it so that no thought interferes. Watching is much more important than thought coming in. And because my whole energy is concerned with the observation of that loneliness thought does not come in at all. The mind is being challenged and it must answer. Being challenged it is in a crisis. In a crisis you have great energy and that energy remains without being interfered with by thought. This is a challenge which must be answered.</p><p id="9a70d6ab-6767-438d-9d9f-e7aaa7a0a2b5" class="">I started out having a dialogue with myself. I asked myself what is this strange thing called love; everybody talks about it, writes about it – all the romantic poems, pictures, sex and all other areas of it? I ask: is there such a thing as love? I see it does not exist when there is jealousy, hatred, fear. So I am not concerned with love anymore; I am concerned with ‘what is’, my fear, my attachment. Why am I attached? I see that one of the reasons – I do not say it is the whole reason – is that I am desperately lonely, isolated. The older I grow the more isolated I become. So I watch it. This is a challenge to find out, and because it is a challenge all energy is there to respond. That is simple. If there is some catastrophe, an accident or whatever it is, it is a challenge and I have the energy to meet it. I do not have to ask: “How do I get this energy?” When the house is on fire I have the energy to move; extraordinary energy. I do not sit back and say: “Well, I must get this energy” and then wait; the whole house will be burned by then.</p><p id="675bc0d1-378f-4e55-a941-01fa4a8316f1" class="">So there is this tremendous energy to answer the question: why is there this loneliness? I have rejected ideas, suppositions and theories that it is inherited, that it is instinctual. All that means nothing to me. Loneliness is ‘what is’. Why is there this loneliness which every human being, if he is at all aware, goes through, superficially or most profoundly? Why does it come into being? Is it that the mind is doing something which is bringing it about? I have rejected theories as to instinct and inheritance and I am asking: is the mind, the brain itself, bringing about this loneliness, this total isolation? Is the movement of thought doing this? Is the thought in my daily life creating this sense of isolation? In the office I am isolating myself because I want to become the top executive, therefore thought is working all the time isolating itself. I see that thought is all the time operating to make itself superior, the mind is working itself towards this isolation.</p><p id="60cb347c-67a2-4425-a394-a5cc2e8672e7" class="">So the problem then is: why does thought do this? Is it the nature of thought to work for itself? Is it the nature of thought to create this isolation? Education brings about this isolation; it gives me a certain career, a certain specialization and so, isolation. Thought, being fragmentary, being limited and time binding, is creating this isolation. In that limitation, it has found security saying: “I have a special career in my life; I am a professor; I am perfectly safe.” So my concern is then: why does thought do it? Is it in its very nature to do this? Whatever thought does must be limited.</p><p id="fcec5ca2-b341-4ffd-aafc-0fc2a63ae469" class="">Now the problem is: can thought realize that whatever it does is limited, fragmented and therefore isolating and that whatever it does will be thus? This is a very important point: can thought itself realize its own limitations? Or am I telling it that it is limited? This, I see, is very important to understand; this is the real essence of the matter. If thought realizes itself that it is limited then there is no resistance, no conflict; it says, “I am that”. But if I am telling it that it is limited then I become separate from the limitation. Then I struggle to overcome the limitation, therefore there is conflict and violence, not love.</p><p id="5e86bd44-58db-47f7-bc36-f260e7b16fec" class="">So does thought realize of itself that it is limited? I have to find out. I am being challenged. Because I am challenged I have great energy. Put it differently: does consciousness realize its content is itself? Or is it that I have heard another say: “Consciousness is its content; its content makes up consciousness”? Therefore I say, “Yes, it is so”. Do you see the difference between the two? The latter, created by thought, is imposed by the ‘me’. If I impose something on thought then there is conflict. It is like a tyrannical government imposing on someone, but here that government is what I have created.</p><p id="dffbf389-8286-472e-b167-d085e9f4490c" class="">So I am asking myself: has thought realized its own limitations? Or is it pretending to be something extraordinary, noble, divine? – which is nonsense because thought is based on memory. I see that there must be clarity about this point: that there is no outside influence imposing on thought saying it is limited. Then, because there is no imposition there is no conflict; it simply realizes it is limited; it realizes that whatever it does – its worship of god and so on – is limited, shoddy, petty – even though it has created marvellous cathedrals throughout Europe in which to worship.</p><p id="a91d314d-6f81-47f3-ad18-f74717984130" class="">So there has been in my conversation with myself the discovery that loneliness is created by thought. Thought has now realized of itself that it is limited and so cannot solve the problem of loneliness. As it cannot solve the problem of loneliness, does loneliness exist? Thought has created this sense of loneliness, this emptiness, because it is limited, fragmentary, divided and when it realizes this, loneliness is not, therefore there is freedom from attachment. I have done nothing; I have watched the attachment, what is implied in it, greed, fear, loneliness, all that and by tracing it, observing it, not analysing it, but just looking, looking and looking, there is the discovery that thought has done all this. Thought, because it is fragmentary, has created this attachment. When it realizes this, attachment ceases. There is no effort made at all. For the moment there is effort – conflict is back again.</p><p id="c4ef2cad-9847-4988-a3f1-7bad9dd0c51b" class="">In love there is no attachment; if there is attachment there is no love. There has been the removal of the major factor through negation of what it is not, through the negation of attachment. I know what it means in my daily life: no remembrance of anything my wife, my girlfriend or my neighbour did to hurt me; no attachment to any image thought has created about her; how she has bullied me, how she has given me comfort, how I have had pleasure sexually, all the different things of which the movement of thought has created images; attachment to those images has gone.</p><p id="030aff73-6d33-433d-be79-14da6dd0a767" class="">And there are other factors: must I go through all those step by step, one by one? Or is it all over? Must I go through, must I investigate – as I have investigated attachment – fear, pleasure and the desire for comfort? I see that I do not have to go through all the investigation of all these various factors; I see it at one glance, I have captured it.</p><p id="6e052cb4-3a1d-41dc-a3ea-633c4859665e" class="">So, through negation of what is not love, love is. I do not have to ask what love is. I do not have to run after it. If I run after it, it is not love, it is a reward. So I have negated, I have ended, in that enquiry, slowly, carefully, without distortion, without illusion, everything that it is not – the other is.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="ab8919c6-d383-425c-a297-df499bb4299e" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Addicted to other persons</summary><p id="15959e7a-ab00-457c-8abb-c360b96aa018" class="">The reason why the romantic love relationship is such an intense and universally sought-after experience is that it seems to offer liberation from a deep-seated state of fear, need, lack, and incompleteness that is part of the human condition in its unredeemed and unenlightened state. There is a physical as well as a psychological dimension to this state.</p><p id="3114dd98-fa71-45ba-bd49-7aac08192c69" class="">On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: You are either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-half of the whole. On this level, the longing for wholeness -- the return to oneness -- manifests as male- female attraction, man&#x27;s need for a woman, woman&#x27;s need for a man. It is an almost irresistible urge for union with the opposite energy polarity. The root of this physical urge is a spiritual one: the longing for an end to duality, a return to the state of wholeness. Sexual union is the closest you can get to this state on the physical level. This is why it is the most deeply satisfying experience the physical realm can offer. But sexual union is no more than a fleeting glimpse of wholeness, an instant of bliss. As long as it is unconsciously sought as a means of salvation, you are seeking the end of duality on the level of form, where it cannot be found. You are given a tantalizing glimpse of heaven, but you are not allowed to dwell there, and find yourself again in a separate body.</p><p id="661519e8-86ec-43c6-a915-6a40cc19378c" class="">On the psychological level, the sense of lack and incompleteness is, if anything, even greater than on the physical level. As long as you are identified with the mind, you have an externally derived sense of self. That is to say, you get your sense of who you are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who you are: your social role, possessions, external appearance, successes and failures, belief systems, and so on. This false, mind-made self, the ego, feels vulnerable, insecure, and is always seeking new things to identify with to give it a feeling that it exists. But nothing is ever enough to give it lasting fulfillment. Its fear remains; its sense of lack and neediness remains.</p><p id="afac26f7-b3e1-4aaa-9c65-e20c78612b4c" class="">But then that special relationship comes along. It seems to be the answer to all the ego&#x27;s problems and to meet all its needs. At least this is how it appears at first. All the other things that you derived your sense of self from before, now become relatively insignificant. You now have a single focal point that replaces them all, gives meaning to your life, and through which you define your identity: the person you are &quot;in love&quot; with. You are no longer a disconnected fragment in an uncaring universe, or so it seems. Your world now has a center: the loved one. The fact that the center is outside you and that, therefore, you still have an externally derived sense of self does not seem to matter at first. What matters is that the underlying feelings of incompleteness, of fear, lack and unfulfilment so characteristic of the egoic state are no longer there -- or are they? Have they dissolved, or do they continue to exist underneath the happy surface reality?</p><p id="170ec835-8350-4646-b6ea-a8c49663c325" class="">If in your relationships you experience both &quot;love&quot; and the opposite of love -- attack, emotional violence, and so on -- then it is likely that you are confusing ego attachment and addictive clinging with love. You cannot love your partner one moment and attack him or her the next. True love has no opposite. If your &quot;love&quot; has an opposite, then it is not love but a strong ego-need for a more complete and deeper sense of self, a need that the other person temporarily meets. It is the ego&#x27;s substitute for salvation, and for a short time it almost does feel like salvation.</p><p id="2bd6d414-bc34-42a7-81d2-9e17bbf0d51e" class="">But there comes a point when your partner behaves in ways that fail to meet your needs, or rather those of your ego. The feelings of fear, pain, and lack that are an intrinsic part of egoic consciousness but had been covered up by the &quot;love relationship&quot; now resurface. Just as with every other addiction, you are on a high when the drug is available, but invariably there comes a time when the drug no longer works for you. When those painful feelings reappear, you feel them even more strongly than before, and what is more, you now perceive your partner as the <em>cause </em>of those feelings. This means that you project them outward and attack the other with all the savage violence that is part of your pain. This attack may awaken the partner&#x27;s own pain, and he or she may counter your attack. At this point, the ego is still unconsciously hoping that its attack or its attempts at manipulation will be sufficient punishment to induce your partner to change their behavior, so that it can use them again as a cover-up for your pain.</p><p id="623cad78-f391-41de-82c1-a3bb60cfdbec" class="">Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through your own pain. Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. Whatever the substance you are addicted to -- alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a person -- you are using something or somebody to cover up your pain. That is why, after the initial euphoria has passed, there is so much unhappiness, so much pain in intimate relationships. They do not cause pain and unhappiness. They <em>bring out </em>the pain and unhappiness that is already in you. Every addiction does that. Every addiction reaches a point where it does not work for you anymore, and then you feel the pain more intensely than ever.</p><p id="38d768b1-9b92-4a19-8fe3-7f05fb2645b8" class="">This is one reason why most people are always trying to escape from the present moment and are seeking some kind of salvation in the future. The first thing that they might encounter if they focused their attention on the Now is their own pain, and this is what they fear. If they only knew how easy it is to access in the Now the power of presence that dissolves the past and its pain, the reality that dissolves the illusion. If they only knew how close they are to their own reality, how close to God.</p><p id="d0e86c18-e75d-40a0-8da3-b651b7fba013" class="">Avoidance of relationships in an attempt to avoid pain is not the answer either. The pain is there anyway. Three failed relationships in as many years are more likely to force you into awakening than three years on a desert island or shut away in your room. But if you could bring intense presence into your aloneness, that would work for you too.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="e388197f-49a4-4dc1-bf87-490ae7131f12" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>From addictive to enlightened relationships</summary><p id="3a9df261-09ce-4e2d-bbb2-6d46d5511b96" class="">Yes. Being present and intensifying your presence by taking your attention ever more deeply into the Now: Whether you are living alone or with a partner, this remains the key. For love to flourish, the light of your presence needs to be strong enough so that you no longer get taken over by the thinker or the pain- body and mistake them for who you are. To know yourself as the Being underneath the thinker, the stillness underneath the mental noise, the love and joy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment. To disidentify from the pain-body is to bring presence into the pain and thus transmute it. To disidentify from thinking is to be the silent watcher of your thoughts and behavior, especially the repetitive patterns of your mind and the roles played by the ego.</p><p id="775ea130-0dbe-45e4-b4f3-d2cbb3e71911" class="">If you stop investing it with &quot;selfness,&quot; the mind loses its compulsive quality, which basically is the compulsion to judge, and so to resist what <em>is, </em>which creates conflict, drama, and new pain. In fact, the moment that judgment stops through acceptance of what <em>is, </em>you are free of the mind. You have made room for love, for joy, for peace. First you stop judging yourself then you stop judging your partner. The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner as he or she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way. That immediately takes you beyond ego. All mind games and all addictive clinging are then over. There are no victims and no perpetrators anymore, no accuser and accused, This is also the end of all codependency, of being drawn into somebody else&#x27;s unconscious pattern and thereby enabling it to continue. You will then either separate -- in love or move ever more deeply into the Now together -- into Being. Can it be that simple? Yes, it is that simple.</p><p id="22e5a79c-0bd6-46c3-866e-3ec63398e3e2" class="">Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some other body, some external form. In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is love.</p><p id="b8d8d78f-c86d-4282-8e94-36158c94524e" class="">What is God? The eternal One Life underneath all the forms of life. What is love? To feel the presence of that One Life deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be it. Therefore, all love is the love of God.</p><p id="c8337ff1-faf4-423a-86cb-2ddc1c9ee6e8" class="">Love is not selective, just as the light of the sun is not selective. It does not make one person special. It is not exclusive. Exclusivity is not the love of God but the &quot;love&quot; of ego. However, the intensity with which true love is felt can vary. There may be one person who reflects your love back to you more dearly and more intensely than others, and if that person feels the same toward you, it can be said that you are in a love relationship with him or her. The bond that connects you with that person is the same bond that connects you with the person sitting next to you on a bus, or with a bird, a tree, a flower. Only the degree of intensity with which it is felt differs.</p><p id="feadcc74-56bc-40d5-ad05-1dcfd1a7b237" class="">Even in an otherwise addictive relationship, there may be moments when something more real shines through, something beyond your mutual addictive needs. These are moments when both your and your partner&#x27;s mind briefly subside and the pain-body is temporarily in a dormant state. This may sometimes happen during physical intimacy, or when you are both witnessing the miracle of childbirth, or in the presence of death, or when one of you is seriously ill -- anything that renders the mind powerless. When this happens, your Being, which is usually buried underneath the mind, becomes revealed, and it is this that makes true communication possible.</p><p id="bf3bea57-8c3e-4aed-8832-f2953562786f" class="">True communication is communion -- the realization of oneness, which is love. Usually, this is quickly lost again, unless you are able to stay present enough to keep out the mind and its old patterns. As soon as the mind and mind identification return, you are no longer yourself but a mental image of yourself, and you start playing games and roles again to get your ego needs met. You are a human mind again, pretending to be a human being, interacting with another mind, playing a drama called &quot;love.&quot;</p><p id="ac3ed87a-e7a4-4218-a728-7153453f0b34" class="">Although brief glimpses are possible, love cannot flourish unless you are permanently free of mind identification and your presence is intense enough to have dissolved the pain-body -- or you can at least remain present as the watcher. The pain-body cannot then take you over and so become destructive of love.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="db802e8c-592d-4c27-b630-1c69007c9d77" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Love/Hate Relationships</summary><p id="7fb2c254-d0f3-45fb-8bb9-d6e3c371cb08" class="">Unless and until you access the consciousness frequency of presence, all relationships, and particularly intimate relationships, are deeply flawed and ultimately dysfunctional. They may seem perfect for a while, such as when you are &quot;in love,&quot; but invariably that apparent perfection gets disrupted as arguments, conflicts, dissatisfaction, and emotional or even physical violence occur with increasing frequency. It seems that most &quot;love relationships&quot; become love/hate relationships before long. Love can then turn into savage attack, feelings of hostility, or complete withdrawal of affection at the flick of a switch. This is considered normal. The relationship then oscillates for a while, a few months or a few years, between the polarities of &quot;love&quot; and hate, and it gives you as much pleasure as it gives you pain. It is not uncommon for couples to become addicted to those cycles. Their drama makes them feel alive. When a balance between the positive/negative polarities is lost and the negative, destructive cycles occur with increasing frequency and intensity, which tends to happen sooner or later, then it will not be long before the relationship finally collapses.</p><p id="5e0be484-2231-4236-b72f-2bc36366b30d" class="">It may appear that if you could only eliminate the negative or destructive cycles, then all would be well and the relationship would flower beautifully -- but alas, this is not possible. The polarities are mutually interdependent. You cannot have one without the other. The positive already contains within itself the as yet unmanifested negative. Both are in fact different aspects of the same dysfunction. I am speaking here of what is commonly called romantic relationships <strong>-- </strong>not of true love, which has no opposite because it arises from beyond the mind. Love as a continuous state is as yet very rare -- as rare as conscious human beings. Brief and elusive glimpses of love, however, are possible whenever there is a gap in the stream of mind.</p><p id="a937fc52-df8c-4281-a621-1ce310045cde" class="">The negative side of a relationship is, of course, more easily recognizable as</p><p id="546b35ce-ee45-49cf-a8c4-cf382d455cc9" class="">dysfunctional than the positive one. And it is also easier to recognize the source of negativity in your partner than to see it in yourself. It can manifest in many forms: possessiveness, jealousy, control, withdrawal and unspoken resentment, the need to be right, insensitivity and self-absorption, emotional demands and manipulation, the urge to argue, criticize, judge, blame, or attack, anger, unconscious revenge for past pain inflicted by a parent, rage and physical violence.</p><p id="61104cd3-5583-4578-9912-ce4e61d433f0" class="">On the positive side, you are <em>&quot;in </em>love&quot; with your partner. This is at first a deeply satisfying state. You feel intensely alive. Your existence has suddenly become meaningful because someone needs you, wants you, and makes you feel special, and you do the same for him or her. When you are together, you feel whole. The feeling can become so intense that the rest of the world fades into insignificance.</p><p id="a039336f-da4a-437a-ae86-912e67c5d6a6" class="">However, you may also have noticed that there is a neediness and a clinging quality to that intensity. You become addicted to the other person. He or she acts on you like a drug. You are on a high when the drug is available, but even the possibility or the thought that he or she might no longer be there for you can lead to jealousy, possessiveness, attempts at manipulation through emotional blackmail, blaming and accusing -- fear of loss. If the other person does leave you, this can give rise to the most intense hostility or the most profound grief and despair. In an instant, loving tenderness can turn into a savage attack or dreadful grief. Where is the love now? Can love change into its opposite in an instant? Was it love in the first place, or just an addictive grasping and clinging?</p></details></li></ul><ul id="beb1a6e3-66cb-4451-a8ae-fd8987371db6" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Psychological Dependence</summary><p id="dec626bd-68e6-4bc0-a8a3-bbd8b5c5832c" class="">Look! I am saying: do you depend psychologically on anybody? If you do, in that there is fear, isn’t there? Because if anything happens to you I am frightened. I become jealous if you look at somebody else. Which means I possess you – right? I depend on you, therefore I must be assured that I possess you in every way, otherwise I am lost. Therefore I am frightened, therefore I become more and more dependent and more and more jealous. So do you depend on anybody? And all this dependence is generally called love, isn’t it?</p><p id="02926133-1d89-4b69-a565-be4fe571b3d3" class="">Relationship between human beings is based on the image-forming, defensive mechanism. In all our relationships each one of us builds an image about the other and these two images have relationship, not the human beings themselves. The wife has an image about the husband – perhaps not consciously but nevertheless it is there – and the husband has an image about the wife. One has an image about one’s country and about oneself, and we are always strengthening these images by adding more and more to them. And it is these images which have relationship. The actual relationship between two human beings or between many human beings completely end when there is the formation of images.</p><p id="728127bf-3f2f-4b50-b429-920cb335bb2a" class="">Relationship based on these images can obviously never bring about peace in the relationship because the images are fictitious and one cannot live in an abstraction. And yet that is what we are all doing: living in ideas, in theories, in symbols, in images which we have created about ourselves and others and which are not realities at all. All our relationships, whether they be with property, ideas or people, are based essentially on this image-forming, and hence there is always conflict.</p><p id="1925da0a-b1b7-4194-8697-651f243be7d8" class="">How is it possible then to be completely at peace within ourselves and in all our relationships with others? After all, life is a movement in relationship, otherwise there is no life at all, and if that life is based on an abstraction, an idea, or a speculative assumption, then such abstract living must inevitably bring about a relationship which becomes a battlefield. So is it at all possible for man to live a completely orderly inward life without any form of compulsion, imitation, suppression or sublimation? Can he bring about such order within himself that it is a living quality not held within the framework of ideas – an inward tranquillity which knows no disturbance at any moment – not in some fantastic mythical abstract world but in the daily life of the home and the office?</p><p id="786fc3ea-7fc9-48da-976f-5f815368704e" class="">I think we should go into this question very carefully because there is not one spot in our consciousness untouched by conflict. In all our relationships, whether with the most intimate person or with a neighbour or with society, this conflict exists – conflict being contradiction, a state of division, separation, a duality. Observing ourselves and our relationships to society we see that at all levels of our being there is conflict – minor or major conflict which brings about very superficial responses or devastating results.</p><p id="473b3393-85e8-4453-945b-3ff4948a46b9" class="">Man has accepted conflict as an innate part of daily existence because he has accepted competition, jealousy, greed, acquisitiveness and aggression as a natural way of life. When we accept such a way of life we accept the structure of society as it is and live within the pattern of respectability. And that is what most of us are caught in because most of us want to be terribly respectable. When we examine our own minds and hearts, the way we think, the way we feel and how we act in our daily lives, we observe that as long as we conform to the pattern of society, life must be a battlefield. If we do not accept it – and no religious person can possibly accept such a society – then we will be completely free from the psychological structure of society.</p><p id="8138305b-f804-4503-bc1b-bc91fba6e802" class="">Most of us are rich with the things of society. What society has created in us and what we have created in ourselves, are greed, envy, anger, hate, jealousy, anxiety – and with all these we are very rich. The various religions throughout the world have preached poverty. The monk assumes a robe, changes his name, shaves his head, enters a cell and takes a vow of poverty and chastity; in the East he has one loin cloth, one robe, one meal a day – and we all respect such poverty. But those men who have assumed the robe of poverty are still inwardly, psychologically, rich with the things of society because they are still seeking position and prestige; they belong to this order or that order, this religion or that religion; they still live in the divisions of a culture, a tradition. That is not poverty. poverty is to be completely free of society, though one may have a few more clothes, a few more meals – good God, who cares? But unfortunately in most people there is this urge for exhibitionism.</p><p id="8f0165c8-cab2-46b1-a064-3d771bd3c852" class="">Poverty becomes a marvellously beautiful thing when the mind is free of society. One must become poor inwardly for then there is no seeking, no asking, no desire, no – nothing! It is only this inward poverty that can see the truth of a life in which there is no conflict at all. Such a life is a benediction not to be found in any church or any temple.</p><p id="774f88da-e2b3-46ff-a821-00b3ed5cd2c6" class="">How is it possible then to free ourselves from the psychological structure of society, which is to free ourselves from the essence of conflict? It is not difficult to trim and lop off certain branches of conflict, but we are asking ourselves whether it is possible to live in complete inward and therefore outward tranquillity? Which does not mean that we shall vegetate or stagnate. On the contrary, we shall become dynamic, vital, full of energy.</p><p id="930308ba-4c9e-41fb-be54-79191d077c68" class="">To understand and to be free of any problem we need a great deal of passionate and sustained energy, not only physical and intellectual energy but an energy that is not dependent on any motive, any psychological stimulus or drug. If we are dependent on any stimulus that very stimulus makes the mind dull and insensitive. By taking some form of drug we may find enough energy temporarily to see things very clearly but we revert to our former state and therefore become dependent on that drug more and more. So all stimulation, whether of the church or of alcohol or of drugs or of the written or spoken word, will inevitably bring about dependence, and that dependence prevents us from seeing clearly for ourselves and therefore from having vital energy.</p><p id="2d8330f3-7392-410e-805e-3a413692873a" class="">We all unfortunately depend psychologically on something. Why do we depend? Why is there this urge to depend? We are taking this journey together; you are not waiting for me to tell you the causes of your dependence. If we enquire together we will both discover and therefore that discovery will be your own, and hence, being yours, it will give you vitality.</p><p id="bb8505da-cecf-4a63-88a6-aefc5c0b1de2" class="">I discover for myself that I depend on something – an audience, say, which will stimulate me. I derive from that audience, from addressing a large group of people, a kind of energy. And therefore I depend on that audience, on those people, whether they agree or disagree. The more they disagree the more vitality they give me. If they agree it becomes a very shallow, empty thing. So I discover that I need an audience because it is a very stimulating thing to address people. Now why? Why do I depend? Because in myself I am shallow, in myself I have nothing, in myself I have no source which is always full and rich, vital, moving, living. So I depend. I have discovered the cause.</p><p id="a113b2cc-c8d9-4f1a-b692-15ed753d117e" class="">But will the discovery of the cause free me from being dependent? The discovery of the cause is merely intellectual, so obviously it does not free the mind from its dependency. The mere intellectual acceptance of an idea, or the emotional acquiescence in an ideology, cannot free the mind from being dependent on something which will give it stimulation. What frees the mind from dependence is seeing the whole structure and nature of stimulation and dependence and how that dependence makes the mind stupid, dull and inactive. Seeing the totality of it alone frees the mind.</p><p id="a3f71c7b-25bc-431f-b013-a4be6f44ff88" class="">So I must enquire into what it means to see totally. As long as I am looking at life from a particular point of view or from a particular experience I have cherished, or from some particular knowledge I have gathered, which is my background, which is the ‘me’, I cannot totally. I have discovered intellectually, verbally, through analysis, the cause of my dependence, but whatever thought investigates must inevitably be fragmentary, so I can see the totality of something only when thought does not interfere.</p><p id="9e597bcf-b0bc-44ea-86a9-8a4e483a2c16" class="">Then I see the fact of my dependence; I see actually what is. I see it without any like or dislike; I do not want to get rid of that dependence or to be free from the cause of it. I observe it, and when there is observation of this kind I see the whole picture, not a fragment of the picture, and when the mind sees the whole picture there is freedom. Now I have discovered that there is a dissipation of energy when there is fragmentation. I have found the very source of the dissipation of energy.</p><p id="7fac2353-4adc-41a4-9f0b-a31c2324f8bf" class="">You may think there is no waste of energy if you imitate, if you accept authority, if you depend on the priest, the ritual, the dogma, the party or on some ideology, but the following and acceptance of an ideology, whether it is good or bad, whether it is holy or unholy, is a fragmentary activity and therefore a cause of conflict, and conflict will inevitably arise so long as there is a division between ‘what should be’ and ‘what is’, and any conflict is a dissipation of energy.</p><p id="1407bda2-0bb6-49a4-803e-dd39bbb222a5" class="">If you put the question to yourself, ‘How am I to be free from conflict?’, you are creating another problem and hence you are increasing conflict, whereas if you just see it as a fact – see it as you would see some concrete object – clearly, directly – then you will understand essentially the truth of a life in which there is no conflict at all.</p><p id="61c99393-5492-42f3-aa50-3bba56c73f52" class="">Let us put it another way. We are always comparing what we are with what we should be. The should-be is a projection of what we think we ought to be. Contradiction exists when there is comparison, not only with something or somebody, but with what you were yesterday, and hence there is conflict between what has been and what is. There is what is only when there is no comparison at all, and to live with what is, is to be peaceful. Then you can give your whole attention without any distraction to what is within yourself – whether it be despair, ugliness, brutality, fear, anxiety, loneliness – and live with it completely; then there is no contradiction and hence no conflict.</p><p id="e885e9d9-afa9-4384-8c7f-97e264bed10e" class="">But all the time we are comparing ourselves – with those who are richer or more brilliant, more intellectual, more affectionate, more famous, more this and more that. The ‘more’ plays an extraordinarily important part in our lives; this measuring ourselves all the time against something or someone is one of the primary causes of conflict.</p><p id="8a60a605-98fe-4c64-9c95-9278944c1ea0" class="">Now why is there any comparison at all? Why do you compare yourself with another? This comparison has been taught from childhood. In every school A is compared with B, and A destroys himself in order to be like B. When you do not compare at all, when there is no ideal, no opposite, no factor of duality, when you no longer struggle to be different from what you are – what has happened to your mind? Your mind has ceased to create the opposite and has become highly intelligent, highly sensitive, capable of immense passion, because effort is a dissipation of passion – passion which is vital energy – and you cannot do anything without passion.</p><p id="af4d4c7b-760f-49be-be44-5b0e00a66de0" class="">If you do not compare yourself with another you will be what you are. Through comparison you hope to evolve, to grow, to become more intelligent, more beautiful. But will you? The fact is what you are, and by comparing you are fragmenting the fact which is a waste of energy. To see what you actually are without any comparison gives you tremendous energy to look. When you can look at yourself without comparison you are beyond comparison, which does not mean that the mind is stagnant with contentment. So we see in essence how the mind wastes energy which is so necessary to understand the totality of life.</p><p id="471c0499-bfa1-4c44-83d3-9790fc5f4ed1" class="">I don’t want to know with whom I am in conflict; I don’t want to know the peripheral conflicts of my being. What I want to know is why conflict should exist at all. When I put that question to myself I see a fundamental issue which has nothing to do with peripheral conflicts and their solutions. I am concerned with the central issue and I see – perhaps you see also? – that the very nature of desire, if not properly understood, must inevitably lead to conflict.</p><p id="584c7795-2122-4fc2-90e9-e91d0b2cf2d5" class="">Desire is always in contradiction. I desire contradictory things – which doesn’t mean that I must destroy desire, suppress, control or sublimate it – I simply see that desire itself is contradictory. It is not the objects of desire but the very nature of desire which is contradictory. And I have to understand the nature of desire before I can understand conflict. In ourselves we are in a state of contradiction, and that state of contradiction is brought about by desire – desire being the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, which we have already been into.</p><p id="60cce2bb-736d-47b0-8237-fb9c40fc9438" class="">So we see desire as the root of all contradiction – wanting something and not wanting it – a dual activity. When we do something pleasurable there is no effort involved at all, is there? But pleasure brings pain and then there is a struggle to avoid the pain, and that again is a dissipation of energy. Why do we have duality at all? There is, of course, duality in nature – man and woman, light and shade, night and day – but inwardly, psychologically, why do we have duality? Please think this out with me, don’t wait for me to tell you. You have to exercise your own mind to find out. My words are merely a mirror in which to observe yourself. Why do we have this psychological duality? Is it that we have been brought up always to compare ‘what is’ with ‘what should be’? We have been conditioned in what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad, what is moral and what is immoral. Has this duality come into being because we believe that thinking about the opposite of violence, the opposite of envy, of jealousy, of meanness, will help us to get rid of those things? Do we use the opposite as a lever to get rid of what is? Or is it an escape from the actual?</p><p id="2832bb73-137d-4170-bf3c-b018c1ad8a45" class="">Do you use the opposite as a means of avoiding the actual which you don’t know how to deal with? Or is it because you have been told by thousands of years of propaganda that you must have an ideal – the opposite of ‘what is’ – in order to cope with the present? When you have an ideal you think it helps you to get rid of ‘what is’, but it never does. You may preach non-violence for the rest of your life and all the time be sowing the seeds of violence.</p><p id="346ded2f-6da4-4c07-8ef7-73024d086289" class="">You have a concept of what you should be and how you should act, and all the time you are in fact acting quite differently; so you see that principles, beliefs and ideals must inevitably lead to hypocrisy and a dishonest life. It is the ideal that creates the opposite to what is, so if you know how to be with ‘what is’, then the opposite is not necessary.</p><p id="9983ee14-953d-4935-a1b6-ceeb0340e6dd" class="">Trying to become like somebody else, or like your ideal, is one of the main causes of contradiction, confusion conflict. A mind that is confused, whatever it does, at any level, will remain confused; any action born of confusion leads to further confusion. I see this very clearly; I see it as clearly as I see an immediate physical danger. So what happens? I cease to act in terms of confusion any more. Therefore inaction is complete action.</p></details></li></ul><h1 id="45e8b89a-56f0-4df1-a872-c275ae3c5072" class="">Suffering and Pain</h1><ul id="222e4c54-44c6-4d2d-93ab-57b7f2c17cdf" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Creating Pain</summary><p id="6c336791-c666-48d1-8d21-3a852efdbf4f" class="">The greater part of human pain is unnecessary.

On the emotional level, it is some <em>form </em>of negativity. The <em>intensity </em>of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment, and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind. The mind always seeks to deny the Now and to escape from it. In other words, the more you are identified with your mind, the more you suffer. Or you may put it like this: the more you are able to honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering -- and free of the egoic mind.</p><p id="c466e085-614c-462e-b0f8-50610d6705e5" class="">Why does the mind habitually deny or resist the <em>Now? </em>Because it cannot function and remain in control without time, which is past and future, so it perceives the timeless Now as threatening.

An increasingly heavy burden of time has been accumulating in the human mind. All individuals are suffering under this burden, but they also keep adding to it every moment whenever they ignore or deny that precious moment or reduce it to a means of getting to some future moment, which only exists in the mind, never in actuality. The accumulation of time in the collective and individual human mind also holds a vast amount of residual pain from the past.</p><p id="671566a2-2c70-4d4a-be9f-8935f9f671f4" class="">If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, if you no longer want to add to the residue of past pain that still lives on in you, then don&#x27;t create any more time, or at least no more than is necessary to deal with the practical aspects of your life. How to stop creating time? Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say &quot;yes&quot; to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to something that already <em>is? </em>What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now?

It merges with the pain from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodged in your mind and body. This, of course, includes the pain you suffered as a child, caused by the unconsciousness of the world into which you were born.</p><p id="c49ea69f-d86a-44d3-a595-c733dc7f388a" class="">This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies your body and mind. If you look on it as an invisible entity in its own right, you are getting quite close to the truth. It&#x27;s the emotional pain body. It has two modes of being: dormant and active. A pain-body may be dormant 9° percent of the time; in a deeply unhappy person, though, it may be active up to too percent of the time. Some people live almost entirely through their pain-body, while others may experience it only in certain situations, such as intimate relationships, or situations linked with past loss or abandonment, physical or emotional hurt, and so on. Anything can trigger it, particularly if it resonates with a pain pattern from your past. When it is ready to awaken from its dormant stage, even a thought or an innocent remark made by someone dose to you can activate it.</p><p id="fb1517ba-3013-4fe3-a849-a00c4bc1c6b1" class="">Some pain-bodies are obnoxious but relatively harmless, for example like a child who won&#x27;t stop whining. Others are vicious and destructive monsters, true demons. Some are physically violent; many more are emotionally violent. Some will attack people around you or dose to you, while others may attack you, their host. Thoughts and feelings you have about your life then become deeply negative and self-destructive. Illnesses and accidents are often created in this way. Some pain-bodies drive their hosts to suicide.</p><p id="039b57cb-3dd6-42f3-96bf-b0d45e7e475f" class="">When you thought you knew a person and then you are suddenly confronted with this alien, nasty creature for the first time, you are in for quite a shock. However, it&#x27;s more important to observe it in yourself than in someone else. Watch out for any sign of unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form -- it may be the awakening pain-body. This can take the form of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire to hurt, anger, rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your relationship, and so on. Catch it the moment it awakens from its dormant state.</p><p id="fd6503e2-df1d-4b7d-aabe-b2896083d380" class="">The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, &quot;become you,&quot; and live through you. It needs to get its &quot;food&quot; through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite indigestible.</p><p id="05a2cc99-506b-477b-9102-96a3c9ef771b" class="">Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn&#x27;t really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and others. If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane.</p><p id="0fb5000d-3dec-41f6-b6b4-b41724abf278" class="">The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. But if you don&#x27;t face it, if you don&#x27;t bring the light of your consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence.</p><p id="7e1bcc14-8eaf-4661-8727-d9ccf6769806" class="">Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn&#x27;t make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can <em>realize </em>this truth -- that is, make it real in your own experience.</p><p id="533dedec-1e86-4293-b4a7-06666f3f8c8c" class="">So the pain-body doesn&#x27;t want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it <em>presence. </em>You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength. You have accessed the power of Now.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="4d4d17cf-ce19-4ebf-ae5d-c8ea0d8934b2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Breaking Identification with the Pain Body</summary><p id="556180ba-01a6-4af3-bac4-420626cf140c" class="">Unconsciousness creates it; consciousness transmutes it into itself. St. Paul expressed this universal principle beautifully: &quot;Everything is shown up by being exposed to the light, and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light.&quot; lust as you cannot fight the darkness, you cannot fight the pain-body. Trying to do so would create inner conflict and thus further pain. Watching it is enough. Watching it implies accepting it as part of what <em>is </em>at that <em>moment.</em></p><p id="af665a0e-3730-47c0-809e-dff3fda5585b" class="">The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your total energy field and has temporarily become autonomous through the unnatural process of mind identification. It has turned in on itself and become anti-life, like an animal trying to devour its own tail. Why do you think our civilization has become so life-destructive? But even the life-destructive forces are still life- energy.</p><p id="1450bd1f-2c57-45e9-b87e-c21e1c8f4a16" class="">When you start to disidentify and become the watcher, the pain- body will continue to operate for a while and will try to trick you into identifying with it again. Although you are no longer energizing it through your identification, it has a certain momentum, just like a spinning wheel that will keep turning for a while even when it is no longer being propelled. At this stage, it may also create physical aches and pains in different parts of the body, but they won&#x27;t last. Stay present, stay conscious. Be the ever-alert guardian of your inner space. You need to be present enough to be able to watch the pain-body directly and feel its energy. It then cannot control your thinking. The moment your thinking is aligned with the energy field of the pain- body, you are identified with it and again feeding it with your thoughts.</p><p id="222b2aae-bf60-41d3-915b-78789676e80e" class="">For example, if anger is the predominant energy vibration of the pain-body and you think angry thoughts, dwelling on what someone did to you or what you are going to do to him or her, then you have become unconscious, and the pain-body has become &quot;you.&quot; Where there is anger, there is always pain underneath. Or when a dark mood comes upon you and you start getting into a negative mind- pattern and thinking how dreadful your life is, your thinking has become aligned with the pain-body, and you have become unconscious and vulnerable to the pain-body&#x27;s attack. &quot;Unconscious,&quot; the way that I use the word here, means to be identified with some mental or emotional pattern. It implies a complete absence of the watcher.</p><p id="61d6fc7a-2c37-4952-923b-a79b1d2b0092" class="">Sustained conscious attention severs the link between the pain- body and your thought processes and brings about the process of transmutation. It is as if the pain becomes fuel for the flame of your consciousness, which then burns more brightly as a result. This is the esoteric meaning of the ancient art of alchemy: the transmutation of base metal into gold, of suffering into consciousness. The split within is healed, and you become whole again. Your responsibility then is not to create further pain.</p><p id="e0b35f3d-a951-42ca-a102-e529e4395c54" class="">Let me summarize the process. Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don&#x27;t <em>think </em>about it -- don&#x27;t let the feeling turn into thinking. Don&#x27;t judge or analyze. Don&#x27;t make an identity for yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you. Become aware not only of the emotional pain but also of &quot;the one who <em>observes,&quot; </em>the silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the power of your own conscious presence.

I will talk about this and the reason for it in more detail later. Right now, let me just say this: If you are able to stay alert and present at that time and <em>watch </em>whatever you feel within, rather than be taken over by it, it affords an opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all past pain becomes possible.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="ce6e28fb-c032-43ab-996c-1e8f09ee6c28" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Ego Identification with the Pain Body</summary><p id="7117d2f0-17ee-4ede-adaa-04125d492a56" class="">The process that I have just described is profoundly powerful yet simple. It could be taught to a child, and hopefully one day it will be one of the first things children learn in school. Once you have understood the basic principle of being present as the watcher of what happens inside you -- and you &quot;understand&quot; it by experiencing it -- you have at your disposal the most potent transformational tool.</p><p id="bf38e807-7424-4682-b837-e361f38d2386" class="">This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner resistance to disidentifying from your pain. This will be the case particularly if you have lived closely identified with your emotional pain-body for most of your life and the whole or a large part of your sense of self is invested in it. What this means is that you have made an unhappy self out of your pain-body and believe that this mind-made fiction is who you are. In that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will create strong resistance to any disidentification. In other words, you would rather be in pain -- be the pain-body -- than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing the familiar unhappy self.</p><p id="affcbc93-4bba-4296-8b6b-0a1688dbb929" class="">If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself. Observe the attachment to your pain. Be very alert. Observe the peculiar pleasure you derive from being unhappy. Observe the compulsion to talk or think about it. The resistance will cease if you make it conscious. You can then take your attention into the pain-body, stay present as the witness, and so initiate its transmutation.</p><p id="aa4699d2-efe6-49cd-95e4-15a056f4ef67" class="">Only you can do this. Nobody can do <em>it for </em>you. But if you are fortunate enough to find someone who is intensely conscious, if you can be with them and join them in the state of presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things. In this way, your own light will quickly grow stronger. When a log that has only just started to burn is placed next to one that is burning fiercely, and after a while they are separated again, the first log will be burning with much greater intensity. After all, it is the same fire. To be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher. Some therapists may also be able to fulfill that function, provided that they have gone beyond the level of mind and <em>can </em>create and <em>sustain </em>a state of intense <em>conscious </em>presence while they are working with you.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="9961f628-0607-46ce-9217-d13c45fa8ac8" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Freedom from Unhappiness</summary><p id="b265a153-7167-49b6-8cbc-1ee2f379d468" class="">Do you resent doing what you are doing?

Is there even the slightest trace of resentment, unwillingness? If there is, observe it on both the mental and the emotional levels. What thoughts is your mind creating around this situation? Then look at the emotion, which is the body&#x27;s reaction to those thoughts. Feel the emotion. Does it feel pleasant or unpleasant?

You are creating unhappiness, conflict between the inner and the outer. Your unhappiness is polluting not only your own inner being and those around you but also the collective human psyche of which you are an inseparable part.

Recognizing its futility is important. Negativity is never the optimum way of dealing with any situation. In fact, in most cases it keeps you stuck in it, blocking real change. Anything that is done with negative energy will become contaminated by it and in time give rise to more pain, more unhappiness.

What do you need problems for? The mind unconsciously loves problems because they give you an identity of sorts. This is normal, and it is insane. &quot;Problem&quot; means that you are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a true intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of life, of Being.

When everything is established and there is no crisis things are dead. When nothing is changing and the grip of the old is perfect, it is almost impossible to change yourself. When everything is in a chaos, nothing is static, nothing is secure, nobody knows what is going to happen the next moment – in such a chaotic moment – you are free, you can change. You can attain to the innermost core of your being.</p><p id="a05369d6-c32e-4d98-83a9-741dc8334d92" class="">It is just like in a prison: when everything is settled it is almost impossible for any prisoner to get out of it, to escape from the prison. But just think: there has been an earthquake and everything is disturbed and nobody knows where the guards are and nobody knows where the jailer is, and all rules have dissolved, and everybody is running on his own – in that moment if a prisoner is a little alert he can escape very easily; if he is foolish, only then will he miss the opportunity.</p><p id="2afbe884-a761-479b-a410-a388a078897c" class="">When the society is in a turmoil and everything is in crisis, a chaos pervades – this is the moment, if you want, you can escape from the prison.

This is the moment. Don’t miss that moment.</p><p id="48553bc0-314f-44c3-b991-e57543768c17" class="">In great crisis periods, always, much enlightenment has happened. When the society is established and it is almost impossible to rebel, to go beyond, not to follow the rules, enlightenment becomes very, very difficult – because it is freedom; it is anarchy. In fact it is moving away from society and becoming individual. The society doesn’t like individuals: it likes robots who just look like individuals but are not individuals. The society doesn’t like authentic being. It likes masks, pretenders, hypocrites, but not real persons because a real person is always trouble. A real person is always a free person. You cannot enforce things on him; you cannot make a prisoner out of him; you cannot enslave him. He would like to lose his life, but he would not like to lose his freedom. Freedom is more valuable to him than life itself. Freedom is the highest value for him. That’s why in India we have called the highest value <em>moksha, nirvana</em>; those words mean freedom – total freedom – absolute freedom.</p><p id="68b9f3e8-4bb7-435e-8023-4a525c14492c" class="">Whenever society is in a turmoil and everybody is tending his own business – has to tend – escape.

It always comes in a circle; the circle completes in twenty-five centuries. Just as a circle completes in one year – again summer comes back, one year’s circle and the summer is back – there is a great circle of twenty-five centuries. Every time after twenty-five centuries, the old foundations dissolve; the society has to lay new foundations. The whole edifice becomes worthless; it has to be demolished. Then economic, social, political, religious – all systems – are disturbed. The new is to be born; it is a birth pain.</p><p id="b6a89ee1-3270-470c-b7f3-195ac452efc3" class="">There are two possibilities. One is the possibility that you may start fixing the old falling structure: you may become a social servant and you may start making things more stable. Then you miss, because nothing can be done: the society is dying. Every society has a life-span and every culture has a life-span. As a child is born and we know the child will become a youth, will become old, and will die – seventy years, eighty years, at the most a hundred years – every society is born, is young, becomes old, has to die. Every civilization that is born has to die. These critical moments are moments of the death of the past, the old; moments of the birth of the new. You should not bother; you should not start supporting the old structure – it is going to die. If you are supporting, you may be crushed under it. This is one possibility: that you start supporting the structure. That is not going to work. You will miss the opportunity.</p><p id="7150ac81-2630-4f54-8397-87565eefd2f1" class="">Then there is another possibility: you may start a social revolution to bring the new. Then, too, again you will miss the opportunity, because the new is going to come. You need not bring it. The new is already coming – don’t bother about it; don’t become a revolutionary. The new will come. If the old is gone nobody can force it to remain, and if the new is there and the time has reached and the child is ripe in the womb, the child is going to be born. You need not try any Caesarean operation. The child is going to be born; don’t bother about it. Revolution goes on happening by itself; it is a natural phenomenon. No revolutionaries are needed. You need not kill the person; he is going to die himself. If you start working for a social revolution – you become a communist, a socialist – you will miss.</p><p id="13e2c770-cc37-4bb2-a68f-6878365de983" class="">These are the two alternatives in which you can miss. Or you can use this time of crisis and be transformed, use it for your individual growth. There is nothing like a critical moment in history: everything is tense and everything is intense, and everything has come to a moment, to a peak, from where the wheel will turn. Use this door, this opportunity, and be transformed. That’s why my emphasis is for individual revolution.</p><p id="46e50168-8570-40eb-9d7f-617257093b24" class="">Life unfolds between the polarities of order and chaos. It is important at this time to recognize these two fundamental opposites, without which the world could not even be. Another word for disorder is “adversity.” When it becomes more extreme, we might call it “chaos.”</p><p id="763e3aa7-f7b9-49d8-bae4-0d1fb5014057" class="">We would prefer, of course, to have order in our lives, which means to have things going well. We would like relative harmony in our lives. Yet, that very often is marred by the eruption of some form of disorder. And, usually, we resent that—we get angry, or despondent, or sad.</p><p id="98769398-a408-41d1-a4d3-a214a4cf1304" class="">Disorder comes in many, many forms, big and small. When disorder comes it usually creates a kind of havoc in our lives, accompanied by strong underlying beliefs. “There’s something very wrong, this should not be happening, maybe God is against me,” and so on. Again, we need to understand that disorder, or adversity, is inevitable and is an essential part of a higher order.</p><p id="37480f7b-47c5-4211-a358-8d581f0bd352" class="">From a higher perspective, a higher level, the existence of order and disorder, or order and chaos, is a necessary part of the evolution of life.</p><p id="38f33ced-b855-460f-b6fc-741e1a97797e" class="">Many people have found that they experience a deepening, or a deeper sense of self or beingness, immediately after and as a result of having endured a period of disorder or chaos. This is sometimes called “the dark night of the soul,” a term from medieval Christianity used to describe the mental breakdown that many mystics experienced prior to awakening spiritually. There was an eruption of disorder, of destruction. Then, out of that, a deeper realization arose.</p><p id="0c425c44-0b69-4461-9fe2-e6c8e1f713c0" class="">And although that can be very painful, the strange thing is, it’s precisely there that many humans experience a transcendence. A strange fact is that it almost never happens that people awaken spiritually while they’re in their comfort zone. Or that they become deeper as human beings, which would be a partial awakening. It almost never happens. The place where the evolutionary shift happens, or the evolutionary leap, is usually the experience of disorder in a person’s life.</p><p id="cfe55a23-e7f9-49ac-accf-c2de3fab4bb5" class="">And so your life then moves between order and disorder. You have both, and they’re both necessary. There’s no guarantee that when disorder erupts this will bring about an awakening or a deepening, but there’s always the possibility. It is an opportunity, but often, it is missed.</p><p id="ad2e1266-0ed5-4693-81a4-049b1bbc3175" class="">So here we are at this time, and our mission is the same: to align with the present moment, with whatever is happening here and now. The upheaval that we’re experiencing at the present time probably will not be the last upheaval that’s going to come on a collective level. However, it is an opportunity—because although this is a time for upheavals, it is also a time for awakening. The two go together. Just as in an individual life, you need adversity to awaken. It’s an opportunity but not a guarantee. And so what looks tragic and unpleasant on a conventional level is actually perfectly fine and as it should be on a higher level; it would not be happening otherwise. It’s all part of the awakening of human beings and of planetary awakening.</p><p id="46c9853e-803a-43e9-80c6-a5a5c869d682" class="">

It is a term used to describe what one could call a collapse of a perceived meaning in life…an eruption into your life of a deep sense of meaninglessness.  The inner state in some cases is very close to what is conventionally called depression. Nothing makes sense anymore, there’s no purpose to anything. Sometimes it’s triggered by some external event, some disaster perhaps, on an external level.  The death of someone close to you could trigger it, especially premature death, for example if your child dies. Or you had built up your life, and given it meaning – and the meaning that you had given your life, your activities, your achievements, where you are going, what is considered important, and the meaning that you had given your life for some reason collapses.</p><p id="5d139b7e-6a99-404b-ac89-a09cfcd1dbb8" class="">It can happen if something happens that you can’t explain away anymore, some disaster which seems to invalidate the meaning that your life had before.  Really what has collapsed then is the whole conceptual framework for your life, the meaning that your mind had given it. So that results in a dark place.  But people have gone into that, and then there is the possibility that you emerge out of that into a transformed state of consciousness. Life has meaning again, but it’s no longer a conceptual meaning that you can necessarily explain.  Quite often it’s from there that people awaken out of their conceptual sense of reality, which has collapsed.</p><p id="bfe85ffc-e234-40a3-9737-1d35f84b73ec" class="">They awaken into something deeper, which is no longer based on concepts in your mind.  A deeper sense of purpose or connectedness with a greater life that is not dependent on explanations or anything conceptual any longer.  It’s a kind of re-birth. The dark night of the soul is a kind of death that you die. What dies is the egoic sense of self. Of course, death is always painful, but nothing real has actually died there – only an illusory identity.  Now it is probably the case that some people who’ve gone through this transformation realized that they had to go through that, in order to bring about a spiritual awakening. Often it is part of the awakening process, the death of the old self and the birth of the true self.</p><p id="cd82d11a-474d-4cb4-b50c-fb1af9ce2e77" class="">The first lesson in <em>A Course in Miracles</em> says “Nothing I see in this room means anything”, and you’re supposed to look around the room at whatever you happen to be looking at, and you say “this doesn’t mean anything”, “that doesn’t mean anything”.   What is the purpose of a lesson like that? It’s a little bit like re-creating what can happen during the dark night of the soul. It’s the collapse of a mind-made meaning, conceptual meaning, of life… believing that you understand “what it’s all about”.  With A Course in Miracles, it’s a voluntary relinquishment of the human mind-made meaning that is projected, and you go voluntary into saying “I don’t know what this means”, “this doesn’t mean anything”. You wipe the board clean. In the dark night of the soul it collapses.</p><p id="594faf72-a607-4335-a8be-ca3ffe58f767" class="">You are meant to arrive at a place of conceptual meaninglessness.  Or one could say a state of ignorance – where things lose the meaning that you had given them, which was all conditioned and cultural and so on.  Then you can look upon the world without imposing a mind-made framework of meaning. It looks of course as if you no longer understand anything. That’s why it’s so scary when it happens to you, instead of you actually consciously embracing it.  It can bring about the dark night of the soul – to go around the Universe without any longer interpreting it compulsively, as an innocent presence. You look upon events, people, and so on with a deep sense of aliveness. Your sense the aliveness through your own sense of aliveness, but you are not trying to fit your experience into a conceptual framework anymore.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="e4393e4e-de21-4b95-aa9d-965d74625402" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Is Suffering Part of Growth?</summary><p id="57ce06f2-d70e-462b-a120-d197628dca06" class="">Suffering in personal growth is not an inherent part of the process but arises from one&#x27;s resistance to it. The resistance comes from fear, indecision, and a lack of wholehearted commitment to the growth. This inner conflict divides individuals and causes suffering. To avoid suffering and facilitate growth, three key principles should be kept in mind.</p><p id="78e2b77a-f71f-4f35-962c-acbd6089708d" class="">Firstly, individuals should let go of their past as it is the source of much resistance. The past creates judgments, expectations, and comparisons that hinder personal growth. Letting go of the past can alleviate much suffering.</p><p id="ac4a80c7-5910-4958-80dc-eff69dafa75d" class="">Secondly, people should avoid creating rigid expectations for the future. Expectations often lead to disappointment and frustration when reality doesn&#x27;t align with them. Surrendering to the flow of life without preconceived notions can reduce suffering.</p><p id="16e291e8-b748-492a-a838-a5ab8e55d727" class="">Lastly, a synthesis of extroversion and introversion is crucial for holistic growth. Eastern methods tend to promote introversion, leading to isolation, while Western methods emphasize extroversion but may overlook inner growth. Combining both approaches allows individuals to fluidly move between inner and outer experiences, transcending categorizations and experiencing freedom.</p><p id="89fd1240-5c8d-4dae-85bb-70651029c45a" class="">It is important to recognize that suffering in personal growth is not inevitable; it results from a lack of awareness of one&#x27;s responsibility and resistance to change. Embracing these principles can help alleviate suffering and lead to a more balanced and fulfilled life.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="9c5d7bd9-7a6f-45ba-8ad1-6649a6849dd2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Anger</summary><p id="e369fd80-a07c-4a1a-a17d-13c2456a724a" class=""><strong>Anger has that peculiar quality of isolation; like sorrow, it cuts one off, and for the time being, at least, all relationship comes to an end. Anger has the temporary strength and vitality of the isolated. There is a strange despair in anger; for isolation is despair. The anger of disappointment, of jealousy, of the urge to wound, gives a violent release whose pleasure is self-justification. We condemn others, and that very condemnation is a justification of ourselves. Without some kind of attitude, whether of self-righteousness or self-abasement, what are we? We use every means to bolster ourselves up; and anger, like hate, is one of the easiest ways. Simple anger, a sudden flare-up which is quickly forgotten, is one thing; but the anger that is deliberately built up, that has been brewed and that seeks to hurt and destroy, is quite another matter. Simple anger may have some physiological cause which can be seen and remedied; but the anger that is the outcome of a psychological cause is much more subtle and difficult to deal with. Most of us do not mind being angry, we find an excuse for it. Why should we not be angry when there is ill-treatment of another or of ourselves? So we become righteously angry. We never just say we are angry, and stop there; we go into elaborate explanations of its cause. We never just say that we are jealous or bitter, but justify or explain it. We ask how there can be love without jealousy, or say that someone else’s actions have made us bitter, and so on.</strong></p><p id="8f242fe3-dab1-49a8-9294-b04c1de6ad1f" class=""><strong>It is the explanation, the verbalization, whether silent or spoken, that sustains anger, that gives it scope and depth. The explanation silent or spoken, acts as a shield against the discovery of ourselves as we are. We want to be praised or flattered, we expect something; and when these things do not take place, we are disappointed, we become bitter or jealous. Then, violently or softly, we blame someone else; we say the other is responsible for our bitterness. You are of great significance because I depend upon you for my happiness, for my position or prestige. Through you, I fulfil, so you are important to me; I must guard you, I must possess you. Through you, I escape from myself; and when I am thrown back upon myself, being fearful of my own state, I become angry. Anger takes many forms: disappointment, resentment, bitterness, jealousy, and so on.</strong></p><p id="06b1f957-0d85-46da-aecf-c66540d714cf" class=""><strong>The storing up of anger, which is resentment, requires the antidote of forgiveness; but the storing up of anger is far more significant than forgiveness. Forgiveness is unnecessary when there is no accumulation of anger. Forgiveness is essential if there is resentment; but to be free from flattery and from the sense of injury, without the hardness of indifference, makes for mercy, charity. Anger cannot be got rid of by the action of will, for will is part of violence. Will is the outcome of desire, the craving to lie; and desire in its very nature is aggressive, dominant. To suppress anger by the exertion of will is to transfer anger to a different level, giving it a different name; but it is still part of violence. To be free from violence, which is not the cultivation of non-violence, there must be the understanding of desire. There is no spiritual substitute for desire; it cannot be suppressed or sublimated. There must be a silent and choiceless awareness of desire; and this passive awareness is the direct experiencing of desire without an experiencer giving it a name.</strong></p></details></li></ul><ul id="84ede0c8-8811-4743-8ab8-1d137a6aebdc" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Being Hurt</strong></summary><p id="15535adb-3589-4989-9233-37ee3fcb79c9" class="">In our journey through life, we encounter moments that leave indelible marks on the canvas of our being. These marks, or hurts, shape our interactions with the world, dictating the construction of walls around our psyche, ostensibly to protect us, yet ironically, imprisoning us within our own vulnerabilities. The discussion here delves into the nature of hurt, the concept of the self as the observer, and the path to transcending this cycle of pain.</p><h3 id="0f127dd7-b404-47db-aa10-837721538040" class="">The Observer and the Observed</h3><p id="eb09a6fa-3869-41df-9496-624ee91e619b" class="">At the heart of our understanding of hurt lies the distinction between the observer and the observed. We often perceive ourselves, the observer, as separate from our experiences, the observed. This duality is the crux of our suffering. When we experience pain, it is not merely an external event impacting us but a deep resonance within the very fabric of our identity. The observer, or the self, is not a bystander to pain but its very embodiment. The realization that the observer is the observed dissolves the distance we place between ourselves and our experiences, thereby nullifying the conflict that perpetuates hurt.</p><h3 id="889859be-92a5-4042-8504-8ffe3a364086" class="">The Nature of Hurt</h3><p id="43cc7da7-be9f-4ab6-b2c6-b7a26e72ae71" class="">Hurt, in its essence, is not an external imposition but a disruption of the self&#x27;s narrative, a dent in the image we hold of ourselves. This image, constructed over time through experiences, expectations, and societal norms, becomes the lens through which we view the world. When this image is challenged or negated, it manifests as hurt. The hurt is not merely an emotional response but a challenge to the self&#x27;s existence as we perceive it.</p><h3 id="19eee376-57c5-47ee-8839-647a3a83db86" class="">The Illusion of Effort and Resolution</h3><p id="2312ea76-b73f-439b-9c06-1342d183f7c5" class="">The natural inclination to resolve hurt through effort, to &#x27;do something&#x27; about the pain, further entangles us in the web of suffering. This effort, whether it be to retaliate, to withdraw, or to seek solace, stems from the illusion of the self as separate from its experiences. It is a futile attempt to mend the image that has been disrupted. However, when we understand that the self and its experiences are not distinct but one, the need for resolution through effort dissipates. The pain, once seen as an integral part of our being, loses its power to hurt.</p><h3 id="ef3ae12a-4cc1-472c-b842-273c8b571b0a" class="">Beyond Hurt: The State of Complete Attention</h3><p id="0494c5f2-9cd7-4924-aa06-840fe1360942" class="">The pivotal moment in transcending hurt is the state of complete attention. In this state, there is no division between the observer and the observed; there is only the totality of the experience. This undivided attention does not seek to alter, to retaliate, or to escape from what is. It is in this totality of attention that the energy which was once dissipated in the effort to resolve hurt is now consolidated, allowing for a profound observation of the self. This observation, free from the constraints of the self&#x27;s narrative, enables a transformation where hurt no longer finds a foothold.</p><h3 id="0bd5e912-bd6d-47a6-9f62-841d2f2527b9" class="">The Liberation from Hurt</h3><p id="9e7f751d-e3eb-44a7-ab0c-8cb47a934ab0" class="">The liberation from hurt is not a process of accumulation - of more knowledge, experiences, or techniques for emotional management. It is, paradoxically, a process of subtraction, of peeling away the layers of the self that we have constructed. It is in the negation of the self as separate from its experiences that we find freedom from hurt. This freedom is not an end state to be achieved but a realization of the inherent non-duality of existence.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a9dfc817-7e3d-4895-859a-7dd3c35ed9c4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Discontent as a Catalyst for Growth</strong></summary><p id="54e55d82-1a0e-4c11-9a12-6100a33d946c" class="">In the realm of personal growth and spiritual development, discontent often carries a negative connotation, perceived as a state to be avoided or overcome. However, a deeper exploration into the nature of discontent reveals its potential as a powerful catalyst for growth and transformation. This exploration challenges the traditional view of discontent, urging us to reconsider its role in our lives.</p><h3 id="2e0641b0-221d-4c01-821a-e28e1f88046a" class="">Understanding Discontent</h3><p id="83613452-a03b-46ec-94a3-9cf2bf765c83" class="">Discontent arises from a sense of dissatisfaction with our current state, whether it pertains to material conditions, relationships, or our inner spiritual journey. It is the feeling of wanting more, of yearning for change or improvement. Discontent can manifest as a subtle unease or a profound existential angst, driving us to question our circumstances and seek different or deeper meanings in life.</p><h3 id="48f297f0-72f8-4e98-b674-c40b9a41d228" class="">The Dual Nature of Discontent</h3><p id="52c34e34-5c6c-4452-8dae-36623779a5ec" class="">Discontent is inherently dualistic, embodying both negative and positive aspects. On one hand, it can lead to restlessness, frustration, and a sense of perpetual lack, trapping individuals in a cycle of constant seeking without fulfillment. On the other hand, when approached with awareness and openness, discontent can serve as a motivational force, pushing us to explore new possibilities, to grow, and to transcend our limitations.</p><h3 id="66d1ef81-6749-4238-896a-cadab67a93d3" class="">The Misunderstanding of Discontent</h3><p id="1a053664-ab20-42a8-9a21-27a96ca83be2" class="">The misunderstanding of discontent lies in the perception that it is an obstacle to happiness and fulfillment. This view encourages the suppression or avoidance of discontent through various distractions or the pursuit of superficial pleasures. However, this approach only addresses the symptoms of discontent, ignoring its underlying causes and the opportunities it presents for deeper introspection and self-discovery.</p><h3 id="3c6321c3-6da1-4a06-9233-6d945da19061" class="">Discontent as a Flame of Inquiry</h3><p id="a979c5fa-a930-48c6-bc2c-5984b8494482" class="">Rather than viewing discontent as a problem to be solved, it can be seen as a flame of inquiry, illuminating the aspects of our lives that require attention and transformation. Discontent prompts us to question our values, beliefs, and the very nature of our existence, leading us to a more authentic and meaningful engagement with life. It challenges us to break free from complacency and to embark on a journey of self-exploration and spiritual awakening.</p><h3 id="b61f1482-79a5-4f9d-a7c5-550072ebe98b" class="">The Role of Awareness in Navigating Discontent</h3><p id="cd8ec029-f491-44d2-9a4c-f50eb6560cb1" class="">Navigating the waters of discontent requires a heightened state of awareness. By observing our discontent without judgment or immediate reaction, we can understand its roots and what it reveals about our desires, fears, and unmet needs. This process of observation allows us to engage with our discontent constructively, using it as a guide for personal and spiritual growth rather than as a source of suffering.</p><h3 id="4f7354aa-0d2f-4ff6-8f01-95bc36572c9a" class="">Transcending Discontent through Creativity and Growth</h3><p id="c166c42f-3248-41d0-908e-79f00181402e" class="">The ultimate transcendence of discontent does not lie in finding permanent contentment or satisfaction in external achievements or acquisitions. Instead, it involves embracing the dynamic nature of life, where change is constant, and uncertainty is inevitable. By channeling our discontent into creative endeavors, compassionate actions, and the pursuit of wisdom, we transform the energy of discontent into a force for positive change in ourselves and the world around us.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="6bdd2971-c4d2-45fa-9959-0f89bbb9b5d4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>The Basics and Foundations of Manifesting</strong></summary><p id="45f19a16-7c66-4b67-b2cb-7a12bb271410" class="">Many people have a sincere desire to help raise the consciousness on the planet. I often hear from individuals who say, for example, that they want to manifest an innovative business that can change the world in some way or other. That is good—but if you want to manifest consciously, you have to start with the right foundation.</p><p id="6cf59189-7fc5-4464-83e4-6f2f09149f06" class="">The foundation for all conscious doing is conscious being. That’s the important realization when it comes to the question of manifestation. What does it mean to have a foundation in being? It means you are rooted in stillness, in the transcendent dimension—the formless, the eternal. Is it possible to reconcile the awareness of inner stillness and being and the outward pull toward action and doing? I would say that it is, and that is our challenge at this time.</p><p id="036f991c-7b33-4702-a022-02ebe2827b73" class="">So, before a person begins manifesting or creating something, that person needs to find his or her timeless and formless essence identity. That’s the foundation. If that isn’t there, forget about manifesting or creating. You’ll just create more trouble.</p><p id="1b6ba34b-f96e-415e-8442-81e205848435" class="">When you can stay connected with being while you do, then whatever you do is conscious doing, conscious creation. This is a more powerful, very different kind of doing. But the foundation comes first, and remains primary. (Ultimately, being needs to remain primary in your life whether or not you are engaged in a lot of doing.)</p><p id="c1648ec7-e898-4087-92e5-62d8d6b228dc" class="">It may well be that a new stage is arising on the planet—the stage where, through the human form, there’s a possibility for the universe to create consciously. It is exciting to consider that human beings can fully realize their creative power—which is as vast and unlimited as the universal creative power, because you and the universe are not separate. You are an aspect of the universe. You are the universe, expressing itself as this form.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="26841f09-2199-47fd-a2bc-e9f59962327e" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Aggression</summary><p id="96951f71-b428-40c4-a397-239869bbcc7f" class="">IT WAS AN OLD, vast Byzantine building which had become a mosque. It was immense. Inside they were chanting the Koran and one sat beside a beggar on a carpet under the huge dome. The chanting was magnificent, echoing in the great space. There was no difference here between the beggar and that well-dressed man, apparently well-to-do. There were no women here. The men had their heads bowed, muttering to themselves silently. Light came through the coloured glass and made patterns on the carpet. Outside were many beggars, so many people wanting things; and down there was the blue sea, dividing the East and the West.</p><p id="81fe2308-ff0f-4d41-b46a-0da557ec51f2" class="">It was a very ancient temple. They really couldn’t tell how old it was but they loved to exaggerate the antiquity of their temples. One came to it through dusty, dirty roads with palm trees and open gutters. They walked seven times around the sanctuary and prostrated themselves as they passed the door through which one saw the image. They were devotees, completely absorbed in their prayers; and here only the Brahmins were allowed. There were bats and the smell of incense. The image was covered with jewels and bright silk. Women stood there with hands raised and children were playing in the courtyard, shouting, laughing, running round the pillars. All the pillars were carved; there was a great sense of space and heavy dignity, and because it was so bright outside in the dazzling sun, here it was cool. Some sannyasis sat meditating, undisturbed by the passers-by. There was that peculiar quality of atmosphere that exists when many thousands through the centuries come to pray, worship and give offerings to the Gods. There was a tank of water and they were bathing in it. It was a sacred tank because it was within the walls of the temple. It was very quiet in the sanctuary but the rest of the place was used not only for worship, for children to play in, but also by the older generation as a meeting place where they sat and talked and chattered about their life. Young students chanted in Sanskrit and later that evening about a hundred priests gathered outside the sanctuary to chant, praising the glory of the Lord. The chanting shook the walls and was a marvellous sound. Outside there was the hard blue sky of the south and in the evening light the palm trees were beautiful.</p><p id="ea4c10e8-16d2-4d96-839a-c58e3c1a644b" class="">There was the vast piazza with a curving colonnade of pillars and the huge basilica with its tremendous dome. People were pouring into it, tourists from all over the world, looking with great wonder at the mass being performed; but there was very little atmosphere here– too many inquisitive people, hushed voices. It had become a show place. There was great beauty in the rituals, in the priests’ robes but it was all man-made–the image, the Latin and the structure of the ceremony. It was made by the hand and by the mind, cunningly put together to convince one of the greatness and the power of God.</p><p id="74ea4f16-be4a-4645-8e27-919499c49f92" class="">We had been walking through the English countryside among the open fields: there were pheasants, a clear blue sky and the light of the early evening. The slow quiet autumn was coming in. Leaves were turning yellow and red and dropping from the huge trees. Everything was waiting for winter, silent, apprehensive, withdrawn. How very different nature was in the springtime. Then everything was bursting with life–every blade of grass and the new leaf. Then there was the song of birds and murmuring of many leaves. But now though there was not a breath of air, though everything was still, it felt the approach of winter, rainy stormy days, snow and violent gales.</p><p id="5c9f1f36-41ae-4106-89bd-e3e22454d2cf" class="">Walking along the fields and climbing over a stile you came to a grove of many trees and several redwoods. As you entered it you were suddenly aware of its absolute silence. There wasn’t a leaf moving, it was as though a spell had been cast upon it. The grass was greener, brighter with the slanting sun upon it and you felt all of a sudden a great feeling of sacredness. You walked through it almost holding your breath, hesitating to step. There were great blooms of hydrangeas and rhododendrons which would flower in several months, but none of these things mattered, or rather they gave a benediction to this spot. You realized when you came out of the grove that your mind was completely empty without a single thought. There was only that and nothing else.</p><p id="926ab719-a98d-4b25-b671-ea25bc806816" class="">When one loses the deep intimate relationship with nature, then temples, mosques and churches become important.</p><p id="2a83695a-b084-4319-8773-c3a692e1ab68" class="">The teacher said, “How can one prevent, not only in the student but in ourselves, this competitive aggressive pursuit of one’s own demand? I have taught now for many years in various schools and colleges, not only here but abroad, and I find throughout my teaching career this aggressive competitiveness. There is a reaction to this now. Young people want to live together in communes, feeling the warmth and comfort of companionship which they call love. They feel this way of living is much more real, full of meaning. But they also become exclusive. They gather together by the thousands for music festivals and in this living together they share not only the music but the enjoyment of it all. They seem so utterly promiscuous and to me it all seems childish and rather superficial. They may deny competitive aggression but it is still there in their blood. It shows itself in many ways of which they may not be aware. I have seen this same attitude among students. They are not learning for the sake of learning but for success, because of their desire to achieve. Some realize all this and reject it and drift. It is all right when they are young, under twenty, but soon they are caught and their drifting ways become the new routine.</p><p id="0fd17d53-8ba9-481b-9f54-855cbd1f7789" class="">“All this seems superficial and passing, but deep down man is against man. It shows in this terrible competition both in the communist world and in the so-called democracies. It is there. I find it in myself like a flame burning, driving me. I want to be better than somebody, not only for prestige and comfort, but for the feeling of superiority, the feeling of being. This feeling exists in the students though they may have a mild gentle face. They all want to be somebody. It shows in the class and every teacher is comparing A with B and urging B to be like A. In the family and in the school this goes on.”</p><p id="9daeac9d-e3cd-4e21-802c-f9fca6126636" class="">When you compare B with A, openly or secretly, you are destroying B. B is not important at all, for you have in your mind the image of A who is clever, bright, and you have given him a certain value. The essence of all this competitiveness is comparison: comparing one picture with another, one book with another, a person with another–the hero, the example, the principle, the ideal. This comparison is measurement between what is and what should be. You give marks to the student and so force him to compete with himself; and the final misery of all this comparison is the examinations. All your heroes, religious and worldly, exist because of this spirit of comparison. Every parent, the whole social structure in the worlds of religion, art, science and business is the same. This measurement between yourself and another, between those who know and the ignorant, has existed and continues in our daily life. Why do you compare? What is the need of measurement? Is it an escape from yourself, from your own shallowness, emptiness and insufficiency? This attachment to measurement of what you have been and what you will be divides life and thereby all conflict begins.</p><p id="a4816a02-c971-4118-a377-c851e1abbc51" class="">“But surely, Sir, you must compare. You compare when you choose this or that house, this or that cloth. Choice is necessary.”</p><p id="2c413fe5-3343-4e7e-be0c-511b192abbf7" class="">We are not talking about such superficial choice. That is inevitable. But we are concerned with the psychological, the inward comparative spirit which brings about competitiveness with its aggression and ruthlessness. You are asking why, as a teacher and human being, you have this spirit, why you compete, why you compare. If you do not understand this in yourself, you will be encouraging competition, consciously or unconsciously, in the student. You will set up the image of the hero–political, economic or moral. The saint wants to break records as much as the man who plays cricket. Really there is not much difference between them, for both have this comparative evaluation of life. If you seriously ask yourself why you compare and whether it is possible to live a life without comparison, if you seriously enquire into this, not merely intellectually but actually, and go into yourself deeply putting away this competitive aggression, would you not find that there is a deep fear of being nothing? By putting on different masks, according to the culture and society you live in, you cover the fear of not being and not becoming: the becoming as something better than what is– something greater, nobler. When you observe what actually is, it is also the result of previous conditioning, of measurement. When you understand the real significance of measurement and comparison then there is freedom from what is.</p><p id="3332567d-dfbc-4c0b-862f-839de042dca1" class="">After a moment the teacher said, “If there is not the encouragement of comparison the student will not study. He needs to be encouraged, to be goaded, to be cajoled, and also he wants to know how he is doing. When he takes an examination he has the right to know how many of his answers were correct and how close his knowledge is to what was taught.”</p><p id="8b372580-69c5-4d67-a4aa-15720dbf14b0" class="">If I may point out, Sirs, he is like you. He is conditioned by society and the culture in which he lives. One has to learn about this competitive aggression which comes through comparison and measurement. This may bring about an accumulation of great knowledge, you may achieve a great many things, but it denies love and it denies also the understanding of oneself. Understanding oneself is of far greater importance than becoming somebody. The very words we use are comparative–better, greater, nobler.</p><p id="d9abd6e9-8ab7-4b80-a967-0292c89a6957" class="">“But, Sir, I must ask–how does either student or teacher evaluate his factual knowledge of a subject without some kind of examination?”</p><p id="f924414b-c8e6-443e-8c27-667ce287442c" class="">Doesn’t this imply that in everyday teaching and learning, through discussion, study, the teacher will become aware of how much factual knowledge the student has absorbed? This really means, doesn’t it, that the teacher has to keep a close watch on the student, observe his capacity, what is going on in his head. That means you must care for the student. “There is so much to convey to the student.”</p><p id="cb796b39-6062-4c39-8e18-aea45ff7d202" class="">What is it you want to convey to him? To live a non-competitive life? To explain to him the machinery of comparison and what it does? Tell him in words and convince him intellectually? You yourselves may see this intellectually or verbally understand it, but is it not possible to find a way of living in which all comparison ceases? You as teachers and human beings have to live that way. Only then can you convey it to the student and it will have truth behind it. But if you don’t live that way you are only playing with words and hypocrisy follows. To live without measurement and comparison inwardly is only possible when you yourself are learning the whole implication of it–the aggression, the brutality, the division and its envies. Freedom means a life without comparison. But inevitably you will ask what is the condition of a life without any high or low, without an example, without division. You want a description of it so that through description you may capture it. This is another form of comparison and competition. The description is never the described. You have to live it and then you will know what it means.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="5bd51cb0-e067-4f85-8eb2-d38817b490dd" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Violence and Anger</summary><p id="7fde9b4f-b93d-45da-a52d-d506c8930ae9" class=""><strong>FEAR, PLEASURE, SORROW, thought and violence are all interrelated.

Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.</strong></p><p id="4bb60d01-570d-4da3-a98f-d052f3a3e7a1" class=""><strong>Now there are two primary schools of thought with regard to violence, one which says, ‘Violence is innate in man’ and the other which says, ‘Violence is the result of the social and cultural heritage in which man lives.’ We are not concerned with which school we belong to – it is of no importance. What is important is the fact that we are violent, not the reason for it.</strong></p><p id="68c8a892-1cdb-417f-9e18-2d6dd46f83c2" class=""><strong>One of the most common expressions of violence is anger. When my wife or sister is attacked I say I am righteously angry; when my country is attacked, my ideas, my principles, my way of life, I am righteously angry. I am also angry when my habits are attacked or my petty little opinions. When you tread on my toes or insult me I get angry, or if you run away with my wife and I get jealous, that jealousy is called righteous because she is my property. And all this anger is morally justified. But to kill for my country is also justified. So when we are talking about anger, which is a part of violence, do we look at anger in terms of righteous and unrighteous anger according to our own inclinations and environmental drive, or do we see only anger? Is there righteous anger ever? Or is there only anger? There is no good influence or bad influence, only influence, but when you are influenced by something which doesn’t suit me I call it an evil influence.</strong></p><p id="1f08100d-e71d-4075-ac6b-c3efda8055f9" class=""><strong>The moment you protect your family, your country, a bit of coloured rag called a flag, a belief, an idea, a dogma, the thing that you demand or that you hold, that very protection indicates anger. So can you look at anger without any explanation or justification, without saying, ‘I must protect my goods’, or ‘I was right to be angry’, or ‘How stupid of me to be angry’? Can you look at anger as if it were something by itself? Can you look at it completely objectively, which means neither defending it nor condemning it? Can you?</strong></p><p id="3e830ea8-0732-45f1-87c1-72a21cf36c25" class=""><strong>Can I look at you if I am antagonistic to you or if I am thinking what a marvellous person you are? I can see you only when I look at you with a certain care in which neither of these things is involved.

Here I am, a violent human being, whether I am black, brown, white or purple. I am not concerned with whether I have inherited this violence or whether society has produced it in me; all I am concerned with is whether it is at all possible to be free from it. To be free from violence means everything to me. It is more important to me than sex, food, position, for this thing is corrupting me. It is destroying me and destroying the world, and I want to understand it, I want to be beyond it. I feel responsible for all this anger and violence in the world. I feel responsible – it isn’t just a lot of words – and I say to myself, ‘I can do something only if I am beyond anger myself, beyond violence, beyond nationality’. And this feeling I have that I must understand the violence in myself brings tremendous vitality and passion to find out.</strong></p><p id="c798a408-8107-4483-861c-9197cb5674c8" class=""><strong>But to be beyond violence I cannot suppress it, I cannot deny it, I cannot say, ‘Well, it is a part of me and that’s that’, or ‘I don’t want it’. I have to look at it, I have to study it, I must become very intimate with it and I cannot become intimate with it if I condemn it or justify it. We do condemn it, though; we do justify it. Therefore I am saying, stop for the time being condemning it or justifying it.</strong></p><p id="f12c2d4f-2478-4bf4-9e03-33be9cc77e19" class=""><strong>Now, if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop wars, how much vitality, how much of yourself, do you give to it? Isn’t it important to you that your children are killed, that your sons go into the army where they are bullied and butchered? Don’t you care? My God, if that doesn’t interest you, what does? Guarding your money? Having a good time? Taking drugs? Don’t you see that this violence in yourself is destroying your children?

I point out to you that you cannot look at anger nor at violence with eyes that condemn or justify and that if this violence is not a burning problem to you, you cannot put those two things away. So first you have to learn; you have to learn how to look at anger, how to look at your husband, your wife, your children; you have to listen to the politician, you have to learn why you are not objective, why you condemn or justify. You have to learn that you condemn and justify because it is part of the social structure you live in, your conditioning as a German or an Indian or a Negro or an American or whatever you happen to have been born, with all the dulling of the mind that this conditioning results in. To learn, to discover, something fundamental you must have the capacity to go deeply. If you have a blunt instrument, a dull instrument, you cannot go deeply. So what we are doing is sharpening the instrument, which is the mind – the mind which has been made dull by all this justifying and condemning. You can penetrate deeply only if your mind is as sharp as a needle and as strong as a diamond.</strong></p><p id="2fecb5ef-363d-4a34-a703-73976db83834" class=""><strong>It is no good just sitting back and asking, ‘How am I to get such a mind?’ You have to want it as you want your next meal, and to have it you must see that what makes your mind dull and stupid is this sense of invulnerability which has built walls round itself and which is part of this condemnation and justification. If the mind can be rid of that, then you can look, study, penetrate, and perhaps come to a state that is totally aware of the whole problem.</strong></p><p id="033081b8-0fc2-4768-ad7b-009f366bf1b6" class=""><strong>So let us come back to the central issue – is it possible to eradicate violence in ourselves?

We might be able to modify ourselves slightly, live a little more quietly with a little more affection, but in itself it will not give total perception. But I must know how to analyse which means that in the process of analysis my mind becomes extraordinarily sharp, and it is that quality of sharpness, of attention, of seriousness, which will give total perception. One hasn’t the eyes to see the whole thing at a glance; this clarity of the eye is possible only if one can see the details, then jump.</strong></p><p id="105980c7-f2f5-4294-8248-2404c5faf74b" class=""><strong>Some of us, in order to rid ourselves of violence, have used a concept, an ideal, called non-violence, and we think by having an ideal of the opposite to violence, non-violence, we can get rid of the fact, the actual – but we cannot.

The journey of job hunting, facing rejection, and managing financial constraints can lead to significant stress and turmoil. During these trying times, it is crucial to maintain a connection with your inner self and spiritual awareness while addressing the practical aspects of unemployment.</p><p id="3415ad30-305e-4aa3-b8f9-9c9505b92cb1" class="">One can gain valuable insights from a perspective that acknowledges the transformative potential of challenges in life. Challenges, including unemployment, can either serve as catalysts for personal growth and self-discovery or plunge individuals into a state of reactivity and suffering.</p><p id="f5cf4329-0e95-4c1c-872e-d8ee5680524d" class="">Personal experiences of living with limited resources can provide a relatable context for many. For instance, adjusting to practical limitations, such as opting for cheaper groceries, may seem like a small sacrifice. However, the true suffering often arises from negative thoughts surrounding one&#x27;s self-worth. Common inner dialogues include feelings of inadequacy, concerns about aging, or regrets about past decisions.</p><p id="9f77e5c2-9174-400b-a206-45d28a2ea4cc" class="">It is important to recognize that deriving one&#x27;s self-worth solely from external factors, such as job titles or societal recognition, can be a precarious foundation. Instead, this challenging period can serve as an opportunity to explore a deeper understanding of self-worth that transcends societal expectations and conventional thinking. By disentangling from the ego-driven self-image constructed from thoughts and external validation, individuals can uncover a more profound sense of self-worth rooted in their authentic essence.</p><p id="428bf41e-e75b-46d5-bbdc-4d5dbbf007b5" class="">During unemployment, suffering can emerge as a catalyst for awakening. When facing a diminished self-image due to job loss, individuals can choose to move beyond the confines of their thoughts and embrace the present moment&#x27;s sense of aliveness. This shift in consciousness allows them to realize that their true identity extends far beyond any mental constructs.</p><p id="46c3c471-0da2-47b3-81d5-8c2be8220afa" class="">It is essential to understand that thoughts concerning self-worth are ultimately illusory, whether positive or negative. By shifting the focus from external circumstances to inner fulfillment, individuals can cultivate a newfound sense of contentment. This inner contentment can, in turn, positively impact their job search and performance when they eventually secure employment.</p><p id="a2d7ef7f-299f-4ece-8461-4241edb258ae" class="">In conclusion, maintaining a connection with one&#x27;s inner self and spirituality during unemployment is a powerful way to navigate this challenging phase. By redirecting the focus from external validation to inner fulfillment, individuals can transform unemployment into an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery. This approach can empower them to confront the challenges of unemployment with resilience and pave the way for a more meaningful and fulfilling future.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="4018aedb-dc24-4fd0-a975-d9820a1fee47" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Peace after a Loss</summary><p id="d79e3669-63cf-4af6-92ee-955460c34c8c" class="">The natural way of being after death of a loved one is suffering at first, then there is a deepening. In that deepening, you go to a place where there is no death. And the fact that you felt that means you went deep enough, to the place where there is no death.</p><p id="d513ecd9-4e51-4b6e-89cf-8c5b38ba5cd6" class="">Conditioned as your mind is by society, the contemporary world that you live in, which knows nothing about that dimension – your mind then tells you that there is something wrong with this. Your mind says “I should not be feeling peace, that is not what one feels in a situation like this”. But that’s a conditioned thought by the culture that you live in. So instead we can recognize when this happens, when that thought comes – recognize it as a conditioned thought that is not true. It doesn’t mean that the waves of sadness don’t come back from time to time. But in between the waves of sadness, you sense there is peace. As you sense that peace, you sense the essence of your children as well – the timeless essence. So death is a very sacred thing – not just a dreadful thing. When you react to the loss of form, that’s dreadful.</p><p id="b0e9464e-9d29-4667-b0d5-b86db3fca01e" class="">When you go deep enough to the formless, the dreadful is no longer dreadful, it’s sacred. Then you will experience the two levels, when somebody dies who is close to you. Yes it’s dreadful on the level of form. It’s sacred on the deeper level. Death can enable you to find that dimension in yourself. You’re helping countless other humans if you find that dimension in yourself – the sacred dimension of life. Death can help you find the sacred dimension of life – where life is indestructible.</p><p id="77ca3338-1c5c-4e1b-930a-c60351a50075" class="">Surrender can open that door for you. Complete acceptance of it. So honor that sacred dimension and realize that what your mind is saying, that it isn’t right, is just a form of conditioning – it isn’t the truth. It is supremely right.</p><p id="d2aabdb8-8219-4298-a992-7fe98d32a216" class="">This is always the window into the formless. As you accept it, surrender. Because the form is gone, your mind becomes still when you surrender to death. It’s not through explanations that you accept death. You can have explanations, mental explanations that say, well, he or she will move on or reincarnate, or go to some place of rest. That can be comforting, but you can go to a deeper place than that, where you don’t need explanations – a state of immediate realization of the sacredness of death, because what opens up when the form dissolves is life beyond form. That is the only thing that is sacred. That is the sacred dimension.</p><p id="18bb16c3-0e74-4183-8a88-98c835dcef76" class="">You can get tiny glimpses of that when you lose something, and you completely accept that it’s gone.

Fear of what? There are various types of fear, and we need not analyse every type. But we can see that fear comes into being when our comprehension of relationship is not complete. Relationship is not only between people but between ourselves and nature, between ourselves and property, between ourselves and ideas; as long as that relationship is not fully understood, there must be fear. Life is relationship. To be is to be related and without relationship there is no life. Nothing can exist in isolation; so long as the mind is seeking isolation, there must be fear. Fear is not an abstraction; it exists only in relation to something.</p><p id="bcb2a88d-7e7f-4056-b4af-4404c179b1e7" class="">The question is, how to be rid of fear? First of all, anything that is overcome has to be conquered again and again. No problem can be finally overcome, conquered; it can be understood but not conquered. They are two completely different processes and the conquering process leads to further confusion, further fear. To resist, to dominate, to do battle with a problem or to build a defence against it is only to create further conflict, whereas if we can understand fear, go into it fully step by step, explore the whole content of it, then fear will never return in any form.</p><p id="4fdef155-1f95-4d4a-90af-7daa76638cda" class="">As I said, fear is not an abstraction; it exists only in relationship. What do we mean by fear? Ultimately we are afraid of not being, of not becoming. Now, when there is fear of not being, of not advancing, or fear of the unknown, of death, can that fear be overcome by determination, by a conclusion, by any choice? Obviously not. Mere suppression, sublimation, or substitution, creates further resistance, does it not? Therefore fear can never be overcome through any form of discipline, through any form of resistance. That fact must be clearly seen, felt and experienced: fear cannot be overcome through any form of defence or resistance nor can there be freedom from fear through the search for an answer or through mere intellectual or verbal explanation.</p><p id="be977ad8-dabf-426a-a429-df51f1bc0436" class="">Now, what are we afraid of? Are we afraid of a fact or of an idea about the fact? Are we afraid of the thing as it is, or are we afraid of what we think it is? Take death, for example. Are we afraid of the fact of death or of the idea of death? The fact is one thing, and the idea about the fact is another. Am I afraid of the word `death’ or of the fact itself? Because I am afraid of the word, of the idea, I never understand the fact, I never look at the fact, I am never in direct relation with the fact. It is only when I am in complete communion with the fact that there is no fear. If I am not in communion with the fact, then there is fear, and there is no communion with the fact so long as I have an idea, an opinion, a theory about the fact, so I have to be very clear whether I am afraid of the word, the idea or of the fact. If I am face to face with the fact, there is nothing to understand about it: the fact is there, and I can deal with it. If I am afraid of the word, then I must understand the word, go into the whole process of what the word, the term, implies.</p><p id="514c8f43-0294-4f2b-9053-170b6a0765db" class="">For example, one is afraid of loneliness, afraid of the ache, the pain of loneliness. Surely that fear exists because one has never really looked at loneliness, one has never been in complete communion with it. The moment one is completely open to the fact of loneliness one can understand what it is, but one has an idea, an opinion about it, based on previous knowledge; it is this idea, opinion, this previous knowledge about the fact, that creates fear. Fear is obviously the outcome of naming, of terming, of projecting a symbol to represent the fact; that is fear is not independent of the word, of the term.</p><p id="e6bc37b7-10be-4497-b587-bb2acf320f54" class="">I have a reaction, say, to loneliness; that is I say I am afraid of being nothing. Am I afraid of the fact itself or is that fear awakened because I have previous knowledge of the fact, knowledge being the word, the symbol, the image? How can there be fear of a fact? When I am face to face with a fact, in direct communion with it, I can look at it, observe it; therefore there is no fear of the fact. What causes fear is my apprehension about the fact, what the fact might be or do.</p><p id="e241e4e7-a5ee-4d18-a062-51eb8f017ba7" class="">It is my opinion, my idea, my experience, my knowledge about the fact that creates fear. So long as there is verbalization of the fact, giving the fact a name and therefore identifying or condemning it, so long as thought is judging the fact as an observer, there must be fear. Thought is the product of the past, it can only exist through verbalization, through symbols, through images; so long as thought is regarding or translating the fact, there must be fear.</p><p id="728b3e41-6ef2-453a-b9b5-0cedb235e5f3" class="">Thus it is the mind that creates fear, the mind being the process of thinking. Thinking is verbalization. You cannot think without words, without symbols, images; these images, which are the prejudices, the previous knowledge, the apprehensions of the mind, are projected upon the fact, and out of that there arises fear. There is freedom from fear only when the mind is capable of looking at the fact without translating it, without giving it a name, a label. This is quite difficult, because the feelings, the reactions, the anxieties that we have, are promptly identified by the mind and given a word. The feeling of jealousy is identified by that word. Is it possible not to identify a feeling, to look at that feeling without naming it? It is the naming of the feeling that gives it continuity, that gives it strength. The moment you give a name to that which you call fear, you strengthen it; but if you can look at that feeling without terming it, you will see that it withers away. Therefore if one would be completely free of fear it is essential to understand this whole process of terming, of projecting symbols, images, giving names to facts. There can be freedom from fear only when there is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, which is the ending of fear.</p><p id="fd41a4fa-7142-4bae-9c5f-30bca70c5476" class="">The reason why you don&#x27;t put your hand in the fire is not because of fear, it&#x27;s because you know that you&#x27;ll get burned. You don&#x27;t need fear to avoid unnecessary danger -- just a minimum of intelligence and common sense. For such practical matters, it is useful to apply the lessons learned in the past. Now if someone <em>threatened </em>you with fire or with physical violence, you might experience something like fear. This is an instinctive shrinking back from danger, but not the psychological condition of fear that we are talking about here. The psychological condition of fear is divorced from any concrete and true immediate danger. It comes in many forms: unease, worry, anxiety, nervousness,</p><p id="de102e8d-4d7c-4e4c-b3d3-6f3c4db2755a" class="">tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological fear is always of something that <em>might </em>happen, not of something that is happening now. <em>You </em>are in the here and now, while your mind is in the future. This creates an anxiety gap. And if you are identified with your mind and have lost touch with the power and simplicity of the Now, that anxiety gap will be your constant companion. You can always cope with the present moment, but you cannot cope with something that is only a mind projection -- you cannot cope with the future.</p><p id="e209d481-bf3f-4bf1-be9a-a4abfa9c2460" class="">Moreover, as long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life, as I pointed out earlier. Because of its phantom nature, and despite elaborate defense mechanisms, the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itself as constantly under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego is outwardly very confident. Now remember that an emotion is the body&#x27;s reaction to your mind. What message is the body receiving continuously from the ego, the false, mind-made self?. Danger, I am under threat. And what is the emotion generated by this continuous message? Fear, of course.</p><p id="812e83d0-591b-45f6-a22a-75b8939e7ed8" class="">Fear seems to have many causes, Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego&#x27;s fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego, death is always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, fear of death affects every aspect of your life. For example, even such a seemingly trivial and &quot;normal&quot; thing as the compulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other person wrong -- defending the mental position with which you have identified -- is due to the fear of death. If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your mind-based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation. So you as the ego cannot afford to be wrong. To be wrong is to die. Wars have been fought over this, and countless relationships have broken down.</p><p id="a491164a-dc34-48d3-aea8-9e840affd602" class="">Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you are right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self at all, so the forcefully compulsive and deeply unconscious need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longer be there. You can state clearly and firmly how you feel or what you think, but there will be no aggressiveness <em>or defensiveness </em>about it. Your sense of self is then derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind. Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself. What are you defending? An illusory identity, an image in your mind, a fictitious entity. By making this pattern conscious, by witnessing it, you disidentify from it. In the light of your consciousness, the unconscious pattern will then quickly dissolve. This is the end of all arguments and power games, which are so corrosive to relationships. Power over others is weakness disguised as strength. True power is within, and it is available to you now.</p><p id="8e702f94-06b4-4835-b674-225438be0519" class="">So anyone who is identified with their mind and, therefore, disconnected from their true power, their deeper self rooted in Being, will have fear as their constant companion. The number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet extremely small, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or know lives in a state of fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluctuates between anxiety and dread at one end of the scale and a vague unease and distant sense of threat at the other. Most people become conscious of it only when it takes on one of its more acute forms.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="86d8935e-7e57-4bd9-9388-9ac2cb1881d4" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Low Self-Esteem and Anxiety</summary><p id="41eb94ae-2d82-4926-9afc-e100d6a3554f" class=""> Not everybody who’s anxious knows that they are anxious.

If you ask them, “Are you anxious?” they reply, “No, I’m not anxious.”</p><p id="4fce2043-ec2c-4a18-8997-68ddab2956c0" class="">The question, “I have no idea what I want from my life,” looks like the beginning of the place of not knowing, which is good. “I have low self-esteem,” indicates that you have the awareness that you have low self-esteem. “I get defensive easily,” again, this indicates that you know that you get defensive; the question is… in the moment of getting defensive do you know that you’re getting defensive, or do you just know it afterwards? “I’m rarely content or grateful,” is a good self-observation, too. “My thinking is so negative,” is another good piece of self-knowledge. You can ask, in this moment, what other thoughts are going through my head?</p><p id="add113f1-5c13-4d26-9e60-3d99d5120652" class="">If you apply this awareness to the present moment when these things arise – defensiveness, low self-esteem and anxiety — you’ll see that certain repetitive thoughts in the mind are the voice in the head that tells you – this is low self-esteem. There might be certain emotions that go with the thoughts, but the basis for low self-esteem is the thoughts that you tell yourself about your low self-worth. The questioner knows that she has low self-esteem, and if she can recognize the thoughts in the moment of low self-esteem arising, she may realize the repetitive, conditioned thoughts are not necessarily true. Perhaps, the low self-esteem started in childhood – it often happens to people whose parents are very critical or tell them they are never good enough. It might have started there; it’s a conditioned way of thinking.</p><p id="a83e5160-2814-4b3b-b9dc-fbca9b37d873" class="">The awareness that’s already present in the questioner needs to be there in the moment when these thoughts arise — to recognize them as thoughts — and then, you are no longer completely trapped in what these thoughts are saying. In other words, your sense of being is not in the thought anymore; it is in the awareness of the thought. To use an analogy, the vastness of the sky is your awareness and the clouds are your thoughts.</p><p id="d3b7ba4c-8d1e-4936-bbf4-1cd263986879" class="">Remain the sky (the awareness) and allow the clouds (the thoughts) to come and go. You are the awareness behind the thoughts. This applies to any kind of negative thinking – it arises, you recognize it as automatic– it’s a thought. You are the awareness that knows this (low-self esteem) is a negative thought pattern. This way you are no longer feeding the conditioned thinking, so you are taking your identity out of thinking and no longer renewing old patterns.</p><p id="0ad643d7-7f63-4db1-b1c6-d148fcd88298" class="">If your awareness can grow, which means deepen, because it’s already there to some extent – then those conditioned patterns will diminish and get transmuted.</p><p id="013d0eda-501d-403b-81e2-de59560e2409" class="">Another point mentioned in the question: “I get defensive easily,” defensiveness happens very quickly in human interactions; it’s an automatic pattern. You may only recognize it afterwards, and say, “That was defensiveness again.” These are all ways the ego tried to protect itself– the ego being the mind-made self. Defensiveness will come up with any lie just to keep its ego identity intact.</p><p id="53e978f1-fa9f-4c46-bdb3-61a6c94f3888" class=""><em>A Course in Miracles</em> has a lovely saying, “Whenever you become defensive about anything, know that you have identified with an illusion.” That’s interesting. For example, you say that the distance from here to the moon is 350,000 kilometers or so – and the light takes just over one second to travel from the moon to the Earth. Then somebody else says, “No, that’s completely untrue; it actually takes one minute.” This is just a difference of opinion, but you know that the other person is wrong. If you say, “No, that’s not right,” is that defensiveness? It depends on how you say it. The question is…are you identified with your mind, which has a position that happens to be true, but are you identified with that mental position? Do you derive your sense of self from thought? If you’re identified with the thought, you will get angry and defensive with the other person who is completely wrong and you might say things like, “You always doubt me.” That’s the ego trying to protect itself.</p><p id="e691b0d3-a4b4-4c66-9ae7-f7fa6b6b6545" class="">The <em>A Course in Miracles</em> saying applies because you have identified yourself with an illusion. The illusion is not that it takes one second for light to travel from the moon to the Earth; the illusion is that you identified with the thought — a mind pattern — so you are strengthening an illusory identity by strengthening your mental position– that’s unconsciousness. This shows how a difference of opinion can degenerate into a huge conflict because the ego becomes defensive. Alertness is required on your part, so that you know when the ego arises.</p><p id="16a7bf5d-bb68-4b47-b63e-09d2c906ff18" class="">The key is your awareness. When awareness deepens all those patterns you mentioned will weaken. There’s already a considerable amount of awareness in this questioner. The awareness isn’t the person, but it’s deeper than the person. You apply the awareness to the present moment when things arise, but not in some abstract way, for example, “Will I ever become a person who is not negative? I can’t get rid of my patterns,” that doesn’t matter; this moment is what matters. So just apply your awareness to this moment; you can’t change things into mental constructs – “How can I change, I don’t want to be that kind of person anymore?” Forget it! This moment is where you apply Presence. I sometimes say, “The sword of Presence that cuts through time.”</p></details></li></ul><ul id="eed75e68-db3b-4d94-ba81-32c6030a3b6c" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Jealousy and Comparison</summary><p id="3fcf5ea4-9701-469c-be41-6d0fcf629452" class="">Jealousy is the art of constant comparison. We&#x27;ve been ingrained with this habit, conditioned to measure ourselves against others—always comparing. Someone else possesses a grander home, a more alluring physique, greater wealth, or a more captivating charisma. The act of comparison, a product of our conditioning, invariably leads to the breeding of jealousy. It&#x27;s the natural byproduct of this ceaseless comparison. Yet, should we cease comparing, jealousy would dissipate. In its place, there would be the simple recognition that you are you, and nobody else, and there&#x27;s no need for such comparisons.</p><p id="cca593e5-b6e8-4f29-b470-c414edc11102" class="">Imagine if you started comparing yourself to trees. You might feel jealous, wondering why you&#x27;re not as lush and green. You might even lament the absence of blossoms on your branches. Similarly, comparing with birds, rivers, or mountains could set off a cascade of jealousy. But we tend to reserve our comparisons for fellow human beings, a byproduct of our conditioning. We don&#x27;t engage in jealousy-inducing comparisons with peacocks or parrots. Otherwise, our jealousy might intensify to a point where life becomes unbearable.</p><p id="5213aeee-e86c-40e0-b52a-891332b3d9f8" class="">Comparison, at its core, is a fool&#x27;s errand because each person is unique and incomparable. Once this profound understanding takes root within you, jealousy naturally fades away. Each of us is a one-of-a-kind creation, unparalleled in our own way. There&#x27;s no need to emulate someone else. God crafts only originals; there&#x27;s no place for carbon copies.</p><p id="35c6df4e-6df1-4c80-b9da-93c9511b8512" class="">Here&#x27;s a story to illustrate this point: A flock of chickens stood in the yard when a football unexpectedly landed in their midst. The rooster, taking a closer look, remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m not complaining, ladies, but look at the work they&#x27;re churning out next door.&quot;</p><p id="dde14b8c-2073-4e61-a50c-329de639e791" class="">Across the fence, great things may seem to be happening: the grass appears greener, the roses more vibrant, and everyone appears joyous—except you. You&#x27;re continually comparing, and so is everyone else. They might believe your lawn is greener, or that you have a more captivating partner. You, in turn, might envy their circumstances. This cycle of comparison and jealousy perpetuates misery, meanness, and a bitter taste in life. When everyone is unhappy or failing, it oddly feels comforting. When everyone is joyful and successful, it tastes acrid.</p><p id="7c434e27-a484-4890-8b84-ce83f2734fbe" class="">But why do we even allow the idea of comparing ourselves to others to enter our minds? Let me remind you once more: it&#x27;s because we haven&#x27;t allowed our inner essence to flourish. We&#x27;ve stifled our own bliss, preventing it from flourishing. Consequently, we feel empty inside and resort to examining everyone&#x27;s exterior since that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s visible. You understand your own interiority, while others only perceive your exterior, which people often embellish. Exteriors are deceptive façades.</p><p id="87cdcec9-092e-40c0-97ee-fd64d28b3f34" class="">Here&#x27;s an ancient Sufi story to drive this point home: A man was burdened by his suffering and prayed daily to God, wondering why he alone suffered while everyone else seemed content. One day, in utter desperation, he prayed, &quot;I&#x27;m ready to accept anyone else&#x27;s suffering; just take mine away.&quot;</p><p id="b3041ae4-4f28-43b1-80c9-de04aa099bfc" class="">That night, he had a revealing dream. In the dream, God appeared in the sky and instructed everyone to gather their sufferings in bags and bring them to the temple. Eagerly, people filled their bags with their sufferings and rushed to the temple, thinking their prayers had been answered. This man, too, hurried to the temple.</p><p id="ef7deaaf-de67-40e7-9bdf-859aa589863b" class="">God said, &quot;Place your bags against the walls.&quot; After everyone complied, God announced, &quot;Now, you may choose any bag.&quot;</p><p id="f8512937-24b6-4904-bebe-d9552426bec8" class="">To everyone&#x27;s surprise, each person rushed toward their own bag. They were delighted to take back their own sufferings, for their bags were as big or even larger than others&#x27;. Moreover, they had grown accustomed to their own suffering. Choosing someone else&#x27;s suffering seemed risky. They knew their own misery, which had become familiar and bearable over the years. They departed from the temple, bags intact, but now, they were happy and content. Nothing had changed, yet they were all smiling and joyful that they could reclaim their own bag.</p><p id="16d9af69-e3ff-4341-9557-37bccecca2b4" class="">Jealousy perpetuates constant suffering and turns us into mean-spirited individuals. It compels us to become fake, to pretend to possess things we don&#x27;t, and to imitate others. We resort to imitation and competition out of jealousy—what other options do we have?</p><p id="86971dd5-2263-466e-b025-697495e4d15d" class="">If someone has something we lack, and it&#x27;s beyond our natural reach, we often settle for cheap substitutes. Our bags become filled with artificial, phony, and counterfeit possessions. Why not embrace authenticity and spontaneity? Jealousy chains us to an ongoing cycle of suffering. Let go of comparisons, and jealousy will vanish, along with meanness and phoniness. To do this, nurture your inner treasures. Grow into a more authentic individual, love and respect yourself as the unique creation you are, and the gates of heaven will swing open. They were always there, waiting for you to notice.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="27f15523-c923-4b82-8298-71e18be4a0b3" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Negativity</summary><p id="b3775410-2d31-4090-9d58-db7bb9c787ce" class="">All inner resistance is experienced as negativity in one form or another. All negativity <em>is </em>resistance. In this context, the two words are almost synonymous. Negativity ranges from irritation or impatience to fierce anger, from a depressed mood or sullen resentment to suicidal despair. Sometimes the resistance triggers the emotional pain- body, in which case even a minor situation may produce intense negativity, such as anger, depression, or deep grief.</p><p id="fb6408c9-a560-486e-bcb4-54c14aa512ba" class="">The ego believes that through negativity it can manipulate reality and get what it wants. It believes that through it, it can attract a desirable condition or dissolve an undesirable one. <em>A Course in Miracles </em>rightly points out that, whenever you are unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness &quot;buys&quot; you what you want. If &quot;you&quot; -- the mind -- did not believe that unhappiness works, why would you create it? The fact is, of course, that negativity does not work. Instead of attracting a desirable condition, it stops it from arising. Instead of dissolving an undesirable one, it keeps it in place. Its only &quot;useful&quot; function is that it strengthens the ego, and that is why the ego loves it.</p><p id="9ac1d135-50e6-46a0-ad1b-704e75a6d988" class="">Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, you do not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as a depressed, angry, or hard-done-by person. You will then ignore, deny or sabotage the positive in your life. This is a common phenomenon. It is also insane.</p><p id="a2d712eb-a7a2-4662-a253-1daf3827dfc9" class="">Negativity is totally unnatural. It is a psychic pollutant, and there is a deep link between the poisoning and destruction of nature and the vast negativity that has accumulated in the collective human psyche. No other life form on the planet knows negativity, only humans, just as no other life form violates and poisons the Earth that sustains it. Have you ever seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you come across a depressed dolphin, a frog that has a problem with self-esteem, a cat that cannot relax, or a bird that carries hatred and resentment? The only animals that may occasionally experience something akin to negativity or show signs of neurotic behavior are those that live in dose contact with humans and so link into the human mind and its insanity.</p><p id="ab8b398c-a42d-4c85-8e85-ed3762b89536" class="">Watch any plant or animal and let it teach you acceptance of what <em>is, </em>surrender to the Now. Let it teach you Being. Let it teach you integrity -- which means to be one, to be yourself, to be real. Let it teach you how to live and how to die, and how <em>not </em>to make living and dying into a problem.</p><p id="63086598-e48b-4c65-ba0e-08053b220bff" class="">I have lived with several Zen masters -- all of them cats. Even ducks have taught me important spiritual lessons, lust watching them is a meditation. How peacefully they float along, at ease with themselves, totally present in the Now, dignified and perfect as only a mindless creature can be. Occasionally, however, two ducks will get into a fight -- sometimes for no apparent reason, or because one duck has strayed into another&#x27;s private space. The fight usually lasts only for a few seconds, and then the ducks separate, swim off in opposite directions, and vigorously flap their wings a few times. They then continue to swim on peacefully as if the fight had never happened. When I observed that for the first time, I suddenly realized that by flapping their wings they were releasing surplus energy, thus preventing it from becoming trapped in their body and turning into negativity. This is natural wisdom, and it is easy for them because they do not have a mind that keeps the past alive unnecessarily and then builds an identity around it.</p><p id="09208a98-8bdd-4ede-bdb0-98aee37af6ea" class=""><em>Couldn&#x27;t a negative emotion also contain an important message ? </em>For <em>example, if I often feel depressed, it may be a signal that there is something wrong with my life, and it may force me to look at my life situation and make some changes. So I need to listen to what the emotion is telling me and not just dismiss it as negative.</em></p><p id="1120bbab-5dc7-423a-83ad-00157979aee9" class="">Yes, recurring negative emotions do sometimes contain a message, as do illnesses. But any changes that you make, whether they have to do with your work, your relationships, or your surroundings, are ultimately only cosmetic unless they arise out of a change in your level of consciousness. And as far as that is concerned, it can only mean one thing: becoming more present. When you have reached a certain degree of presence, you don&#x27;t need negativity anymore to tell you what is needed in your life situation. But as long as negativity <em>is </em>there, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that reminds you to be more present.</p><p id="c577b34e-e58d-47f7-afa5-40ca8f857a13" class=""><em>How do we stop negativity from arising, and how do we get rid of it once it is there?</em></p><p id="8fa8ee57-d09b-45b2-b556-1ccd636c6372" class="">As I said, you stop it from arising by being fully present. But don&#x27;t become discouraged. There are as yet few people on the planet who can sustain a state of continuous presence, although some are getting close to it. Soon, I believe, there will be many more. Whenever you notice that some form of negativity has arisen within you, look on it not as a failure, but as a helpful signal that is telling you: &quot;Wake up. Get out of your mind. Be present.&quot;</p><p id="110b0ac2-56ed-4204-957e-e71310f79745" class="">There is a novel by Aldous Huxley called <em>Island, </em>written in his later years when he became very interested in spiritual teachings. It tells the story of a man shipwrecked on a remote island cut off from the rest of the world. This island contains a unique civilization. The unusual thing about it is that its inhabitants, unlike those of the rest of the world, are actually sane. The first thing that the man notices are the colorful parrots perched in the trees, and they seem to be constantly croaking the words &quot;Attention. Here and Now. Attention. Here and Now.&quot; We later learn that the islanders taught them these words in order to be reminded continuously to stay present.</p><p id="06809e05-348b-402f-b352-8c94faa2106e" class="">So whenever you feel negativity arising within you, whether caused by an external factor, a thought, or even nothing in particular that you are aware of, look on it as a voice saying &quot;Attention. Here and Now. Wake <em>up.&quot; </em>Even the slightest irritation is significant and needs to be acknowledged and looked at; otherwise, there will be a cumulative build-up of unobserved reactions. As I said before, you may be able to just drop it once you realize that you don&#x27;t want to have this energy field inside you and that it serves no purpose. But then make sure that you drop it completely. If you cannot drop it, just accept that it is there and take your attention into the feeling, as I pointed out earlier.</p><p id="b7f66842-47f6-4df1-9f74-085661245d20" class="">As an alternative to dropping a negative reaction, you can make it disappear by imagining yourself becoming transparent to the external cause of the reaction. I recommend that you practice it with little, even trivial, things first. Let&#x27;s say that you are sitting quietly at home. Suddenly, there is the penetrating sound of a car alarm from across the street. Irritation arises. What is the purpose of the irritation? None whatsoever. Why did you create it? You didn&#x27;t. The mind did. It was totally automatic, totally unconscious. Why did the mind create it? Because it holds the unconscious belief that its resistance, which you experience as negativity or unhappiness in some form, will somehow dissolve the undesirable condition. This, of course, is a delusion. The resistance that it creates, the irritation or anger in this case, is far more disturbing than the original cause that it is attempting to dissolve.</p><p id="435f2842-a408-4bb1-adb0-99a92e5f41db" class="">All this can be transformed into spiritual practice. Feel yourself becoming transparent, as it were, without the solidity of a material body. Now allow the noise, or whatever causes a negative reaction, to pass right through you. It is no longer hitting a solid &quot;wall&quot; inside you. As I said, practice with little things first. The car alarm, the dog barking, the children screaming, the traffic jam. Instead of having a wall of resistance inside you that gets constantly and painfully hit by things that &quot;should not be happening,&quot; let everything pass through you.</p><p id="c42b6f9f-95be-422e-93e0-42876f55ddcf" class="">Somebody says something to you that is rude or designed to hurt. Instead of going into unconscious reaction and negativity, such as attack, defense, or withdrawal, you let it pass right through you. Offer no resistance. It is as if there is nobody there to get hurt anymore. <em>That </em>is forgiveness. In this way, you become invulnerable. You can still tell that person that his or her behavior is unacceptable, if that is what you choose to do. But that person no longer has the power to control your inner state. You are then in your power -- not in someone else&#x27;s, nor are you run by your mind. Whether it is a car alarm, a rude person, a flood, an earthquake, or the loss of all your possessions, the resistance mechanism is the same.</p><p id="a3ce5c69-1e6d-46c8-ae19-e52259e2e82b" class=""><em>I have been practicing meditation, I have been to workshops, I have read many books on spirituality, I try to be in a state of nonresistance -- but if you ask me whether I have found true and lasting inner peace, my honest answer would have to be &quot;no.&quot; Why haven&#x27;t I found it? What else can I do?</em></p><p id="4fd97fb4-ab1e-4ce0-9162-8daa566da31b" class="">You are still seeking outside, and you cannot get out of the seeking mode. Maybe the next workshop will have the answer, maybe that new technique. To you I would say: Don&#x27;t look for peace. Don&#x27;t look for any other state than the one you are in now; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely accept your non-peace, your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender.</p><p id="8e13e9e9-f08a-4dc8-aac2-ef0c984f05d1" class="">You may have heard the phrase <em>&quot;turn </em>the other cheek,&quot; which a great teacher of enlightenment used 2000 years ago. He was attempting to convey symbolically the secret of nonresistance and nonreaction. In this statement, as in all his others, he was concerned only with your inner reality, not with the outer conduct of your life.</p><p id="33463b5d-eed9-4b88-bcd1-d61cc89fcd08" class="">Do you know the story of Banzan? Before he became a great Zen master, he spent many years in the pursuit of enlightenment, but it eluded him. Then one day, as he was walking in the marketplace, he overheard a conversation between a butcher and his customer. &quot;Give me the best piece of meat you have,&quot; said the customer. And the butcher replied, &quot;Every piece of meat I have is the best. There is no piece of meat here that is not the best.&quot; Upon hearing this, Banzan became enlightened.</p><p id="824221e4-1ce6-4918-8b29-826cc440272f" class="">I can see you are waiting for some explanation. When you accept what is, every piece of meat -- every moment -- is the best.

There have been crises of varying types at different periods throughout history, social, national, political. Crises come and go; economic recessions, depressions, come, get modified, and continue in a different form. We know that; we are familiar with that process. Surely the present crisis is different, is it not? It is different first because we are dealing not with money nor with tangible things but with ideas. The crisis is exceptional because it is in the field of ideation. We are quarrelling with ideas, we are justifying murder; everywhere in the world we are justifying murder as a means to a righteous end, which in itself is unprecedented.</p><p id="1b5b9e41-7ae9-454c-adad-dbc2964ab5ca" class="">Before, evil was recognized to be evil, murder was recognized to be murder, but now murder is a means to achieve a noble result. Murder, whether of one person or of a group of people, is justified, because the murderer, or the group that the murderer represents, justifies it as a means of achieving a result which will be beneficial to man. That is we sacrifice the present for the future – and it does not matter what means we employ as long as our declared purpose is to produce a result which we say will be beneficial to man. Therefore, the implication is that a wrong means will produce a right end and you justify the wrong means through ideation.</p><p id="30d25cd5-e763-4e3b-b293-1ec35d0e0224" class="">In the various crises that have taken place before, the issue has been the exploitation of things or of man; it is now the exploitation of ideas, which is much more pernicious, much more dangerous, because the exploitation of ideas is so devastating, so destructive. We have learned now the power of propaganda and that is one of the greatest calamities that can happen: to use ideas as a means to transform man. That is what is happening in the world today. Man is not important – systems, ideas, have become important. Man no longer has any significance. We can destroy millions of men as long as we produce a result and the result is justified by ideas. We have a magnificent structure of ideas to justify evil and surely that is unprecedented. Evil is evil; it cannot bring about good. War is not a means to peace. War may bring about secondary benefits, like more efficient aeroplanes, but it will not bring peace to man. War is intellectually justified as a means of bringing peace; when the intellect has the upper hand in human life, it brings about an unprecedented crisis.</p><p id="f78f6cba-4cb6-49b4-b968-5f79626dfa68" class="">There are other causes also which indicate an unprecedented crisis. One of them is the extraordinary importance man is going to sensate values, to property, to name, to caste and country, to the particular label you wear. You are either a Muslim or a Hindu, a Christian or a communist. Name and property, caste and country, have become predominantly important, which means that man is caught in sensate value, the value of things, whether made by the mind or by the hand. Things made by the hand or by the mind have become so important that we are killing, destroying, butchering, liquidating each other because of them. We are nearing the edge of a precipice; every action is leading us there, every political, every economic action is bringing us inevitably to the precipice, dragging us into this chaotic, confusing abyss. Therefore the crisis is unprecedented and it demands unprecedented action. To leave, to step out of that crisis, needs a timeless action, an action which is not based on idea, on system, because any action which is based on a system, on an idea, will inevitably lead to frustration. Such action merely brings us back to the abyss by a different route. As the crisis is unprecedented there must also be unprecedented action, which means that the regeneration of the individual must be instantaneous, not a process of time. It must take place now, not tomorrow; for tomorrow is a process of disintegration. If I think of transforming myself tomorrow I invite confusion, I am still within the field of destruction. Is it possible to change now? Is it possible completely to transform oneself in the immediate, in the now? I say it is.</p><p id="0e1569d3-c3ec-4afe-a012-80e352515c8b" class="">The point is that as the crisis is of an exceptional character to meet it there must be revolution in thinking; and this revolution cannot take place through another, through any book, through any organization. It must come through us, through each one of us. Only then can we create a new society, a new structure away from this horror, away from these extraordinarily destructive forces that are being accumulated, piled up; and that transformation comes into being only when you as an individual begin to be aware of yourself in every thought, action and feeling.</p><p id="b08a5a07-c63a-409d-9630-a9d4a7a3f9db" class="">Prejudice has something in common with ideals, beliefs and faiths. We must be able to think together; but our prejudices, our ideals and so on, limit the capacity and the energy required to think, to observe and examine together so as to discover for ourselves what lies behind all the confusion, misery, terror, destruction and tremendous violence in the world. To understand, not only the mere outward facts that are taking place, but also the depth and the significance of all this, we must be able to observe together – not you observing one way and the speaker another, but together observe the same thing. That observation, that examination, is prevented if we cling to our prejudices, to our particular experiences and our particular comprehension. Thinking together is tremendously important because we have to face a world that is rapidly disintegrating, degenerating, a world in which there is no sense of morality, where nothing is sacred, where no one respects another. To understand all this, not only superficially, casually, we have to enter into the depths of it, into what lies behind it. We have to enquire why it is that after all these millions of years of evolution, man, you and the whole world, have become so violent, callous, destructive, enduring wars and the atomic bomb. The technological world is evolving more and more; perhaps that may be one of the factors causing man to become like this. So, please let us think together, not according to my way or your way, but simply using the capacity to think.</p><p id="8db19e43-65e5-46a8-a324-9919944fce79" class="">Thought is the common factor of all mankind. There is no Eastern thought, or Western thought; there is only the common capacity to think, whether one is utterly poor or most sophisticated, living in an affluent society. Whether a surgeon, a carpenter, a labourer in the field, or a great poet, thought is the common factor of all of us. We do not seem to realize that thought is the common factor that binds us all. You think according to your capacity, to your energy, your experience and knowledge; another thinks differently according to his experience and conditioning. We are all caught in this network of thought. This is a fact, indisputable and actual.</p><p id="ed5b5206-d7d4-4e43-8186-60e98993224f" class="">We have been ‘programmed’ biologically, physically and also ‘programmed’ mentally, intellectually. We must be aware of having been programmed, like a computer. Computers are programmed by experts to produce the results that they want. And these computers will outstrip man in thought. These computers can gather experience, and from that experience learn, accumulate knowledge, according to their programme. Gradually they are going to outstrip all our thinking in accuracy and with greater speed. Of course they cannot compose as Beethoven, or as Keats, but they will outstrip our thinking.</p><p id="a061a3e1-9220-441d-8943-2ac08fb95ce6" class="">So, then, what is man? He has been programmed to be Catholic, protestant, to be Italian or British and so on. For centuries he has been programmed – to believe, to have faith, to follow certain rituals, certain dogmas; programmed to be nationalistic and to go to war. So his brain has become as a computer but not so capable because his thought is limited, whereas the computer, although being also limited, is able to think much more rapidly than the human being and can outstrip him.</p><p id="26f37d3f-1ab8-4e40-b368-fa8045e69359" class="">These are facts, this is what actually is going on. Then what becomes of man? Then what is man? If the robots and the computer can do almost all that the human being can do, then what is the future society of man? When cars can be built by the robot and the computer – probably much better – then what is going to become of man as a social entity? These and many other problems are facing us. You cannot any more think as Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. We are facing a tremendous crisis; a crisis which the politicians can never solve because they are programmed to think in a particular way – nor can the scientists understand or solve the crisis; nor yet the business world, the world of money. The turning point, the perceptive decision, the challenge, is not in politics, in religion, in the scientific world, it is in our consciousness. One has to understand the consciousness of mankind, which has brought us to this point. One has to be very serious about this matter because we are really facing something very dangerous in the world – where there is the proliferation of the atomic bomb which some lunatic will turn on. We all must be aware of all this.</p><p id="6c531fdd-b761-4cb3-9ab3-a102d9a0167c" class="">One has to be very very serious, not flippant, not casual but concerned, to understand this behaviour and how human thought has brought us all to this point. We must be able to penetrate very carefully, hesitantly, with deep observation, to understand together what is happening both out there and inwardly. The inward psychological activity always overcomes the outer, however many regulations, sanctions, decisions you may have outwardly, all these are shattered by our psychological desires, fears and anxieties, by the longing for security. Unless we understand that, whatever outward semblance of order we may have, inward disorder always overcomes that which is outwardly conforming, disciplined, regularized. There may be carefully constructed institutions – political, religious, economic – but whatever the construction of these may be, unless our inward consciousness is in total order, inward disorder will always overcome the outer. We have seen this historically, it is happening now in front of our eyes. This is a fact.</p><p id="d9d7b976-4db2-4a22-bd9f-bb61cd132461" class="">The turning point is in our consciousness. Our consciousness is a very complicated affair. Volumes have been written about it, both in the East and in the West. We are not aware of our own consciousness; to examine that consciousness in all its complexity one has to be free to look to be choicelessly aware of its movement. it is not that the speaker is directing you to look or to listen to all the inward movement of consciousness in a particular way. Consciousness is common to all mankind. Throughout the world man suffers inwardly as well as outwardly there is anxiety, uncertainty, utter despair of loneliness; there is insecurity, jealousy, greed, envy and suffering. Human consciousness is one whole; it is not your consciousness or mine. This is logical, sane, rational: wherever you go, in whatever climate you live, whether you are affluent or degradingly poor, whether you believe in god, or in some other entity, belief and faith are common to all mankind – the images and symbols may be totally different in various localities but they stem from something common to all mankind. This is not a mere verbal statement. If you take it as a verbal statement, as an idea, as a concept, then you will not see the deep significance involved in it. The significance is that your consciousness is the consciousness of all humanity because you suffer, you are anxious, you are lonely, insecure, confused, exactly like others, though they live ten thousand miles away. The realization of it, the feeling of it – the feeling in your guts – is totally different from the mere verbal acceptance. When you realize that you are the rest of mankind, it brings a tremendous energy, you have broken through the narrow groove of individuality the narrow circle of me and you, we and they. We are examining together this very complex consciousness of man, not the European man, not the Asiatic man or the Middle East man, but this extraordinary movement in time that has been going on in consciousness for millions of years.</p><p id="286897f1-344d-4af5-8d83-70c2707d93b9" class="">Please do not accept what the speaker is saying; if you do it will have no meaning. If you do not begin to doubt, begin to question, be sceptical to enquire, if you hold on to your own particular belief, faith, experience or the accumulated knowledge, then you will reduce it all to some kind of pettiness with very little meaning. If you do that you will not be facing the tremendous issue that is facing man.</p><p id="1eb48563-de8f-4389-8a3c-865228cae669" class="">We have to see what our actual consciousness is. Thought and all the things that thought has put together, is part of our consciousness – the culture in which we live, the aesthetic values, the economic pressures, the national inheritance. If you are a surgeon or a carpenter, if you specialize in a particular profession, that group consciousness is part of your consciousness. If you live in a particular country with its particular tradition and religious culture, that particular group-consciousness has become part of your consciousness. These are facts. If you are a carpenter you have to have certain skills, understand the nature of wood and the tools of the trade, so you gradually belong to a group that has cultivated these special skills and that has its own consciousness – similarly the scientist, the archaeologist, just as the animals have their own particular consciousness as a group. If you are a housewife you have your own particular group consciousness, like all the other housewives. Permissiveness has spread throughout the world; it began in the far West and has spread right through the world. That is a group-conscious movement. See the significance of it; go into it for yourself, see what is involved in it.</p><p id="e92006ce-a02a-4e95-b4c6-233c0600b5dd" class="">Our consciousness includes, in the much deeper consciousness, our fears. Man has lived with fear for generation after generation. He has lived with pleasure, with envy, with all the travail of loneliness, depression and confusion; and with great sorrow, with what he calls love and the everlasting fear of death. All this is his consciousness which is common to all mankind. Realize what it means: it means that you are no longer an individual. This is very hard to accept because we have been programmed, as is the computer, to think we are individuals. We have been programmed religiously to think that we have souls separate from all the others. Being programmed our brain works in the same pattern century after century.</p><p id="901da8b4-4d0b-43bf-a8eb-041513e85dd1" class="">If one understands the nature of our consciousness, then the particular endeavour of the ‘me’ that suffers has become something global, then a totally different activity will take place. That is the crisis we are in. We have been programmed; being programmed we can learn – occasionally have an insight – and our brain repeats itself over and over again. Just see the actual fact of that: one is a Christian, or a Buddhist or a Hindu; one is against Communism, one is a Communist or a Democrat, repeat, repeat, repeat. And in this state of repetition there is an occasional breakthrough.</p><p id="961abbba-3db6-4983-b881-f8cf1ccb469c" class="">So, how shall a human being – who is actually the rest of mankind – how shall he face this crisis, this turning point? How will you as a human being, who has evolved through millennia upon millennia, thinking as an individual – which is actually an illusion – face a turning point, see what actually is and in that very perception move totally in another direction?</p><p id="7a17984b-4002-48cc-955b-52385c510bcb" class="">Let us understand together what it means to look – to look at the actuality of thought. You all think, that is why you are here. You all think and thought expresses itself in words, or through a gesture, through a look, through some bodily movement. Words being common to each one of us, we understand through those words the significance of what is being said. Yet thought is common to all mankind – it is a most extraordinary thing if you have discovered that, for then you see that thought is not your thought, it is thought. We have to learn how to see things as they actually are – not as you are programmed to look. See the difference. Can we be free of being programmed and look? If you look as a Christian, a Democrat, a Communist, a Socialist or a Catholic or a protestant – which are all so many prejudices – then you will not be able to understand the enormity of the danger, the crisis, that we are facing. If you belong to a certain group, or follow a certain guru, or are committed to a certain form of action, then, because you have been programmed, you will be incapable of looking at things as they actually are. It is only if you do not belong to any organization, to any group, to any particular religion or nationality, that you can really observe. If you have accumulated a great deal of knowledge from books and from experience, your mind has already been filled, your brain is crowded with experience, with your particular tendencies and so on – all that is going to prevent you from looking. Can we be free of all that to look at what is actually happening in the world? – at the terror and the terrible religious sectarian divisions, one guru opposed to another idiotic guru, the vanity behind all that, the power, the position, the wealth of these gurus, it is appalling. Can you look at yourself – not as a separate human being but as a human being who is actually the rest of mankind? To have such a feeling means that you have tremendous love for human beings.</p><p id="64a73814-77d6-4f19-8467-68394b20ed04" class="">When you are able to see clearly, without any distortion, then you begin to enquire into the nature of consciousness, including the much deeper layers of consciousness. You have to enquire into the whole movement of thought, because it is thought that is responsible for all the content of consciousness, whether it is the deep or the superficial layers. If you had no thought there would be no fear, no sense of pleasure, no time; thought is responsible. Thought is responsible for the beauty of a great cathedral, but thought is also responsible for all the nonsense that takes place inside the cathedral. All the achievements of the great painters, poets, composers, are the activity of thought: the composer; inwardly hearing the marvellous sound, commits it onto paper. That is the movement of thought. Thought is responsible for all the gods in the world, all the saviours, all the gurus; for all the obedience and devotion; the whole is the result of thought which seeks gratification and escape from loneliness. Thought is the common factor of all mankind. The poorest villager in India thinks as the chief executive thinks, as the religious leader thinks. That is a common everyday fact. That is the ground on which all human beings stand. You cannot escape from that.</p><p id="29b9b991-5246-46fb-a3cc-dd45c2a0f35a" class="">Thought has done marvellous things to help man but it has also brought about great destruction and terror in the world. We have to understand the nature and the movement of thought; why you think in a certain way; why you cling to certain forms of thought; why you hold on to certain experiences; why thought has never understood the nature of death. We have to examine the very structure of thought – not your thought because it is fairly obvious what your thought is, for you have been programmed. But if you enquire seriously into what thinking is, then you enter into quite a different dimension – not the dimension of your own particular little problem. You must understand the tremendous movement of thought, the nature of thinking – not as a philosopher, not as a religious man, not as a member of a particular profession, or a housewife – the enormous vitality of thinking.</p><p id="0975e09d-a99a-4313-bdd1-2c679e284141" class="">Thought is responsible for all the cruelty, the wars, the war machines and the brutality of war, the killing, the terror, the throwing of bombs, the taking of hostages in the name of a cause, or without a cause. Thought is also responsible for the cathedrals, the beauty of their structure, the lovely poems; it is also responsible for all the technological development, the computer with its extraordinary capacity to learn and go beyond man-s thought. What is thinking? It is a response, a reaction, of memory. If you had no memory you would not be able to think. Memory is stored in the brain as knowledge, the result of experience. This is how our brain operates. First, experience; that experience may have been from the beginning of man, which we have inherited, that experience gives knowledge which is stored up in the brain; from knowledge there is memory and from that memory thought. Prom thought you act. Prom that action you learn more. So you repeat the cycle. Experience, knowledge, memory, thought, action; from that action learn more and repeat. This is how we are programmed. We are always doing this: having remembered pain, in the future avoid pain by not doing the thing that will cause pain, which becomes knowledge, and repeat that. Sexual pleasure, repeat that. This is the movement of thought. See the beauty of it, how mechanically thought operates. Thought says to itself: ‘I am free to operate.’ Yet thought is never free because it is based on knowledge and knowledge is obviously always limited. Knowledge must also be always limited because it is part of time. I will learn more and to learn more I must have time. I do not know Russian but I will learn it. It may take me six months or a year or a lifetime. Knowledge is the movement of time. Time, knowledge, thought and action; in this cycle we live. Thought is limited, so whatever action thought generates must be limited and such limitation must create conflict, must be divisive.</p><p id="f7aab32e-cc30-49ee-b1f1-aa5215e7d0e6" class="">If I say that I am a Hindu, that I am Indian, I am limited and that limitation brings about not only corruption but conflict because another says, ‘I am a Christian’ or ‘I am a Buddhist’, so there is conflict between us. Our life from birth to death is a series of struggles and conflicts from which we are always trying to escape, which again causes more conflict. We live and die in this perpetual and endless conflict. We never seek out the root of that conflict, which is thought, because thought is limited. Please do not ask, ‘How am I to stop thought?’ – that is not the point. The point is to understand the nature of thought, to look at it.</p></details></li></ul><h1 id="4a694bae-a3ae-4cec-bc07-472317fc0b5a" class="">Meditation </h1><ul id="c49c2ef3-446d-4873-9306-771ee584738a" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Meditation Instructions for Beginners</summary><p id="8f6db9b4-3b7e-4e54-9861-98b271e61ab3" class="">Start by developing your mental resilience.

In this position, rest your right hand in your lap palm up with your left hand laying gently on top of it, also palm up. Touch your thumbs together, creating an oval below the navel.

Who is encountering the pain? Try following your breath and see if you experience some relief.</p><p id="a25db17b-332d-415e-8f50-ede9ec0449b0" class="">The experts have different pointers about how to react if the pain still seems too much to endure. Some encourage you to adjust your posture to find relief. Others take a firmer stance, suggesting you hold your position and meditate on the pain. Try to sit as still as you can—you’ll find real benefit there—but be mindful that it is your choice. Either way, meditation shouldn’t be tormenting.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="705f43c9-46a2-4e8a-afff-48c8971f099e" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Meditation for Beginners: <strong>Time for Meditation</strong></summary><p id="215221d7-2089-40dc-b5e9-6947965e8199" class="">When we start, it’s advised to meditate for a very short time – just three to five minutes is enough. We’ll find that it’s actually hard to focus for any longer than that. It’s much better to have a short period where we’re more focused, than a long one where our minds wander off, daydream, or even fall asleep!</p><p id="090f1801-04dd-4478-81e3-35fdbc27eba7" class=""><strong>How Often to Meditate</strong></p><p id="60d3d6e0-2eae-4db0-b06f-a2c3ca34d855" class="">Sticking with it is key.

Any amount of time spent meditating is good, no matter how brief. Your meditation practice can be just 5 minutes. A starting point for beginners is 30 minutes but meditate for long enough that your mind and body calm. Once you are calm and relaxed, you can truly start your meditation practice. Sit long enough to go through the calming phase with time left to enjoy and benefit from meditation.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="43f05b96-9dcb-4e0b-96c8-7507d5a8b028" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Meditation for Beginners: Meditation and Attention - <strong>If I’m thinking during meditation, is that bad?</strong></summary><p id="5f90e91a-cc8b-4959-a0ca-142f3be61b32" class="">In meditation, our goal is not to shut off our minds completely. Instead, the real challenge lies in swiftly recognizing when our focus has drifted and then redirecting it. This is particularly important when we find ourselves getting drowsy or losing alertness. It&#x27;s not an easy task because we often don&#x27;t even realize when our thoughts have strayed, especially when strong emotions are involved, like anger toward someone. However, the breath serves as a constant anchor, a stable point to which we can always return our attention.</p><p id="1d7489b5-d38b-47e6-a4d9-b1ac04fc0008" class="">Thinking is a natural and inherent part of our mental processes. Our minds are designed for thinking. In meditation, we aim to observe our thoughts as they arise, understanding how our minds function. The challenging aspect is letting go of those thoughts as effortlessly as they appear. This requires time and effort, but every meditation experience brings us closer to this skill.</p><p id="668f8e96-0496-4283-99e2-7ef93f02a5f5" class="">When our mind wanders, we should acknowledge it as &quot;thinking&quot; without harsh judgment and gently return our focus to the outbreath. The practice involves repeatedly coming back to the present moment. Through this process, our mental fog, confusion, and ignorance gradually transform into clarity. &quot;Thinking&quot; becomes a term for recognizing and embracing both our clear perceptions and our moments of confusion. We aren&#x27;t trying to eliminate thoughts; instead, we are gaining insight into our defense mechanisms, negative self-beliefs, desires, and expectations, as well as our kindness, courage, and wisdom.</p></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><ul id="fe2638c1-9421-43b4-9e65-8da3943f77bf" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>A Simple Beginner Meditation Practice</summary><h3 id="ea42dbed-c858-49b0-a922-8eb6702bf8de" class="">Preparation</h3><ol type="1" id="6e4af28b-353c-4e38-a5e5-b1b96ce75042" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li><strong>Find a Quiet Space</strong>: Choose a quiet and comfortable place where you won&#x27;t be disturbed.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="604711d4-d51b-4506-8577-447906edb645" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Seated Position</strong>: Sit in a relaxed position.

It is a shared experience among meditators that when one initiates their meditation practice, they become acutely aware of an unexpected occurrence: the mind, which they hoped to quiet through meditation, becomes even more restless. Instead of achieving the tranquility they seek, they find themselves bombarded with a deluge of thoughts, far more than in their ordinary daily lives. While engaged in activities such as work, running a shop, or office tasks, these thoughts seldom cause distress. However, as soon as they sit down to meditate in a temple, mosque, or church, an overwhelming wave of thoughts engulfs them, pulling their attention in every direction.</p><p id="a65e379b-7770-49d4-a573-19ddca160619" class="">Initially, this experience can be maddening and perplexing. Meditators had hoped for inner peace and silence, yet the opposite seems to be happening. Why does this occur? The answer lies in the fact that these thoughts have always existed within you. Even during your daily activities, whether you were aware or not, these thoughts lingered in the background. What meditation does is bring these hidden thoughts to the forefront of your consciousness. Meditation doesn&#x27;t create more thoughts; it simply makes you aware of their continuous presence.</p><p id="c7da75ed-48c2-445b-a4b7-88b2296fe189" class="">To overcome distraction, it is crucial to commit to daily meditation practice for at least an hour or two. By disconnecting from external engagements, you can focus your full attention on your inner world. Initially, you may feel like you&#x27;ve opened Pandora&#x27;s box or entered a chaotic mental realm. You may even feel the urge to escape and return to your external preoccupations. However, it&#x27;s imperative to resist this temptation; otherwise, you&#x27;ll struggle to progress in your meditation journey.</p><p id="10c49743-628b-46cf-a918-6a94dea5f900" class="">Various techniques have been devised to confront inner turmoil. Transcendental Meditation, for instance, is a method not for achieving deep meditation but for avoiding the exploration of your inner reality. In this technique, a mantra is provided, and you are instructed to repeat it. While this may offer temporary relief from distractions, it merely keeps your mind occupied, much like your daily activities did. True meditation, on the other hand, requires you to confront and observe your inner chaos. Avoiding it only allows it to fester and grow.</p><p id="d2525a95-95ec-4c99-9e3c-7f6bd6185d5a" class="">Genuine meditation means not shying away from the inner madness but diving headfirst into it. You must face it and remain vigilant, as it is through awareness and observation that you will ultimately overcome it. Avoiding it only perpetuates its hold on you, and you have already spent enough time evading it. No external aids or mantras are necessary; just sit in silence. Zen meditation epitomizes this approach – simply sit in silence, doing nothing. It is one of the most challenging forms of meditation. Many individuals request support or mantras because sitting silently without external distractions is arduous. Your mind will concoct countless excuses to engage you. Your body may itch, your legs may fall asleep, and you might even imagine ants crawling on you. Your body is attempting to provide distractions, but you must resist them all.</p><p id="77119b98-4d8d-4638-93e9-5ccd0cc51aad" class="">The key is to remain unoccupied and observe whatever transpires within you. Eventually, you will notice thoughts starting to fade away. This pure, unadulterated form of meditation is transcendental meditation, though it cannot be referred to as such due to trademark restrictions imposed by certain entities.</p><p id="cf2d37f8-067a-4895-b082-5128186b0f1c" class="">This scenario of commercializing meditation is not unique. Indian gurus who have ventured to America have not succeeded in changing others but have been influenced by American business culture. Instead of transforming individuals, they have become entrepreneurs, adopting American ways. True spiritual transformation does not necessitate such actions, as those genuinely seeking change will naturally gravitate toward it.</p><p id="5192c9f6-c53e-42c2-8065-bdfa26c0d990" class="">To combat distraction, you must remain conscious of it and observe it. Your mind is adept at employing various tactics to divert your attention. Repressed thoughts and desires will resurface, and your mind will tempt you with enticing distractions. It may conjure images of beautiful beings or vivid sensory experiences to entice you away from meditation. Consequently, my guidance to my followers is to avoid repression. Repression only hinders meditation, as it forces you to confront these suppressed thoughts during your practice. These repressed thoughts gain strength and manifest powerfully in your unconscious mind.</p><p id="fb4e72a6-3a08-4da9-8a2f-45995c48eadb" class="">Repression creates an inner turmoil that hampers meditation. This is why I emphasize the importance of releasing these repressions, as it paves the way for effortless meditation. When you no longer carry the burden of repressed thoughts and desires, meditation becomes as simple as a feather gracefully descending to the ground or a withered leaf gently falling from a tree.</p><p id="ce2cc235-b859-4590-8325-3f2763d2d344" class="">Meditation should be easy, as it aligns with your natural state of being. The difficulty arises from the countless repressions imposed by society, which act as distractions. Nevertheless, by remaining aware of these distractions and consistently returning to your center, you can gradually extend the time spent in focused meditation, while distractions diminish. Eventually, you will reach a point where you are centered, free from distraction. This is a profound accomplishment, as it signifies that you have recognized your divine nature and transcended the illusion that you are anything less than a god, having temporarily dreamt of being a beggar.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="85726a87-0fd9-41a7-b8e7-045e66720526" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Progress in Meditation</summary><p id="040959f7-e419-42f2-be1a-3163bab460a6" class="">When meditating, working on yourself, if you wonder whether you are making any progress or not, know well that you are not making any progress - because when progress is made you know it.</p><p id="6ad8389f-92e2-4cc8-998a-1c974a99460f" class="">Why? It is just like when you are ill and you are taking medicine. Won&#x27;t you be able to feel whether you are getting healthy or not? If you do not feel it and the question arises whether you are getting well or not, know well that you are not getting well. Well-being is such a clear feeling that when you have it you know it.</p><p id="5eab146e-5f06-44aa-91aa-d1464d5e695e" class="">But why does this question arise? This question arises for so many reasons. One, you are not really working. You are just deceiving yourself. You are playing tricks with yourself. Then you are less concerned with what you are doing and more concerned with what is happening. If you are really doing it, you can leave the result to the Divine. But our minds are such that we are less concerned with the cause and more concerned with the effect - because of greed.</p><p id="e8773fc4-051d-40ad-a3fe-fe64515ca8de" class="">Greed wants to have everything without doing anything. So the greedy mind goes on moving ahead. Then the greedy mind asks, &quot;What is happening? Is something happening or not?&quot; Be really concerned with what you are doing, and when something happens you will know it. It is going to happen to YOU. You need not ask anyone.</p><p id="ea568fba-d9d1-49c5-8d83-dbbe75e811a8" class="">Another reason for asking this question is that we think that there are going to be some signs, some symbols, some milestones we can reach that show: &quot;I have progressed so much,&quot; that &quot;to this plane or to that plane I have reached so much.&quot; We want to calculate before the ultimate goal is reached.</p><p id="caf8bd46-6967-43be-9af5-cb55ad267ec4" class="">We want to be confident that we are progressing.</p><p id="111e8649-ae98-4781-b034-124f7aa9b9c3" class="">But, really, there are no milestones - because there is no fixed road. And everyone is on a different road; we are not on one road. Even if you are following one technique of meditation, you are not on the same road; you cannot be. There is no public path. Every path is individual and personal. So no one&#x27;s experiences on the path will be helpful to you; rather, they may be damaging.</p><p id="3544d796-68ae-4e91-82fc-53d395255f2f" class="">Someone may be seeing something on his path. If he says to you that this is the sign of progress, you may not meet the same sign on your path. The same trees may not be on your path; the same stones may not be on your path. So do not be a victim of all this nonsense. Only certain inner feelings are relevant. For example, if you are progressing, then certain things will begin to happen spontaneously. One, you will feel more and more contentment.</p><p id="7f68793a-16cc-4b84-8eff-86283f27c764" class="">Really, when meditation is completely fulfilled, one becomes so contented that he forgets to meditate - because meditation is an effort, a discontent. If one day you forget to meditate and you do not feel any addiction, you do not feel any gap, you are as filled as ever, then know it is a good sign. There are many who will do meditation, and then if they are not doing it a strange phenomenon happens to them. If they do it, they do not feel anything. If they do not do it, then they feel the gap. If they do it, nothing happens to them. If they do not do it, then they feel that something is missing.</p><p id="0447c295-b6aa-4477-89f1-c1c01c9b3bd9" class="">This is just a habit. Like smoking, like drinking, like anything, this is just a habit. Do not make meditation a habit. Let it be alive! Then discontent will disappear by and by; you will feel contentment. And not only while you are meditating. If something happens only while you are meditating, it is false! It is hypnotic! It does some good, but it is not going to be very deep. It is good only in comparison. If there is nothing happening, no meditation, no blissful moment, do not worry about it. If something is happening, do not cling to it. If meditation is going rightly, deep, you will feel transformed throughout the whole day. A subtle contentment will be present every moment. With whatsoever you are doing, you will feel a cool center inside - contentment.</p><p id="bdd8b603-0790-4daf-a1d1-b110b49011b4" class="">Of course, there will be results. Anger wi!l be less and less possible. It will go on disappearing.</p><p id="ddafabf1-c350-4e38-a759-96d0a3f47a3a" class="">Why? Because anger shows a non-meditative mind - a mind that is not at ease with itself. That is why you get angry with others., Basically, you are angry with yourself. Because you are angry with yourself, you go on getting angry with others.</p><p id="4321781c-5be8-4adb-b3a4-36556a023c29" class="">Have you observed that you get angry only with those people who are very intimate with you? The more the intimacy, the more the anger. Why? The greater the gap between you and the person. the less the anger that will be there. You do not get angry with a stranger. You get angry with your wife, with your husband, with your son, with your daughter, with your mother. Why? Why do you get more angry with the persons who are more intimate with you?</p><p id="52ebeafb-4e9a-4bf3-81d0-4fe21b832217" class="">The reason is this: you are angry with yourself. The more intimate a person is with you, the more he has become identified with you. You are angry with yourself, so whenever someone is near to you.</p><p id="21ffe00c-1ce1-44c3-9037-397d8bb1ca99" class="">you can throw your anger upon him. Hc has become part of you. With meditation you will be more and more happy with yourself - remember, with yourself.</p><p id="48f5fe37-9c9c-4ea5-85b5-3c38f0a880ea" class="">It is a miracle when someone becomes happier with himself. For us, either we are happy with someone or angry with someone. When one becomes happier with oneself, this is really falling in love with oneself. And when you are in love with yourself, it is difficult to be angry. The whole thing becomes absurd. Less and less anger will be there, more and more love, and more compassion.</p><p id="7ca604dc-5084-4341-8942-bca933220226" class="">These will be signs - the general signs.</p><p id="2c5d64e5-4fc1-4769-a249-411862344286" class="">So do not think you are achieving much if you are beginning to see light or if you go on seeing beautiful colours. They are good, but do not feel satisfied unless real psychological changes are there: less anger, more love; less cruelty, more compassion.</p><p id="fb49d69a-4941-445f-9d95-a4d3acf23dab" class="">Unless this happens, your seeing lights and colours and hearing sounds are child&#x27;s play. They are beautiful, very beautiful; it is good to play with them - but that is not the aim of meditation. They happen on the road, they are just by-products, but do not be concerned.</p><p id="b852535a-ab66-4bda-aac1-ec8e64cf4113" class="">Many people will come to me and they will say, &quot;Now I am seeing a blue light, so what does this sign mean? How much have I progressed?&quot; A blue light will not do because your anger is giving a red light. Basic psychological changes are meaningful, so do not go for toys. These are toys, spiritual toys, but you can become a paramahans if you see a blue light!</p><p id="c544f66a-069a-4bb8-952f-895e1853e92f" class="">These things are not the ends. In a relationship, observe what is happening. How are you behaving toward your wife now? Observe it. Is there any change? That change is meaningful. How are you behaving with your servant? Is there any change? That change is significant. And if there is no change, then throw your blue light. It is of no help. You are deceiving and you can go on deceiving.</p><p id="b26a58eb-4b61-4c3c-bc75-d28e96c24d7b" class="">These are easily achieved tricks.</p><p id="eb42ea44-881d-42f0-940f-503206d5b690" class="">That is why a so-called religious man begins to feel himself religious: because now he is seeing this and that, but he remains the same. He even becomes worse! Your progress must be observed in your relationships. Relationship is the mirror: see your face there. Always remember that relationship is the mirror. If your meditation is going deep, your relationships will become different - totally different! Love will be the basic note of your relationships, not violence. As it is, violence is the basic note. Even if you look at someone, you look in a violent way. But you are accustomed to it.</p><p id="981aefe4-1aaa-4a37-93a9-b398457bf3a6" class="">Meditation for me is not a child&#x27;s play. It is a deep transformation. How to know this transformation?</p><p id="1e061b84-1345-404d-8f45-8ad3902b7a47" class="">It is being reflected every moment in your relationships. Do you try to possess someone? Then you are violent. How can one possess anyone? Are you trying to dominate someone? Then you are violent. How can one dominate anyone? Love cannot dominate, love cannot possess.</p><p id="5f618745-51ee-41b9-8bca-464ae32bc37d" class="">So whatsoever you are doing, be aware, observe it, and then go on meditating. Soon you will begin to feel the change. Now there is no possessiveness in relationships. By and by, possessiveness disappears, and when possessiveness is not there relationship has a beauty of its own. When possessiveness is there, everything becomes dirty, ugly, inhuman. But we are such deceivers that we will not look at ourselves in relationships - because there the real face can be seen. So we close our eyes to our relationships and we go on thinking that something is going to be seen inside.</p><p id="e80af184-db73-4355-813b-f61a303e3721" class="">You cannot see anything inside. First you will feel your inner transformation in your outer relationships, and then you will go deep. Then only will you begin to feel something inner. But we have a settled attitude about ourselves. We do not want to look into our relationships at all because then the naked face comes up.</p><p id="d6ff9515-eb1c-43de-b02d-63253fa8263a" class="">Mulla Nasrudin&#x27;s marriage was arranged by his father. It was an arranged marriage, so Mulla had not seen the face of his would-be wife. Then on the wedding day, when the ceremony was over, the wife unveiled her face. She was terribly ugly, and while Mulla was just stunned by the shock she asked, &quot;Now tell me, my love, your commands.&quot; That is a Mohammedan system. The first thing the wife asks is, &quot;Tell me your commands, my love. To whom do I have to remain veiled? To whom am I allowed to show my face?&quot;</p><p id="c5bcf9fe-1a06-4deb-ab49-2f98192aceae" class="">Mulla Nasrudin said - rather, groaned - &quot;You can show your face to anyone you like, as long as you do not show it to me! This is a contract.&quot;</p><p id="a8f89f8d-ba56-4b94-b1f7-19eb0e73d49f" class="">We are also in a contract with ourselves. We go on showing our faces to everyone, but never to ourselves. That is a deep contract we have with ourselves - not to feel one&#x27;s face. And the way to remain veiled is not to look into your relationships, because relationship is the only mirror. So probe, penetrate into your relationships, and look there to see whether your meditation is progressing or not.</p><p id="5157fc53-8789-4c2d-b852-0d91ba0215e5" class="">If you feel a growing love, unconditional love, if you feel a compassion without cause, if you feel a deep concern for everyone&#x27;s welfare, well-being, your meditation is growing. Then forget all other things. With this observation you will also observe many things in yourself. You will be more silent, less noise within. When there is need you will talk, when there is no need you will be silent. As the case is now, you cannot be silent within. You will feel more at ease, relaxed. Whatsoever you are doing, it will be a relaxed effort; there will be no strain. You will become less and less ambitious.</p><p id="840a5d5e-20ab-485e-bb58-f9e188a073bd" class="">Ultimately, there will be no ambition. Even the ambition to reach moksha will not be there. When you feel that even the desire to reach moksha has disappeared, you have reached moksha. Now you are free, because desire is the bondage. Even the desire for liberation is a bondage. Even the desire to be desireless is a bondage.</p><p id="9461c722-b950-431a-99ea-3db808d2978c" class="">Whenever the desire for anything disappears, you move into the unknown. The meditation has reached to its end. Then sansar is moksha. Then this very world is liberation. Then this shore is the other shore. But do not go for childish signs. Do not go! They are easy to create. If you think, if you imagine, you can create them.</p><p id="495200bd-df7a-4b32-a680-6390e1deb3b2" class="">I do not mean that every feeling of those signs is imagination, but if you think in those terms you can imagine them. If you think that a blue light will happen at a particular stage, you can create it without reaching to that stage. This is very easy; to reach to that stage is very difficult. To create this blue light is very easy. Close your eyes, concentrate on it, and within a few days you will begin to feel it. Then your ego will be strengthened. Now you are &quot;on a spiritual path&quot;. Think of kundalini, and you will begin to feel it in your spine. That is imagination. It is easy, not difficult. But then you are misleading yourself.</p><p id="865914ff-317c-4bb5-b377-a65f65bbcd92" class="">I do not say that every experience of that type is imagination, but if you are concerned, it is going to be imagination. Forget it completely. Be concerned with meditation, with your changing relationships, with your silence, with your contentment, with your love. Be concerned with these, and suddenly sometimes, there will be an upsurge of energy into your spine. But do not be concerned with it. Note it down and forget it. Suddenly, you will see a particular light: note it and forget.</p><p id="e491d2af-da77-443e-8532-16591092ea09" class="">Suddenly a particular chakra will begin to revolve: note it and forget it. Do not be concerned with it. Your concern is harmful. Remain concerned with contentment, peace, silence, love, compassion, meditation.</p><p id="1d1d2404-b010-46d5-bba6-ab5878aa2ff9" class="">These things will go on happening. Then they are real. When you are not concerned and they happen, then they are real. And they show many things, but you need not know what they show because when they happen you know what they are showing. Because the human mind is stupid, if I tell you what they show you will be less concerned with love, silence and compassion. These are very difficult things. It is easy to create a blue light and it is very easy to feel a snake rising in your spine. It is very easy; there is nothing difficult about it.</p><p id="d1595b33-2679-4706-8794-b12db3c1fef0" class="">So, remember, there are two types of inner experience. One type is created by your imagination, another is of happenings. But for happenings, you are not needed; for imagination you are. Do not play with imagination. It is a dangerous game. One can imagine anything, you can imagine anything, but that is not going to help you in any way. And the mind is such that it always tries to find some false substitute, because false substitutes are cheap.</p><p id="05b2b455-cee5-438d-80a0-2090448e7c6c" class="">If you have to grow a real rose in your garden, it takes time. It demands patience, effort, and then too nothing is certain. The rose may come, it may not come. It is easy to buy a rose, but then it is not yours. rt looks just as if it has come up in your garden, but it has not come up. When you purchase a rose-flower, it has no roots in you: it is just in your hand. It has not been a part of your being. You have never waited for it; you were not patient for it. It is not a child - not your child. You have purchased it. It is there, but like a foreign element in you, not an inner growth.</p><p id="eed326e1-0e60-481c-8fd9-efe0aedc0079" class="">But there are even more cunning people. They will not purchase a real flower. They will purchase a paper flower, a plastic flower, because it is more permanent. A real flower will fade away. By the evening it will be no more - &quot;So purchase a plastic flower! It is economical, less troublesome, permanent!&quot; But then you are deceiving. Real growth needs time, patience, work. Imaginative growth is imitation. Remember this distinction always.</p><p id="e7d3230a-f5dc-4d54-bbdf-743e682232b0" class="">One thing more: whatsoever you are doing, do not think that results will be coming in the future. If you are doing something real, results are here and now. In inner work, if you have meditated today, results are not going to be tomorrow. If you have meditated today. the perfume of it, howsoever little, will be there. If you are sensitive you can feel it. Whenever something real is done, it affects you here and now.</p><p id="29c0aea6-cbaf-4801-9999-6e3b53964b06" class="">So do not think that something will happen in the future. If whatsoever you are doing is not changing you now, it is not going to change you at all. Time will not help. Time alone will not help. Time will deepen it, but time alone will not help.</p><p id="38099ed1-c388-4819-84e3-d4035b47e889" class="">But you may not be sensitive. Whatsoever you are doing, you may not be sensitive. We have become insensitive because in insensitivity there is a certain security. If you do not feel much, you suffer less. The person who feels much suffers much. Because of this, we have tried to make ourselves insensitive. So when something happens so intensely that it is impossible to avoid it, then only do we become aware. Other vise we go dead, asleep. We move on. That insensitivity will create problems. Then when you meditate, you will not be sensitive to what is happening to you.</p><p id="e22fabc0-1c7f-44a2-a3f8-e2376673dde4" class="">So be more sensitive. And you cannot be sensitive in one dimension. Either one is sensitive in all dimensions or one is not sensitive in any. Sensitivity belongs to your total being. So be more sensitive; then every day you will be able to feel what is happening.</p><p id="5b8172c5-0364-4771-be7c-5d8e5e18b2d7" class="">For example, you are walking under the sun., Feel the rays on your face; be sensitive. A subtle touch is there. They are hitting you. If you can feel them, then you will also feel the inner light when it hits you; otherwise you will not be able to.</p><p id="07517076-449a-4e17-b920-022c192ea27b" class="">When you are Lying in a park, feel the grass. Feel the greenness that surrounds you, feel the difference of moisture, feel the odour that comes from the earth. If you cannot feel it, you will not be able to feel when inner things begin to happen. Then you will go on asking whether you are progressing or not.</p><p id="9d3060aa-f7bd-4b97-b3de-0215af18e56c" class="">Start from the outer, because that is easier. And if you cannot Feel the outer, you cannot feel the inner. Be more poetic and less businesslike in life. And sometimes it costs nothing to be sensitive.</p><p id="2b27ee3d-a68d-49d7-a30e-961b2fce18aa" class="">You are taking your bath: have you felt the water? You simply take it as a business routine, and then you are out. Feel it for a few minutes. Just be under the shower and feel the water: feel it flowing on you. It can become a deep experience, because water is life. You are ninety percent water. And if you cannot feel water falling on you, you will not be able to feel the inner tides of your own water.</p><p id="18b3b859-4dc7-479c-8ef6-d3a3a2bd0095" class="">Life was born in the sea and you have some water within your body with a certain quantity of salt.</p><p id="7a76c22e-3863-48ce-a28f-d02eb54dfcff" class="">Go on swimming in the sea and feel the water outside. Soon you will know that you are part of the sea and that the inner part belongs to the sea. Then you can feel that also. And when the moon is there and the ocean is waving in response to it, your body will also wave in response. It waves, but you cannot feel it. So if you cannot feel such gross things, it will be difficult for you to feel such subtle things as meditation.</p><p id="6d2a8aaa-2808-4986-961d-6b2a3ca73a95" class="">How can you feel love? Everyone is suffering. I have seen thousands and thousands of people deeply in pain. The suffering is for love. They want to love and they want to be loved, but the problem is that if you ever love them they cannot feel it. They will go on asking, &quot;Do you love me?&quot;</p><p id="266903f7-718d-412a-8c39-12c75a89320e" class="">So what to do? If you say yes, they won&#x27;t believe it because they cannot feel it. If you say no, they feel hurt.</p><p id="4c254301-a79c-4c5f-a4ef-ece3abe26473" class="">If you cannot feel sunrays, if you cannot feel rains, if you cannot feel grass, if you cannot feel anything that surrounds you - the atmosphere, then you cannot feel deeper things such as love or compassion; it is very difficult. You can feel only anger, violence, sadness, because they are so crude. Subtle is the path that goes inward - and the more subtle your meditation goes, the more subtle will be the feelings. But then you have to be ready.</p><p id="5074c753-63d3-4ce9-b6a3-03b52a8cc301" class="">So meditation is not just a certain thing which you do for one hour and forget. Really, the whole life has to be meditative. Only then will you begin to feel things. And when I say that the whole life is to be meditative, I do not mean to go and close your eyes for twenty-four hours and sit and meditate - no! Wherever you are you can be sensitive and that sensitivity will pay. Then there will be no need to ask, &quot;Am I progressing or not?&quot;</p><p id="20e06fa7-f8b2-4d2f-88f4-86b113a66f7b" class="">You are like a blind man. You cannot feel the path because you have never felt anything. And the way we are taught, educated, cultivated, is for insensitivity. A child is weeping; the whole house is against him: &quot;Do not weep! Guests are coming.&quot; Guests are very important, and the child weeping is not at all important. Now you are crushing him for his whole life.</p><p id="b0144f50-f75d-47ef-a8db-70dfde702159" class="">He will stop his weeping, but to-stop weeping is a serious affair. It will change the whole metabolism of his body. To stop weeping he will have to be tense; he cannot be relaxed. He has to push something under which is coming up. He will have to change his breathing. Really, he will stop his breathing - because if the breathing moves easily, weeping will move with it. He will pull in his stomach; everything will be disturbed in his body. Then he will not weep, but he cannot laugh either.</p><p id="b6964580-b95f-4b0c-be11-6727bb8aafcd" class="">Then you are crippling him for his whole life.</p><p id="9905f767-be1a-46a2-a4e2-a9f9880e70b9" class="">Everyone is crippled and paralyzed. We live in a paralyzed world. Now there will be continuous suppression. He cannot laugh, he cannot weep, he cannot dance, he cannot jump. Whatsoever his body feels to do, he cannot do. Whenever the body feels to have something, it cannot have it. And then, when you allow him to play, it is not spontaneous. Even his play becomes fake. You say, &quot;Now you can play.&quot; He was not allowed to play when his whole being was ready to play, and now you tell him to play. But now he tries to play, and it is a work.</p><p id="d1df01f3-929b-4998-be97-1f3b2eb223e7" class="">Ultimately we create a human being who is more or less an automaton. Can you weep? Can you laugh spontaneously? Can you dance spontaneously? Can you love spontaneously? If you cannot, how can you meditate? Can you play? It is difficult!</p><p id="dd8c9f3b-2100-45b1-bae0-47c5f2ac47b2" class="">Everything has become difficult. Man has become insensitive. Bring your sensitivity back again.</p><p id="dc2944c6-5872-4ad1-86c2-76087f5a55f4" class="">Reclaim it! Play a little! To be playful is to be religious. Laugh, weep, sing, do something spontaneously with your full heart. Relax your body, relax your breathing, and move as if you are a child again. Then when you meditate, you will not ask, &quot;What is happening to me? Am I progressing or not, or am I moving in a circle?&quot; You will know.</p><p id="37edc466-6f6c-4af7-9fdd-19498631f1a3" class="">I understand your difficulty. You cannot feel it now because you have lost feeling. Regain feeling - less thought, more feeling. Live more by heart, less by head. Sometimes, live totally in the body; forget about soul, Self, ATMAN. Live totally in the body - because if you cannot even feel your body, you are not going to feel your soul. Remember this. Come back into the body. We are really hanging around the body; we are not in the body. Everyone is afraid to be in the body. Society has created the fear; it is deep-rooted. Go back into your body; move again; be like an innocent animal.</p><p id="292d76ce-e849-4e49-b445-b13b5170e711" class="">Look at animals jumping, running. Sometimes run and jump like them, then you will come back to your body. Then you will be able to feel your body, the rays of the sun, the rains, and the wind blowing. Only with this capacity of being aware of all things happening around you will you develop the capacity to feel what is happening within.</p><figure id="6e45b835-96b3-4b01-8fc0-def26bf4e3fa" class="image"><a href="https://oshofriends.com/index.php?act=copytrack&amp;mid=talks_on_meditation&amp;document_srl=71569"><img src="https://oshofriends.com/index.php?act=copytrack&amp;mid=talks_on_meditation&amp;document_srl=71569"/></a></figure><p id="f9f64b4e-bae8-4d6e-ac6c-e1ef2a20fdb0" class="">[Title] : Will you please explain in detail about those factors which indicate the meditator&#x27;s constant progress?</p><p id="c0f321ac-3ecd-46f3-aa77-32817826b2f1" class="">[Source] : https://oshofriends.com/talks_on_meditation/71569</p><p id="49b99948-fe01-46dd-8a69-0bb055baae5d" class="">

Is that what you call meditation? Be simple, be honest. That is what? Every day taking a certain period and going to a room and sitting down quietly for ten minutes or half an hour to meditate? Is meditation concentration, thinking about something very noble? Any conscious effort to meditate is part of your discipline of the office, because you say: If I meditate, I’ll have a quiet mind, or I’ll enter into another state. The word ‘meditation’ also means to measure, which means compare. So your meditation becomes mechanical because you are exercising energy to concentrate on a picture, an image, or an idea, and that concentration divides. Concentration is always divisive; you want to concentrate on something, but thought wanders off; then you say you mustn’t wander off, and you come back. You repeat that all day long, or for half an hour. Then you come off it and say you have meditated. This meditation is advocated by all the gurus, by all the lay disciples. The Christian idea is: ‘I believe in God and I’m sacrificing myself to God; therefore, I pray to save my soul.’ Is all this meditation? I know nothing about this kind of meditation; it’s like an achievement; if I meditate for half an hour, I feel better. Or is there a totally different kind of meditation? Don’t accept anything that the speaker says, at any price. The speaker says that that is not meditation at all. That’s merely a process of achievement. If one day you have not been able to concentrate, you take a month and say: ‘Yes, I’ve got it.’ That’s like a clerk becoming a manager. So is there a different kind of meditation which is not effort, which is not measurement, which is not routine, which is not mechanical? Is there a meditation in which there is no sense of comparison, or in which there is no reward and punishment? Is there any meditation which is not based on thought which is measurement, time, and all that?</p><p id="1540c76d-bdff-4018-b12f-cec173cf44ea" class="">How can one explain a meditation that has no measurement, that has no achievement, that doesn’t say: ‘I’m this, but I’ll become that’? ‘That’ being god or superangel. Is there a meditation which has nothing to do with will – an energy that says: ‘I must meditate’? Is there a meditation which as nothing to do with effort at all? The speaker says there is. You don’t have to accept it. He may be talking nonsense, but he sees logically that the ordinary meditation is self-hypnosis, deceiving oneself. And, when you stop deceiving, stop all that mechanical process, is there a different kind of meditation? And unfortunately, the speaker says: Yes. But you can’t get at it through effort, through giving all your energy to something. It is something that has to be absolutely silent. First of all, begin very humbly, very, very humbly and, therefore, very gently and, therefore, no pushing, driving, saying: ‘I must do this.’ It requires a tremendous sense not only of aloneness, but a sense of – I mustn’t describe it to you. I mustn’t describe it because then you’ll go off on descriptions. If I describe it, the description is not the real. The description of the moon is not the moon, and a painting of the Himalayas is not the Himalayas. So, we’ll stop describing. It’s for you to play with it, or not play with it, going your own way with your own peculiar achievements through meditation, reward and all the rest of it. So, in meditation which is absolutely no effort, no achievement, no thinking, the brain is quiet; not made quiet by will, by intention, by conclusion and all that nonsense; it is quiet. And, being quiet, it has infinite space.</p></details></li></ul><ul id="a13694ed-6d0a-4a60-a304-688757fe60e8" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>India, the East and Meditation</summary><p id="d2180351-105b-4805-91bd-00b8f624fa5d" class="">I don&#x27;t know why the mysticism, if it is mysticism at all and not self hypnosis and illusion, why the Orient, the East, has this peculiar dominance over the West about spirituality, as though they have got it in their pocket and give it out to you. Most of them do at a considerable expense, you have to pay for it: or they use that as a means of exploiting you in the name of an idea or a promise. I don&#x27;t know why, both in India and those unfortunate people who come out of that country, there is a peculiar feeling that being an old civilisation, having talked a great deal about this peculiar quality of spirituality, that they therefore have this authority. I&#x27;m afraid they haven&#x27;t - they are just like you and me, they are as confused, dull, clever with their tongues, and they have learnt one or two tricks and try to convey to others the method, the system of meditation.</p><p id="7d0a44a7-3d9f-43c1-918f-15d6c413f528" class="">So that word has become rather spoilt; like love it has been besmirched.

The understanding of that life and the extraordinary meaning of death is meditation; not searching out some deep mystical experience; not - as it is done in the East - a repetition of words, as the Catholics and others also do, a constant repetition of a series of words, however hallowed, however ancient. </p><p id="38773999-227d-4ee6-8bff-ba1298eac5cf" class="">That only makes the mind quiet, but it also makes the mind rather dull, stupid, mesmerised.

Every system or method binds thought to time but choiceless awareness of every thought and feeling, understanding their motives, their mechanism, allowing them to blossom is the beginning of meditation. When thought and feeling flourish and die, meditation is the movement beyond time. In this movement there is ecstasy; in complete emptiness there is love, and with love there is destruction and creation.</p></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><ul id="18924f9a-1ead-44c2-9aa6-17aa094da266" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Advanced Meditation Techniques</summary><ul id="da29e383-51da-4e9d-9d02-8ae2cdf84dc7" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Dynamic Meditation</summary><p id="3229e72b-a284-49f1-92c8-7d8617408815" class="">The Dynamic Meditation lasts one hour and is in five stages. It can be done alone, but the energy will be more powerful if it is done in a group. It is an individual experience so you should remain oblivious of others around you and keep your eyes closed throughout, preferably using a blindfold. It is best to have an empty stomach and wear loose, comfortable clothing.</p><p id="85b28af1-9ae5-4266-aad5-a78375757723" class=""><strong>First Stage</strong> – 10 minutes: Breathe chaotically through the nose, concentrating always on the exhalation. The body will take care of the inhalation. Do this as fast and as hard as you possibly can – and then a little harder, until you literally become the breathing. Use your natural body movements to help you to build up your energy. Feel it building up, but don’t let go during the first stage.</p><p id="605e93b5-870e-44fc-876e-ef52ad894827" class=""><strong>Second Stage</strong> – 10 minutes: Explode! Let go of everything that needs to be thrown out. Go totally mad, scream, shout, cry, jump, shake, dance, sing, laugh, throw yourself around. Hold nothing back, keep your whole body moving. A little acting often helps to get you started. Never allow your mind to interfere with what is happening. Be total.</p><p id="ebedf7ef-135c-4d29-9a65-3a776e827d68" class=""><strong>Third Stage</strong> – 10 minutes: With raised arms, jump up and down shouting the mantra ‘HOO! HOO! HOO!’ as deeply as possible. Each time you land, on the flats of your feet, let the sound hammer deep into the sex centre. Give all you have, exhaust yourself totally.</p><p id="5d4b6a17-0d4b-4f74-a047-e38725501ec2" class=""><strong>Fourth Stage</strong> – 15 minutes: Stop! Freeze where you are in whatever position you find yourself. Don’t arrange the body in any way. A Cough, a movement, anything will dissipate the energy flow and the effort will be lost. Be a witness to everything that is happening to you.</p><p id="0daa5632-1c6d-43d1-9078-72123f1083f2" class=""><strong>Fifth Stage</strong> – 15 minutes: Celebrate and rejoice with music and dance, expressing your gratitude towards the whole.

Now suppose we are walking to a sacred place. We would walk quietly and take each gentle step with reverence. I propose that we walk this way every time we walk on the earth. The earth is sacred and we touch her with each step. We should be very respectful, because we are walking on our mother. If we walk like that, then every step will be grounding, every step will be nourishing.</p><p id="8c79d12e-6dea-4aa5-97f9-ba77c3008d6e" class="">We can train ourselves to walk with reverence. Wherever we walk, whether it’s the railway station or the supermarket, we are walking on the earth and so we are in a holy sanctuary. If we remember to walk like that, we can be nourished and find solidity with each step.</p><p id="1f4bb6ce-29ec-4603-847d-3873f5653a8b" class="">To walk in this way, we have to notice each step. Each step made in mindfulness can bring us back to the here and the now. Go slowly. Mindfulness lights our way. We don’t rush. With each breath we may take just one step. We may have run all our life, but now we don’t have to run anymore. This is the time to stop running. To be grounded in the earth is to feel its solidity with each step and know that we are right where we are supposed to be.</p><p id="352e5cc6-72d4-4d0d-9a16-58f9445c1349" class="">Each mindful breath, each mindful step, reminds us that we are alive on this beautiful planet. We don’t need anything else. It is wonderful enough just to be alive, to breathe in, and to make one step. We have arrived at where real life is available—the present moment. If we breathe and walk in this way, we become as solid as a mountain.</p><p id="2e25115c-8717-4452-9b8c-45debc9256bb" class="">There are those of us who have a comfortable house, but we don’t feel that we are at home. We don’t want for anything, and yet we don’t feel at home. All of us are looking for our solid ground, our true home. The earth is our true home and it is always there, beneath us and around us. Breathe, take a mindful step, and arrive. We are already at home.</p><p id="a335fee6-a7d3-4112-8a75-99483fdcc543" class="">We can’t be grounded in our body if our mind is somewhere else. We each have a body that has been given us by the earth. This body is a wonder. In our daily lives, we may spend many hours forgetting the body. We get lost in our computer or in our worries, fear, or busyness. Walking meditation makes us whole again. Only when we are connected with our body are we truly alive. Healing is not possible without that connection. So walk and breathe in such a way that you can connect with your body deeply.</p><p id="a60fd26d-e764-4a64-9f6a-220b67784a19" class="">Walking meditation unites our body and our mind. We combine our breathing with our steps. When we breathe in, we may take two or three steps. When we breathe out, we may take three, four, or five steps. We pay attention to what is comfortable for our body. Our breathing has the function of helping our body and mind to calm down. As we walk, we can say, Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I bring peace into my body. Calming the breath calms the body and reduces any pain and tension.</p><p id="300432bc-ac5e-4460-ab49-f3baf3300c3f" class="">When we walk like this, with our breath, we bring our body and our mind back together. Our body and our mind are two aspects of the same reality. If we remove our mind from our body, our body is dead. If we take our body out of our mind, our mind is dead. Don’t think that one can be if the other is not.</p><p id="b53917ae-ff1e-49e2-b489-93df0ce0e44c" class="">Walking meditation is first and foremost a practice to bring body and mind together peacefully. No matter what we do, the place to start is to calm down, because when our mind and our body have calmed down, we see more clearly. When we see our anger or sadness clearly, it dissipates. We begin to feel more compassion for ourselves and others. We can only feel this when body and mind are united.</p><p id="a5dcf5c4-2e00-4652-879f-a4daf655ead3" class="">Walking meditation should not be work. It is very pleasant, especially in the early morning when the air is still very fresh. When we walk mindfully, we see the beauty and the wonder of the earth around us, and we wake up. We see that we are living a very wonderful moment. If our mind is caught and preoccupied with our worries and suffering, we miss these things. We can value each step we take, and each step brings us happiness. When we look again at the earth and the sky, we see that the earth is a wonderful reality.</p><p id="5a1b87da-4c7d-4df4-9d75-d91ead3b25c0" class="">We think that the earth is the earth and we are something outside of the earth. But in fact we are inside of the earth. Imagine that the earth is the tree and we are a leaf. The earth is not the environment, something outside of us that we need to care for. The earth is us. Just as your parents, ancestors, and teachers are inside you, the earth is in you. Taking care of the earth, we take care of ourselves.</p><p id="680a944c-0a97-4427-80fe-53d5d1752220" class="">When we see that the earth is not just the environment, that the earth is in us, at that moment you can have real communion with the earth. But if we see the earth as only the environment, with ourselves in the center, then we only want to do something for the earth in order for us to survive. But that is not enough. That is a dualistic way of seeing.</p><p id="8ddd16ec-ef4f-40ad-ac2f-7e392b30d3bb" class="">We have to practice looking at our planet not just as matter, but as a living and sentient being. The universe, the sun, and the stars have contributed many elements to the earth, and when we look into the earth we see that it’s a very beautiful flower containing the presence of the whole universe. When we look into our own bodily formation, we are made of the same elements as the planet. It has made us. The earth and the universe are inside of us.</p><p id="fb5bd4a3-91bd-4af9-a2fa-3a1ea971dcac" class="">When we take mindful steps on the earth, our body and mind unite, and we unite with the earth. The earth gave birth to us and the earth will receive us again. Nothing is lost. Nothing is born. Nothing dies. We don’t need to wait until after our body has disintegrated to go back to Mother Earth. We are going back to Mother Earth at every moment. Whenever we breathe, whenever we step, we are returning to the earth. Even when we scratch ourselves, skin cells will fall and return to the earth.</p><p id="59146f5a-6a4d-431f-946b-eefdbaeada4b" class="">Earth includes the life sphere and the atmosphere. So you don’t have to wait until you die to go back to Mother Earth, because you are already in Mother Earth. We have to return to take refuge in our beautiful planet. I know that earth is my home. I don’t need to die in order to go back to Mother Earth. I am in Mother Earth right now, and Mother Earth is in me.</p><p id="f5737de3-4fd3-47c0-9bda-9fbc2081d123" class="">You may like to try this exercise while you walk: Breathing in, I know Mother Earth is in me. Breathing out, I know Mother Earth is in me.</p><p id="d6b34701-ac27-4c91-8cc1-5a8cff325e76" class="">Paul Tillich, the German theologian, said, “God is not a person but not less than a person.” This is true of the earth as well. It is more than a person. It has given birth to millions of species, including human beings. Many ancient cultures believed there was a deity that inhabited the sun, and they worshiped the sun. But when I do walking meditation and touching the earth, I do not have that kind of dualistic view. I am not worshiping the earth as a separate deity outside of myself.</p><p id="c436ea12-45da-40cc-843d-0ca068c43d3a" class="">I think of the earth as a bodhisattva, a great and compassionate being. A bodhisattva is a being who has awakening, understanding, and love. Any living being who has awakening, peace, understanding, and love can be called a bodhisattva, but a bodhisattva doesn’t have to be a human being. When we look into a tree, we see the tree is fresh, it nourishes life, and it offers shade and beauty. It’s a place of refuge for so many birds and other creatures. A bodhisattva is not something that is up in the clouds far away from us. Bodhisattvas are all around us. A young person who has love, who has freshness, who has understanding, who offers us a lot of happiness, is a bodhisattva. The pine standing in the garden gives us joy, offers us oxygen, and makes life more beautiful.</p><p id="6bb75063-4c15-44d0-b3c6-b40586fcb158" class="">When we say that earth is a beautiful bodhisattva, this is not our imagination. It is a fact that the earth is giving life and she is very beautiful. The bodhisattva is not a separate spirit inhabiting the earth; we should transcend that idea. There are not two separate things—the earth, which is a material thing, and the spirit of the earth, a nonmaterial thing that inhabits the earth.</p><p id="f5fc5c47-e3e6-418e-bf81-9a35ee423b65" class="">Our planet earth is itself a true, great bodhisattva. It embodies so many great virtues. The earth is solid—it can carry so many things. It is patient—it takes its time moving glaciers and carving rocks. The earth doesn’t discriminate. We can throw fragrant flowers on the earth, or we can throw urine and excrement on the earth, and the earth purifies it. The earth has a great capacity to endure, and it offers so much to nourish us—water, shelter, food, and air to breathe.</p><p id="eb5da7fc-16e1-4a90-afc6-616a03914ee7" class="">When we recognize the virtues, the talent, the beauty of the earth bodhisattva, love is born. You love the earth and the earth loves you. You would do anything for the well-being of the earth. And the earth will do anything for your well-being. That is the natural outcome of the real loving relationship. The earth is not just your environment, to be taken care of or worshiped; you are each other. Every mindful step can manifest that love.</p><p id="e7d2abf7-38f7-41d2-a19d-cedafa8e2ad4" class="">Part of love is responsibility. In Buddhism, we speak of meditation as an act of awakening. To awaken is to be awake to something. We need to be awake to the fact that the earth is in danger and living species on earth are also in danger. When we walk mindfully, each step reminds us of our responsibility. We have to protect the earth with the same commitment we have to protect our family and ourselves. The earth can nourish and heal us but it suffers as well. With each step the earth heals us, and with each step we heal the earth.</p><p id="893941ea-c712-4af1-ad0e-a586b94dbab1" class="">When we walk mindfully on the face of the earth, we are grounded in her generosity and we cannot help but be grateful. All of the earth’s qualities of patience, stability, creativity, love, and nondiscrimination are available to us when we walk reverently, aware of our connection.</p><p id="17f03d92-a15f-4381-8e01-6117768ab90e" class="">Those of us who can walk on the earth, who can walk in freedom, should do it. If we rush from one place to another, without practicing walking meditation, it is such a waste. What is walking for? Walking is for nothing. It’s just for walking. That is our ultimate aim—walking in the spring breeze. We have to walk so that we have happiness, so that we can be a free person. We have to let go of everything, and not seek or long or search for anything. There is enough for us to be happy.</p><p id="9e0181bd-3134-4f71-9b2d-63fdab55522e" class="">All the Buddhist stories tell us that the Buddha had a lot of happiness when he sat, when he walked, when he ate. We have some experience of this. We know there are moments when we’re walking or sitting that we are so happy. We also know that there are times, because of illness or physical disability or because our mind is caught elsewhere, when we cannot walk freely like the Buddha. There are those of us who do not have the use of our legs. There are those of us who are in prison, like Sister Tri Hai, and only have a few feet of space. But we can all invite the Buddha to walk for us. When we have difficulty, we can leave that difficulty behind and let the Buddha walk for us. In a while the solidity of the earth can help us return to ourselves.</p><p id="c7a88137-5a8c-43a3-8123-b942ba84d66d" class="">We are made of body and mind. Our body can radiate the energy of peace and compassion. Our mind also has energy. The energy of the mind can be powerful. If the energy of the mind is filled with fear and anger, it can be very destructive. But if we sit mindfully, if we walk mindfully and reverently on the earth, we will generate the energies of mindfulness, of peace, and of compassion in both body and mind. This kind of energy can heal and transform.</p><p id="0b420df4-2af7-433a-8caf-1a9f4d03d200" class="">If you walk reverently on the earth with two other people, soaking in the earth’s solidity, you will all three radiate and benefit from the energy of peace and compassion. If three hundred people sit or walk like this, each one generates the energy of mindfulness, peace, and compassion, and everyone in the group receives that healing energy. The energy of peace and mindfulness does not come from elsewhere. It comes from us. It comes from our capacity to breathe, to walk, to sit mindfully and recognize the wonders of life.</p><p id="4faef12c-4d92-4a91-97e2-880c69e04c58" class="">When you walk reverently and solidly on this earth and I do the same, we send out waves of compassion and peace. It is this compassion that will heal ourselves, each other, and this beautiful green earth. Walk slowly, in a relaxed way. When you practice this way, your steps are those of the most secure person on earth. Feel the gravity that makes every step attach to the earth. With each step, you are grounded on the earth.</p><p id="3fc35a51-3fec-48eb-9ae1-20604b6c180d" class="">One way to practice walking meditation is to breathe in and take one step, and focus all your attention on the sole of your foot. If you have not arrived fully, 100 percent in the here and the now, don’t take the next step. I’m sure you can take a step like that because there is buddhanature in you. Buddhanature is the capacity of being aware of what is going on. It is what allows you to recognize what you are doing in the current moment and to say to yourself, I am alive, I am taking a step. Anyone can do this. There is a buddha in every one of us, and we should allow the buddha to walk.</p><p id="80c65085-881e-434c-a75c-179c02d1842d" class="">While walking, practice conscious breathing by counting steps. Notice each breath and the number of steps you take as you breathe in and as you breathe out. Don’t try to control your breathing. Allow your lungs as much time and air as they need, and simply notice how many steps you take as your lungs fill up and how many you take as they empty, mindful of both your breath and your steps. The link is the counting.</p><p id="734db1b8-4d02-4d35-a9ad-d295f99c9346" class="">When you walk uphill or downhill, the number of steps per breath will change. Always follow the needs of your lungs. You may notice that your exhalation is longer than your inhalation. You might find that you take three steps during your in-breath and four steps during your out-breath, or two steps, then three steps. If this is comfortable for you, please enjoy practicing this way. You can also try making the in-breath and the out-breath the same length, so that you take three steps with your in-breath and three with your out-breath. Keep walking and you will find the natural connection between your breath and your steps.</p><p id="5d49acf5-2883-49a7-bbe1-0caa0f429617" class="">Don’t forget to practice smiling. Your half-smile will bring calm and delight to your steps and your breath, and help sustain your attention. After practicing for half an hour or an hour, you will find that your breath, your steps, your counting, and your half-smile all blend together in a marvelous balance of mindfulness. Each step grounds us in the solidity of the earth.

Nansen, holding up the cat, said, “You monks! If you can say a word of Zen, I will spare the cat. Otherwise I will kill it.” No one could answer, so Nansen cut the cat in two. That evening, when Joshu returned, Nansen told him of the incident. Joshu thereupon took off his sandal, put it on his head, and walked off. Nansen said, “If you had been there, the cat would have been saved!</p><ul id="f4db09c0-73f6-4c00-897f-c39b378f087d" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>The Meaning of the Koan:</summary><p id="b721d3a4-ef8d-467e-9460-64c36831b908" class="">Once in a Zen monastery, a curious incident unfolded that became a story told for generations. The monks were deeply engaged in a debate about whether a cat, which had wandered into their hall, possessed Buddha-nature. This debate was intense, with the monks using all their intellectual prowess to argue their points.</p><p id="b03d13e3-1384-468e-901f-ad837177fcc1" class="">Observing this, the master of the monastery, Nansen, saw an opportunity to teach a profound lesson. He picked up the cat and, in a surprising move, threatened to &#x27;kill&#x27; it unless one of the monks could express a word of Zen. This drastic action was not about harming the cat but about jolting the monks out of their theoretical discussions into the realm of immediate, real experience. The monks, however, remained silent, trapped in their intellectual minds.</p><p id="a48fce9a-b9e8-49b2-9768-90897e7227ad" class="">Nansen&#x27;s &#x27;killing&#x27; of the cat was a symbolic act, representing a break from the dualistic, intellectual mindset that the monks were stuck in. It was a dramatic gesture meant to demonstrate the limitations of their intellectual debates and the need for a direct encounter with reality as it is.</p><p id="a9d6cbe4-4377-40e2-bb49-47aa87a1557e" class="">Later, when Joshu, a renowned disciple of Nansen, returned and learned of the incident, he responded in an unusual way. He placed a sandal on his head and walked out. This act, seemingly absurd and defying rationality, was a direct and intuitive expression of Zen. It was a way of demonstrating an understanding that transcends conventional thought and behavior.</p><p id="c3dfc51e-7847-48fa-b369-9887707ac318" class="">This story with Nansen, the cat, and Joshu&#x27;s response encapsulates the essence of Zen. It shows that Zen doesn&#x27;t conform to standard moral or rational frameworks but transcends them, offering a direct, experiential understanding of reality. The story underlines that enlightenment in Zen is not about intellectual comprehension but about a direct, immediate grasp of the moment, unclouded by thoughts or concepts. Joshu’s response, nonsensical in a conventional sense, was a profound expression of enlightenment, illustrating that true understanding in Zen is beyond words and logical understanding. It must be experienced personally and directly. This story continues to be a powerful illustration of the Zen approach to spirituality, challenging conventional modes of thought and pointing towards a profound, often paradoxical, understanding of reality.</p><details open=""><summary style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.25em;line-height:1.3;margin:0"><strong>The ELI5 Explanation </strong></summary><div class="indented"><p id="d207e902-a3ff-4cd1-89a5-48d1c72977ff" class="">Think of this as a instructon to look at the clouds in the sky.

Its beauty is accessible to everyone without diminishing anyone else&#x27;s enjoyment. Therefore, the experience of the moon is not limited to a certain number of people; it&#x27;s a shared, abundant resource. This serves to remind us that there are many wonderful things in life that we already possess but often overlook. All it takes is a moment of reflection to recognize them. However, our constant pursuit of material possessions often distracts us from appreciating what we already have. Consider other invaluable aspects of life that cannot be purchased, such as love, friendship, happiness, time, and dreams.</p></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><h2 id="4486a4b2-333c-4c45-97aa-a2b454970a8a" class="">Spiritual Stories</h2><ul id="b0b51889-c80c-49dc-bb57-502a475a7b10" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>A Story About Change</summary><p id="8a6fd042-1c59-4212-8041-b614fccb8224" class="">THE LARGE BLACK ants had made a path through the grass, across a stretch of sand, over a pile of rubble and through the gap in an ancient wall. A little beyond the wall was a hole which was their home. There was an extraordinary coming and going on that path, an incessant bustle in both directions. Each ant would hesitate a second as it went by another; their heads would touch, and on they would go again. There must have been thousands of them. Only when the sun was directly overhead was that path deserted, and then all activity would be centred around their nest near the wall; they were excavating, each ant bringing out a grain of sand, a pebble or a bit of earth. When you gently knocked on the ground nearby, there was a general scramble. They would pour out of the hole, looking for the aggressor; but soon they would settle down and resume their work. As soon as the sun was on its westerly course and the evening breeze blew pleasantly cool from the mountains, they would march out again on their path, populating the silent world of the grass, the sand and the rubble. They went along that path for quite a distance, hunting, and they would find so many things: the leg of a grasshopper, a dead frog, the remains of a bird, a half-eaten lizard or some grain. Everything was attacked with fury; what couldn’t be carried away was eaten on the spot, or taken home in pieces. Only rain stopped their constant activity, and with the last drops they were out again. If you put your finger on their path, they would feel all around the tip, and a few would climb up it, only to come down again.<br/>The ancient wall had a life of its own. Near the top there were holes in which bright green parrots, with curving red beaks, had made their nests. They were a shy lot, and didn’t like you to come too near. Screeching and clinging to the crumbling red bricks, they would wait to see what you were going to do. If you didn’t come any nearer, they would wriggle into the holes, leaving only their pale green tail feathers sticking out; there would then be another wriggle, the feathers would disappear, and their red beaks and shapely green heads would be showing. They were settling down for the night.<br/>The wall enclosed an ancient tomb whose dome, catching the last rays of the setting sun, glowed as if someone had turned on a light from within. The whole structure was well-built and splendidly proportioned; it had not a line that could jar you, and it stood out against the evening sky, seemingly freed from the earth. All things were intensely alive, and all things – the ancient tomb, the crumbling red bricks, the green parrots, the busy ants, the whistle of a distant train, the silence and the stars – were merged into the totality of life. It was a benediction.<br/>Although it was late, they had wanted to come, so we all went into the room. Lanterns had to be lit, and in the hurry one was broken, but the remaining two gave enough light for us to see each other as we sat in a circle on the floor. One of those who had come was a clerk in some office; he was small and nervous, and his hands were never still. Another must have had a little more money, for he owned a shop and had the air of a man who was making his way in the world. Heavily built and rather fat, he was inclined to easy laughter, but was now serious. The third visitor was an old man, and being retired, he explained, he had more time to study the Scriptures and perform puja, a religious ceremony. The fourth was an artist with long hair, who watched with a steady eye every movement, every gesture we made; he wasn’t going to miss anything. We were all silent for a while. Through the open window one or two stars could be seen, and the strong perfume of jasmine came into the room.<br/>‘I would like to sit quietly like this for a longer period,’ said the merchant. ‘It’s a blessing to feel this quality of silence, it has a healing effect; but I don’t want to waste time explaining my immediate feelings, and I suppose I had better get on with what I came to talk about. I have had a very strenuous life, more so than most people; and while I am not by any means a rich man, I am now comfortably well off. I have always tried to lead a religious life. I haven’t been too covetous, I have been charitable, and I haven’t deceived others unnecessarily; but when you are in business, you have sometimes to avoid telling the exact truth. I could have made a great deal more money, but I denied myself that pleasure. I amuse myself in simple ways but on the whole I have led a serious life; it could have been better, but it really hasn’t been bad. I am married, and have two children. Briefly, sir, that’s my personal history. I have read some of your books and attended your discourses, and I have come here to be instructed in how to lead a more deeply religious life. But I must let the other gentlemen talk.’<br/>‘My work is a rather tiresome routine, but I am not qualified for any other job,’ said the clerk. ‘My own needs are few, and I am not married; but I have to support my parents, and I am also helping my younger brother through college. I am not at all religious in the orthodox sense, but the religious life appeals to me very strongly. I am often tempted to give up everything and become a sannyasi, but a sense of responsibility to my parents and my brother makes me hesitate. I have meditated every day for many years, and since hearing your explanation of what real meditation is, I have tried to follow it; but it’s very difficult, at least for me, and I can’t seem to get into the way of it. Also, my position as a clerk, which requires me to work all day long at something in which I have not the slightest interest, is hardly conducive to higher thought. But I deeply crave to find the truth, if it’s ever possible for me to do so, and while I am young I want to set a right course for the rest of my life; so here I am.’<br/>‘For my part,’ said the old man, ‘I am fairly familiar with the Scriptures, and since retiring as a government official several years ago, my time is my own. I have no responsibilities; all my children are grown up and married, so I am free to meditate, to read, and to talk of serious things. I have always been interested in the religious life. From time to time I have listened attentively to one or other of the various teachers, but I have never been satisfied. In some cases their teachings are utterly childish, while others are dogmatic, orthodox and merely explanatory. I have recently been attending some of your talks and discussions. I follow a great deal of what you say, but there are certain points with which I cannot agree – or rather, which I don’t understand. Agreement, as you have explained, can exist with regard to opinions, conclusions, ideas, but there can be no ‘agreement’ with regard to truth; either one sees it, or one does not. Specifically, I would like further clarification on the ending of thought.’<br/>‘I am an artist, but not yet a very good one,’ said the man with the long hair. ‘I hope one day to go to Europe to study art; here we have mediocre teachers. To me, beauty in any form is an expression of reality; it’s an aspect of the divine. Before I start to paint I meditate, like the ancients, on the deeper beauty of life. I try to drink at the spring of all beauty, to catch a glimpse of the sublime, and only then do I begin my day’s painting. Sometimes it comes through, but more often it doesn’t; however hard I try, nothing seems to happen, and whole days, even weeks, are wasted. I have also tried fasting, along with various exercises, both physical and intellectual, hoping to awaken the creative feeling; but all to no avail. Everything else is secondary to that feeling, without which one cannot be a true artist, and I will go to the ends of the earth to find it. That is why I have come here.’<br/>All of us sat quietly for a time, each with his own thoughts. Are your several problems different, or are they similar, though they may appear to be different? Is it not possible that there is one basic issue underlying them all? ‘I am not sure that my problem is in any way related to that of the artist,’ said the merchant. ‘He is after inspiration, the creative feeling, but I want to lead a more deeply spiritual life.’ ‘That’s precisely what I want to do too,’ replied the artist, ‘only I have expressed it differently.’<br/>We like to think that our particular problem is exclusive, that our sorrow is entirely different from that of others; we want to remain separate at all costs. But sorrow is sorrow, whether it is yours or mine. If we don’t understand this, we cannot proceed; we shall feel cheated, disappointed, frustrated. Surely, all of us here are after the same thing; the problem of each is essentially the problem of all. If we really feel the truth of this, then we have already gone a long way in our understanding, and we can inquire together; we can help each other, listen to and learn from each other. Then the authority of a teacher has no meaning, it becomes silly. Your problem is the problem of another; your sorrow is the sorrow of another. Love is not exclusive. If this is clear, sirs, let us proceed.<br/>‘I think we all now see that our problems are not unrelated,’ replied the old man, and the others nodded in approval. Then what is our common problem? please don’t answer immediately, but let us consider. Is it not, sirs, that there must be a fundamental transformation in oneself? Without this transformation, inspiration is always transitory, and there is a constant struggle to recapture it; without this transformation, any effort to lead a spiritual life can only be very superficial, a matter of rituals, of the bell and the book; without this transformation, meditation becomes a means of escape, a form of self-hypnosis.<br/>‘That is so,’ said the old man. ‘Without a deep inward change, all effort to be religious or spiritual is a mere scratching on the surface.’ ‘I am entirely one with you, sir,’ added the man from the office. ‘I do feel that there must be a fundamental change in me, otherwise I shall go on like this for the rest of my life, groping, asking and doubting. But how is one to bring about this change?’ ‘I also can see that there must be an explosive change within myself if that which I am groping after is to come into being,’ said the artist. ‘A radical transformation in oneself is obviously essential. But, as that gentleman has already asked, how is such a change to be brought about?’<br/>Let us give our minds and hearts to the discovery of the manner of its happening. What is important, surely, is to feel the urgent necessity of changing fundamentally, and not merely be persuaded by the words of another that you ought to change. An exciting description may stimulate you to feel that you must change, but such a feeling is very superficial, and it will pass away when the stimulant is gone. But if you yourself see the importance of change, if you feel, without any form of compulsion, without any motivation or influence that radical transformation is essential, then this very feeling is the action of transformation.<br/>‘But how is one to have this feeling?’ asked the merchant. What do you mean by the word ‘how’? ‘Since I have not got this feeling for change, how can I cultivate it?’<br/>Can you cultivate this feeling? Must it not arise spontaneously from your own direct perception of the utter necessity for a radical transformation? The feeling creates its own means of action. By logical reasoning you may come to the conclusion that a fundamental change is necessary, but such intellectual or verbal comprehension does not bring about the action of change.<br/>‘Why not?’ asked the old man. Is not intellectual or verbal comprehension a superficial response? You hear, you reason, but your whole being does not enter into it. Your surface mind may agree that a change is necessary, but the totality of your mind is not giving its complete attention; it’s divided in itself. ‘Do you mean, sir, that the action of change takes place only when there’s total attention?’ asked the artist. Let’s consider it. One part of the mind is convinced that this fundamental change is necessary, but the rest of the mind is unconcerned; it may be in abeyance, or asleep, or actively opposed to such a change. When this happens, there’s a contradiction within the mind, one part wanting change, and the other being indifferent or opposed to change. The resulting conflict, in which that part of the mind which wants change is trying to overcome the recalcitrant part, is called discipline, sublimation, suppression; it is also called following the ideal. An attempt is being made to build a bridge over the gap of self-contradiction. There is the ideal, the intellectual or verbal comprehension that there must be a fundamental transformation and the vague but actual feeling of not wanting to be bothered, the desire to let things go on as they are the fear of change, of insecurity. So there’s a division in the mind; and the pursuit of the ideal is an attempt to bring together the two contradictory parts, which is an impossibility. We pursue the ideal because it doesn’t demand immediate action; the ideal is an accepted and respected postponement.<br/>‘Then is trying to change oneself always a form of postponement?’ asked the man from the office. Isn’t it? Haven’t you noticed that when you say, ‘I will try to change,’ you have no intention of changing at all? You either change, or you don’t; trying to change has actually very little significance. pursuing the ideal, attempting to change, compelling the two contradictory parts of the mind to come together by the action of the will, practising a method or a discipline to achieve such a unification, and so on – all this is useless and wasteful effort which actually prevents any fundamental transformation of the centre, the self, the ego.<br/>‘I think I understand what you are conveying,’ said the artist. ‘We are playing around with the idea of change, but never changing. Change requires drastic, unified action.’ Yes; and unified or integrated action cannot take place as long as there’s a conflict between opposing parts of the mind. ‘I see that, I really do!’ exclaimed the man from the office. ‘No amount of idealism, of logical reasoning, no convictions or conclusions, can bring about the change we are talking about. But then what will?’<br/>Are you not, by that very question, preventing yourself from discovering the action of change? We are so eager for results that we do not pause between what we have just discovered to be true or false, and the uncovering of another fact. We hasten forward without fully understanding what we have already found. We have seen that reasoning and logical conclusions will not bring about this change, this fundamental transformation of the centre. But before we ask ourselves what factor will bring it about, we must be fully aware of the tricks that the mind uses to convince itself that change is gradual and must be effected through the pursuit of ideals, and so on. Having seen the truth or the falseness of that whole process, we can proceed to ask ourselves what is the factor necessary for this radical change.<br/>Now, what is it that makes you move, act? ‘Any strong feeling. Intense anger makes me act; I may afterwards regret it, but the feeling explodes into action.’ That is, your whole being is in it; you forget or disregard danger, you are lost to your own safety, security. The very feeling is action; there is no gap between the feeling and the act. The gap is created by the so-called reasoning process, a weighing of the pros and the cons according to one’s convictions, prejudices, fears, and so on. Action is then political, it is stripped of spontaneity, of all humanity. The men who are seeking power, whether for themselves, their group or their country, act in this manner, and such action only breeds further misery and confusion.<br/>‘Actually,’ went on the man from the office, ‘even a strong feeling for fundamental change is soon erased by self-protective reasoning, by thinking what would happen if such a change took place in one, and so on.’ The feeling is then hedged about by ideas, by words, is it not? There is a contradictory reaction, born of the desire not to be disturbed. If that is the case, then continue in your old way; don’t deceive yourself by following the ideal, by saying that you are trying to change, and all the rest of it. Be simple with the fact that you don’t want to change. The realization of this truth is in itself sufficient.<br/>‘But I do want to change.’ Then change; but don’t talk unfeelingly about the necessity of changing. It has no meaning. ‘At my age,’ said the old man, ‘I have nothing to lose in the outward sense; but to give up the old ideas and conclusions is quite another matter. I now see at least one thing: that there can be no fundamental change without an awakening of the feeling for it. Reasoning is necessary, but it’s not the instrument of action. To know is not necessarily to act.’<br/>But the action of feeling is also the action of knowing, the two are not separate; they are separate only when reason, knowledge, conclusion or belief induces action. ‘I am beginning to see this very clearly, and my knowledge of the Scriptures, as a basis for action, is already losing its grip on my mind.’ Action based on authority is no action at all; it is mere imitation, repetition. ‘And most of us are caught in that process. But one can break away from it. I have understood a great deal this evening.’<br/>‘So have I,’ said the artist. ‘To me, this discussion has been highly stimulating, and I don’t think the stimulation will admit of any reaction. I have seen something very clearly, and I am going to pursue it, not knowing where it will lead.’ ‘My life has been respectable,’ said the merchant, ‘and respectability is not conducive to change, especially of the fundamental kind we have been talking about. I have cultivated very earnestly the idealistic desire to change, and to lead a more genuinely religious life; but I now see that meditation upon life and the ways of change is far more essential.’<br/>‘May I add yet another word?’ asked the old man. ‘Meditation is not upon life; it is itself the way of life.’<br/></p><ul id="fecf0772-08c5-4d98-a2d8-27a87e435ef2" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Meaning of the Story</summary><p id="eaad629f-b85f-48f1-938f-68a00a3dc936" class="">The discourse evolves into a collective insight that change, devoid of conflict or contradiction within oneself, requires a unified action stemming from an authentic desire for transformation. It critiques the dichotomy of ideal versus action, urging an embrace of change that is immediate and total, rather than incremental or hypothetical. The narrative culminates in an understanding that true action emerges from a harmony of feeling and knowing, dismissing authority-based actions as mere imitations. The exchange leaves each participant with a renewed perspective on life, the pursuit of change, and the essence of meditation as not just a reflection on life but as life itself, encapsulating the wisdom that the journey towards understanding and transformation is both individual and collective, rooted in the depth of shared human experience.</p></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><ul id="c1e3865e-138a-4ab1-9482-634e919cc468" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>A Wandering Seeker</summary><p id="40fff610-4e8e-45bf-b9b8-7045a9871ee9" class="">The story:</p><p id="8221e3f6-73bc-4664-87a6-f60130a64387" class="">A WANDERING SEEKER SAW A DERVISH IN A REST-HOUSE AND SAID TO HIM, &quot;I HAVE BEEN IN A HUNDRED CLIMES AND HEARD THE TEACHINGS OF A MULTITUDE OF MENTORS.

The seeker, who has traveled extensively and learned from numerous mentors, represents an approach to spirituality that is intellectual and skeptical. He prides himself on being able to identify false spiritual teachers but admits his inability to recognize or find a genuine guide. This reflects a mindset deeply rooted in skepticism and doubt, valuing intellectual discernment over experiential wisdom.</p><p id="30cfbecf-721d-4762-91cf-a61669551ff7" class="">The interpretation, drawing from Sufi perspectives, criticizes this approach. It emphasizes that true spiritual growth in Sufism is not about accumulating knowledge or hopping from one teacher to another. Instead, it&#x27;s about developing a deep, intimate relationship with a single spiritual master. This relationship is likened to a tree putting down roots in one place, allowing it to grow strong and tall. In contrast, the seeker&#x27;s approach is compared to a rolling stone that, despite its travels, gains no real substance or depth.</p><p id="b10fffbf-ab7b-451a-af51-5217e3113cac" class="">The story and its interpretation also highlight a fundamental aspect of Sufi thought: the value of sat sang, or being in the company of truth. This concept involves more than just physical proximity to a teacher; it&#x27;s about a deep, transformative communion that allows the disciple&#x27;s ego to dissolve and true spiritual insight to emerge. The seeker&#x27;s focus on intellectual discernment is seen as an obstacle to this deeper union, as it fosters a critical mindset rather than one of openness and surrender, which are crucial for spiritual growth in Sufism.</p><p id="94c15191-f859-4f34-b5d3-a54a638f76c8" class="">Furthermore, the interpretation contrasts different spiritual paths, noting the unique characteristics of Sufi masters, who are described as being &quot;drunk with God,&quot; radiating a palpable, loving presence. This is set against the backdrop of other traditions, like Zen Buddhism, which have different approaches and expressions of enlightenment.</p><p id="bc80a1ae-8483-4439-8b6e-1b3d360dc87e" class="">In summary, the story and its meaning underscore a fundamental Sufi teaching: the journey towards spiritual enlightenment is not about accumulating knowledge or being skeptical, but about deepening one&#x27;s heart and soul through a committed, loving relationship with a spiritual guide. This path involves surrender, patience, and a transformative process that goes beyond intellectual understanding to a profound experience of the divine.</p><p id="4cf4a0ca-182d-4786-8841-a92f28cd69ef" class="">

And unless you join yourself with the source of life again, you will not be healthy. Only in God is health and wholeness and holiness. Only the presence of God heals. But we have forgotten completely about God. We have started living on our own, as if a tree has forgotten about its roots and has started living in the branches - it is going to die, it will become ill.</p><p id="daa21619-a5e7-44c9-becf-9ae2001aa4f0" class="">That&#x27;s why the whole of humanity is ill. And Freud and company are right about ninety-nine point nine percent of people: people are ill! They are no more connected with the source of life. But that point one percent is the hope. There are people who are connected with life.</p><p id="da94711d-fbde-43a3-a1c8-8b69f998c02c" class="">And I would like to say to this philosopher: there are people whose health is contagious. When a Buddha moves, his very movement heals people.</p><p id="b51eaf1c-822e-4ece-8174-2307cffd6325" class="">That is the meaning of the miracles of Jesus - the miracles that he heals blind people and suddenly eyes are there, and he heals the deaf and dumb and they start listening and tallying, and he heals the crippled and they are no more crippled. These are payables. It is not about the physical crippledness: it is something about the spiritual crippledness. And whenever a man of God moves, or people who are fortunate come and live in the company of a man of God, they ARE healed, spiritually healed. Their spiritual wounds start disappearing, they again start growing roots. And soon the roots find the sources of life, the waters of life, and all is green again, and all is blooming again. And the spring has come, and the celebration.</p></div></details></details></li></ul><h1 id="f2b21e5c-a469-472a-ab9b-ae46e50d27fc" class="">Religions and Teachings</h1><ul id="18c33670-5d3c-4bea-98ce-0b889b66a824" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Zen versus Sufism</summary><p id="f0673467-b86a-48f7-bb42-6393c1f4df29" class="">EXISTENCE IS A DIALECTICS. IT DEPENDS ON POLAR OPPOSITES: man/woman, yin/yang, life/death, daylight. But the basic polarity in all the polarities is that of positive and negative. Only positive cannot exist, neither can the negative exist alone. They depend on each other. They are opposites and yet not opposites.</p><p id="360cfa5c-b376-4230-8aff-73dd6d7347f6" class="">If you understand this, you have a great key in your hands: they are opposites and yet complement Aries, because they cannot exist without the other. The other feeds them - negates them and feeds them. And the whole existence progresses. moves, flows, because of these two polar banks. No river can flow without these two banks.</p><p id="083a1aa9-8056-4848-9a41-54d8eb5a940f" class="">Everything is divided into these polar opposites. They attract each other, they repel each other. Just like man and woman: they are attracted to each other and they are repelled by each other; they want to come close and they resist; they love and they hate - and it is all together. You cannot separate them. You cannot separate love and hate because you cannot separate the positive and the negative. At the most, you can emphasize one more than the other - that&#x27;s all.</p><p id="65be09db-eda0-4da0-9918-45de13cd50e8" class="">Just the other day, Yoga Chinmaya has asked a question: &quot;Why does man have two eyes, two ears, two lungs, two kidneys, two hands, two feet - why two?&quot; Because of the polarity. Your one kidney is male, your other kidney is female. Your one hemisphere of the mind is male, your other hemisphere is female. You cannot exist without this polarity. Your body will disappear. There is a constant opposition between the poles, and attraction.</p><p id="d939e453-ed46-4b20-ba71-f6f8a3e45576" class="">One of the greatest discoveries of modern psychology is that no man is just man alone, and no woman is woman alone either.

I am saying this so that I can explain to you why there is such a phenomenon as Zen-and-Sufism - they are polar opposites. Zen is the path of VIA NEGATIVE; it is basically male- oriented. It is the path of intelligence, meditation, awareness. Sufism is the path of VIA POSITIVE; it is feminine. It is the path of love, affirmation.</p><p id="6fdaf792-c055-40d1-b2a3-ea9a11369f8a" class="">The Buddhist moves by negating: This is not the truth, that is not the truth - NET I, NET I - neither this nor that, says Sosan. Go on negating, eliminating. When you have eliminated all, that which remains and cannot be eliminated any more is the truth.</p><p id="fe6ea5bc-0797-4264-8fb6-22e9239f01c9" class="">Sufism is based on positivity: Don&#x27;t negate, don&#x27;t use no, say yes. And don&#x27;t search in a negative way; move in an absolutely positive way. Don&#x27;t think of the wrong, think of the right. Don&#x27;t think of illness, think of health. Don&#x27;t think of thorns, think of flowers. Don&#x27;t think of ugliness, misery, think of beauty and joy.</p><p id="262f6d00-a322-404c-9b4d-dbd7d300c89d" class="">Both are there. And you cannot use both together - you will go mad if you use both together. That&#x27;s really what happens when a man goes mad. He starts using both his polarities and both those polarities go on negating each other. That&#x27;s why he becomes paralyzed in his intelligence. One has to use one; the other will be there but as a shadow, just complementary to it.</p><p id="833eb05b-a94a-4225-8ba2-39b31856d275" class="">In Zen you use no, and, slowly slowly, all that is meaningless is cut from the very roots. But the meaning remains, because meaning cannot be cut. The significance remains; that is impos-sible to destroy, it is indestructible. So there is no problem! People who follow Zen reach. They reach to health by eliminating diseases. That is their way.</p><p id="3c997f41-e18c-4a7c-adee-2f5121d7de0c" class="">The Sufi way is just the opposite: it moves through the positive, through health, through yes-saying.</p><p id="8938ee19-e51b-4fd5-9b1d-77e4a4aa2eca" class="">And, slowly slowly, it arrives at the same goal. And, in a way, the path of the Sufi is more full of joy, more full of songs, because it flows through the valleys and mountains of love.</p><p id="08b1d670-3049-4650-8bba-9813dab37d88" class="">Zen flows through a desert land. The desert also has its own beauty - the silence of it, the vastness of it, the purity of its air - the desert has its own beauty! If you are a lover of the desert, don&#x27;t be worried about it. People have reached through the desert to the ultimate. But if you are not, then there is no need to torture yourself in the desert. There are green valleys too.</p><p id="6282f155-a8d0-447e-9522-02ac0cab8cf0" class="">Sufism moves through green valleys. Now this too is very strange, but this is how the mind functions:</p><p id="10aa4d77-9aba-435b-9778-68075255e851" class="">Sufism was born in a desert; Zen was born in a green valley. Maybe that&#x27;s why it happened so. The people who live in a desert can&#x27;t choose the path of Zen. They are already in a desert, tired of the desert. Outside is the expanse of desert and desert alone. They would not like to choose the inner desert too; otherwise, the polarity will be lost. Outside is desert, inside they have to create a green valley of love, of positivity. That will make things balanced. That will help the dialectical process.</p><p id="feebf1fe-9718-4f2d-9042-1bddd68c0583" class="">Sufis talk about love, of paradise, of the garden of paradise. They think of God as the Beloved. They talk about wine; wine is their symbol. They talk about drunkenness; they are drunkards, drunkards of the divine. They abandon themselves in dance and song. They feast, they celebrate. That seems absolutely logical. Enough of the desert - they have to balance it by an inner garden.</p><p id="74e2cb0d-aaf1-4ec0-b85e-006f47c010f0" class="">Buddhism was born on the banks of the Ganges, one of the most fertile lands in the world, one of the most beautiful, in the shadows of the Himalayas. All was beautiful outside, all was green outside.</p><p id="f5a73032-673c-4e5d-a831-b037f1e15759" class="">Now to think of greenery inside too will be monotonous. To think of beautiful valleys and rivers will be boring. Buddha thinks of inner emptiness, nothingness, the inner desert, the silence of the desert, the utter purity of the desert - no dance, no song. You cannot imagine Buddha dancing.</p><p id="dae133e4-a8cb-42fd-a8e6-869ac1dd13bc" class="">You cannot imagine Rumi not dancing. If Rumi is anything at all, he is nothing but a dance. He attained to his first samadhi by dancing continuously for thirty-six hours. He danced and danced...</p><p id="c183480f-6440-4ae0-9fb7-f0ada1548e2a" class="">and his ecstasy was such that hundreds of people started dancing. He created such a field of ecstasy that whosoever came to watch what had happened to him started dancing. By the time he reached his ultimate samadhi, thousands of people were dancing around him. That&#x27;s how he attained. He fell on the ground for hours in utter drunkenness - just like a drunkard!When he opened his eyes, he had seen the other world, he had brought the beyond with him.</p><p id="d6bd372a-25be-4756-8961-6548265a4caf" class="">Buddha attained to his ultimate samadhi sitting silently doing nothing - so utterly silent that you could have thought that there was no man but just a marble statue. It is not just a coincidence that Buddha&#x27;s statues were the first to be made, it started with Buddha&#x27;s statues. His statues were the first, then others&#x27; statues followed. He was so statue-like. In his silence, sitting under the Bodhi Tree, he must have looked like a piece of marble: cool, white, still. The white marble became a metaphor for Buddha.</p><p id="dac76eab-f225-45bb-9d30-7423800cbeb0" class="">But you cannot make a statue of Rumi, because he is never for two consecutive moments in the same posture. If you want to make a statue of Rumi, you will have to make a statue of a fountain, or a willow in a strong wind. Impossible to make a statue of Rumi.</p><p id="c2190405-bfe6-4862-abc9-cb4f4238e1b8" class="">Buddha lived, was born, in Nepal under the shadows of the eternal Himalayas and its eternal beauty.</p><p id="33ee385e-0671-4cab-af0e-20550626cc44" class="">This is again a polarity. Outside is the beauty of the Himalayas, and Buddha searches for an inner desert of absolute negation. Rum I lived in a desert; outside is the infinite desert, inside he creates a small garden, a paradise, a walled garden. That is the meaning of the word &#x27;paradise&#x27;,firdaus - a walled garden, an oasis.</p><p id="494c95c6-8efc-4f81-980e-1ac950dfba7e" class="">Sufism&#x27;s emphasis is on the positive. And I am talking about both Zen and Sufi. You have to choose.</p><p id="5f813e72-5afd-4bf2-9a6a-2d89cacc379d" class="">The choice should not be from the head; the choice should be from your totality. Feel both. Feel Sufi dancing, and feel vipassana. And whatsoever fits with you... and when something fits, you will know. There will be no need to ask anybody, because it fits SO absolutely - that it is meant for you and you are meant for it - suddenly everything falls in tune, a great harmony arises.</p><p id="f756305d-1a51-4d83-9a33-72eed4e8ba14" class="">Don&#x27;t decide from the head, because then you can move in a wrong direction. Allow it to be decided by your total being. Feel all the possibilities - that&#x27;s why I am making all that is possible available to you, so everybody can find what suits him. Then that is your path.</p><p id="c5d28b0c-5e83-44e2-bf8c-436b23f26e5b" class="">And never impose your path on anybody else, never, because that may not be the path for the other. Share your joy, but never try to convert anybody to your principle. Share your experience, but never become a missionary. The word &#x27;missionary&#x27; is dirty. Make your heart available - if somebody wants to choose, let him choose, but don&#x27;t in any way, not even indirectly, try to convert him to your doctrine.</p><p id="0a94eaef-544a-4aa7-901d-4983d3f05eca" class="">Your experience, your sharing of the experience, is beautiful - it is your love, it is your compassion.</p><p id="5b9c9e2a-5b14-4353-8a4c-f5042ab7654b" class="">But your principle, your doctrine, your path, is dangerous. It may not be the other&#x27;s path. And when I am saying &#x27;the other&#x27;, I don&#x27;t mean the stranger - it may be your child, it may be your wife, it may be your husband, it may be your brother. &#x27;The other&#x27; includes ALL others - even your child whom you have carried in your womb for nine months, who is your bone and your blood and your marrow, who has pulsated with you for nine months, but still he will have to live his own life. He comes through you, but he is not you. He has his own indi-viduality. He has to bloom in his own way. Make available all that you have experienced, all that is good and all that is bad; make your whole life open to the child, but never indoctrinate him. Never try to make him a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan.</p><p id="c5330201-b1c6-4239-8a56-78311866e5d3" class="">Help him to move according to HIS nature.

That is love.</p><p id="21f887f8-5df5-40a4-b635-153e1eee01d5" class="">When you start indoctrinating, that is not love, that is hate. You are afraid, you are possessive, you are ambitious, you are egoistic You want to dominate the other through your doctrine. You want to kill the spirit of the other. You may think that you are helping, but you are not helping - you are hindering the growth. You are only crippling the other. He will never be able to forgive you.</p><p id="b388a28d-55ac-46ab-8264-4328ef068d49" class="">That&#x27;s why children are never able to forgive their parents - they have been indoctrinated, something has been forced on them. It is a kind of rape, and the worst kind: you have raped their consciousness. You have violated one of the MOST fundamental laws of life. You have interfered with their freedom. And the greatest freedom is the freedom to grow towards God, and everybody has to grow in his own way.</p><p id="f220ce5c-9558-4d59-85a0-3cc1d6612fda" class="">The rose has to offer its fragrance, and so does the marigold. The marigold need not become a rose, it cannot. The marigold has to bloom in its own way; it has to offer itself.

And there is no hurry. Go on feeling.

This dream was interpreted by Brahmins (learned men) that the child would be either the greatest king in the world or the greatest ascetic (a holy man who practices self-denial), and would be named Siddhartha, (meaning &quot;he whose aim is accomplished&quot;).</p><p id="b66f27f0-876c-4859-8382-20a174c2b5a2" class="">Later when Queen Maya was going to her father&#x27;s home to prepare for the birth, she stepped off her chariot in the Lumbini Gardens and held the branch of a sal tree to rest. In that instant, Siddhartha emerged from her right side without any help. The infant walked seven steps each in four directions of the compass, and lotus flowers sprouted from where his foot touched the earth. Then the infant said, &quot;No further births have I to endure, for this is my last body. Now shall I destroy and pluck out by the roots the sorrow that is caused by birth and death.&quot; Seven days later Queen Maya died. Mahaprajapati, Maya&#x27;s sister, looked after Siddhartha. King Shuddhodana shielded Siddhartha from all kinds of suffering and hardship. When Siddhartha was about 20, he married Yasodhara, daughter of one of the King&#x27;s ministers, and one year later they had a child named Rahula (meaning &quot;fetter&quot; or &quot;impediment&quot;).</p><p id="cd212efc-7146-46d8-b804-9717b460833b" class="">At age 29, Siddhartha asked his charioteer, Channa, to take him out of the city two times without the consent of the king. During these two trips, Siddhartha saw &quot;Four Sights&quot; that changed his life. On the first trip, he saw old age, sickness, and death. The second trip, he saw a wandering holy man, an ascetic, with no possessions. Siddhartha started questioning the holy man, who had a shaved head, wore only a ragged yellow robe, and carried a walking-staff. The man said, &quot;I am... terrified by birth and death and therefore have adopted a homeless life to win salvation... I search for the most blessed state in which suffering, old age, and death are unknown.&quot; That night, Siddhartha silently kissed his sleeping wife and son, and ordered Channa to drive him out to the forest. At the edge of the forest, Siddhartha took off his jeweled sword, and cut off his hair and beard. He then took off all his princely garments and put on a yellow robe of a holy man. He then ordered Channa to take his possessions back to his father.</p><p id="ad41dcea-3c44-4daa-8f73-ead555ef379b" class="">Siddhartha then wandered through northeastern India, sought out holy men, and learned about Samsara (reincarnation), Karma, and Moksha. Attracted to the ideas of Moksha, Siddhartha settled on the bank of Nairanjana River, and adopted a life of extreme self-denial and penances, meditating constantly. After six years of eating and drinking only enough to stay alive, his body was emaciated, and he was very weak. Five other holy men joined him, hoping to learn from his example.</p><p id="61950fe4-8e30-45a8-bc76-4a43ccacfcef" class="">One day, Siddhartha realized that his years of penance only weakened his body, and he could not continue to meditate properly. When he stepped into the river to bathe, he was too weak to get out, and the trees lowered their branches to help him. In that instant, a milk-maid named Nandabala came and offered a bowl of milk and rice, which Siddhartha accepted. The five holy men left Siddhartha after witnessing this. Refreshed by the meal, Siddhartha sat down under a fig tree (often refered to as the Bo tree, or Tree of Enlightenment) and resolved to find out an answer to life and suffering. While meditating, Mara (an evil god) sent his three sons and daughters to tempt Siddhartha with thirst, lust, discontent, and distractions of pleasure. Siddhartha, unswayed, entered a deep meditation, and recalled all his previous rebirths, gained knowledge of the cycle of births and deaths, and with certainty, cast off the ignorance and passion of his ego which bound him to the world. Thereupon, Siddhartha had attained enlightenment and became the Buddha (enlightened one). His own desire and suffering were over and, as the Buddha, he experienced Nirvana... &quot;There is a sphere which is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor air...which is neither this world nor the other world, neither sun nor moon. I deny that it is coming or going, enduring, death or birth. It is only the end of suffering.&quot; Instead of casting off his body and his existence, however, Buddha made a great act of self-sacrifice. He turned back, determined to share his enlightement with others so that all living souls could end the cycles of their own rebirth and suffering.</p><p id="7adcbd6b-e234-4b8a-9228-e97e5eb78c3a" class="">Buddha went to the city of Sarnath and found the previous five holy men that deserted him earlier at a deer park. When they saw Buddha this time, they realized that he had risen to a higher state of holiness. The Buddha began teaching them what he had learned. He drew a circle in the ground with rice grains, representing the wheel of life that went on for existence after existence. This preaching was called his Deer Park Sermon, or &quot;Setting in Motion the Wheel of Doctrine.&quot; Siddhartha revealed that he had become the Buddha, and described the pleasure that he had first known as a prince, and the life of severe asceticism that he had practiced. Neither of these was the true path to Nirvana. The true path was the Middle Way, which keeps aloof from both extremes.</p><p id="af2b6b06-98ef-4dad-b97c-4ab9c7bccb6a" class="">&quot;To satisfy the necessities of life is not evil,&quot; the Buddha said. &quot;To keep the body in good health is a duty, for otherwise we shall not be able to trim the lamp of wisdom and keep our mind strong and clear.&quot; Buddha then taught them the Dharma, which consisted of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. The five holy men and others soon joined Buddha, accompanying him everywhere. As more joined, Buddha organized the Sangha, a community of bhikkus (dedicated monks and later nuns). The Sangha preserved the Dharma, and allowed bhikkus to concentrate on the goal of Nirvana. On raining seasons they would settle in Viharas (resting places in cave dwellings). Upasaka, followers who believed in Buddha&#x27;s teachings, but could not follow the stict rule of the Sangha, were taught to follow the Five Precepts. Buddha returned to his birthplace in Kapilavastu, and his father was mortified to see his son begging for food. Buddha kissed his father&#x27;s foot and said, &quot;You belong to a noble line of kings. But I belong to the lineage of buddhas, and thousands of those have lived on alms.&quot; King Shuddhadana then remembered the Brahmin&#x27;s prophesy and reconciled with his son. Buddha&#x27;s wife, son, and cousin (Ananda) later joined the Sangha.</p><p id="59732160-d1c1-4580-aaa3-078d48db5ab4" class="">When Buddha was about eighty, a blacksmith named Cuanda gave him a meal that caused him to become ill. Buddha forced himself to travel to Kushinagara, and laid down on his right side to rest in a grove of shala trees. As a crowd of followers gathered, the trees sprouted blossoms and showered them on Buddha. Buddha told Ananda, &quot;I am old and my journey is near its end. My body is like a worn-out cart held together only by the help of leather straps.&quot; Three times, Buddha asked the people if they had any questions, but they all remained silent. Finally Buddha said, &quot;Everything that has been created is subject to decay and death. Everything is transitory. Work out your own salvation with diligence. After passing through several states of meditation, the Buddha died, reaching Parinirvana (the cessation of perception and sensation).</p></details></li></ul><ul id="779bb28e-2a71-48fd-b8a4-2d28b0044115" class="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary>Buddha, Buddhism: Watchfulness</summary><p id="303a1a3c-e4ad-48b2-b0d8-47e04be281ca" class="">Buddha&#x27;s teaching emphasizes the importance of watchfulness and the futility of dwelling on what is right or wrong. When you engage in this moral contemplation, you become divided and, at times, hypocritical. You may find yourself inclined to pretend to do what is right while secretly engaging in what is wrong.</p><p id="3f07e6b9-a22e-4e4e-bf40-ff23c358eb2c" class="">Consider a scenario where you spot a hundred-rupee note on the side of the road, possibly fallen from someone&#x27;s pocket. Two conflicting voices emerge within you. One voice argues, &quot;Taking it is perfectly right; no one will notice, and it&#x27;s not theft—it&#x27;s simply lying there. If you don&#x27;t take it, someone else will. Why miss out? It&#x27;s the right thing to do!&quot;</p><p id="4edfe70f-5f98-450d-9a32-81563b052037" class="">On the other hand, the other voice insists, &quot;This is wrong; the money doesn&#x27;t belong to you. It&#x27;s a form of theft, albeit indirect. You should either inform the authorities or choose to ignore it entirely. Taking it would be greed, and greed is sinful.&quot;</p><p id="d6c6ffaf-080a-434a-b9e4-57c4ae3b6b96" class="">In such moments, you tend to identify with the moralizing voice because it boosts your ego. You feel like a virtuous person, distinct from the ordinary who would take the money. However, in reality, you might still choose to take the note. You&#x27;ll condemn the part of you that considers taking it, distancing yourself and asserting, &quot;It&#x27;s not right. It&#x27;s the sinful part of me, the lower, condemned aspect. I was against it. My consciousness knew it was wrong.&quot;</p><p id="4a6ad3d2-b07b-4ab8-9828-8150fe9157be" class="">This tendency to identify with the moral perspective while disidentifying from the immoral action leads to hypocrisy.

The mind plays both sides, advocating for good and bad, creating inner conflict. The mind thrives on duality and opposition. Do not attach yourself to either side.</p><p id="376313ab-01d4-4968-9d00-0ce4b395557f" class="">Buddha&#x27;s guidance is to become a mere observer, a state of pure watchfulness. Recognize that one part of your mind voices one perspective, while another part voices another. You are neither of these voices—NETI, NETI—neither this nor that. You are solely a witness. This detached watchfulness opens the door to true understanding.</p><p id="0e0597b6-f310-4133-bff7-605f4ffce049" class="">Transcending judgments of good and bad is the path of watchfulness. Transformations occur through this watchful state. This is the distinction between morality and spirituality. Morality dictates, &quot;Choose the right and reject the wrong, choose the good and reject the bad.&quot; Spirituality advises, &quot;Simply observe both without choosing. Reside in a state of choiceless consciousness.&quot;</p></details></li></ul></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span></body></html>
