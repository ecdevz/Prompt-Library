Media Trends


Top 5 Media Trends

1. The Continuing Decline of TV: TV viewership has been in decline for recent years with the viewers now halved since ten years ago. More and more people are choosing on-demand streaming services.

As digital natives, Gen Z members have grown up with the internet and social media, which have provided them with platforms to express their opinions and advocate for the changes they want to see in the world. One key area where Gen Z demands significant change is in media representation. This generation tends to seek out and support media that portrays a wide array of experiences and identities. They often push for accurate and nuanced portrayals of different cultures, races, and genders, moving beyond tokenism to more substantive, complex characters and storylines. The demand for diversification is also evident in the way Gen Z consumes media. They are more likely to support creators and platforms that align with their values of inclusivity and representation. Streaming services, social media, and gaming platforms that offer a variety of perspectives are particularly popular among this demographic. Moreover, Gen Z is also not shy about calling out instances where media falls short. Social media campaigns and discussions about representation in movies, TV shows, and other forms of media are common. These can sometimes lead to tangible changes, such as re-casting roles, altering storylines, or even the creation of new content that better reflects the diversity of the audience.
4. Financial Flux and Media Maneuvering: The media industry is navigating through a period of financial flux, accentuated by recent economic headwinds such as inflation and shifts in consumer spending.

5. Holistic Audience Analytics: The need for a consolidated view of audience behavior across various media platforms is becoming more pronounced, with the aim of enhancing both customer engagement and advertising efficacy.
