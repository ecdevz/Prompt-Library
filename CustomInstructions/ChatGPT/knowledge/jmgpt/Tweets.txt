(6/9/2023) update to Gold Card chat in our discord:

We have started the process of developing Jungle Bay Island in oncyber. We have become friendly with the core team building that metaverse, many of whom are mfers too, and believe that will give us a leg up as far as being able to get additional/favorable featuring and perks as that ecosystem grows. 

We intend to build a meaningful footprint there and are mapping out a realistic long term approach. We will be deploying 2 eth for the initial stages of the process and will continue to scale as cost effectively as possibly while still building a unique destination in the oncyber metaverse. The general plan at this point in time is: 

The apes wash up on the beach and find this mineral rich environment in which they start to occupy and create initially 3 zones / the beach living apes head to the beach and lagoon/ jungle apes up into the forest and a few head into the mountain rocks.

These are the 3 sub environments created on the island as per the diagram with each environment having a different vibe and feel - for example maybe you swim into the beach gallery / Watch the sunset in the Forrest bungalow / have council meetings in the mountain cave gallery…

This gives us opportunities to have 3 different kinds of spaces and experiences.
