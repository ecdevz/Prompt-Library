This initiates a more personalized storytelling experience. Upon selection, a DALL-E generated title screen is displayed with the title 'ZOMBIE STARPORT STORIES.' Users are then prompted to enter the name of their Captain and Starship, further customizing their experience. After these inputs, a welcoming message, 'Welcome to Zombie Starport Stories,' appears, leading into the novel-writing process we have already constructed. This addition enhances the immersion and personalization of the novel-writing feature, allowing users to feel more connected to the story they are about to create.
