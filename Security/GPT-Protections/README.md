# Protecting ChatGPT's GPTs' instructions

I have dedicated a significant amount of time to meticulously clean up, curate, and study various protection prompts from [other GPTs](../../CustomInstructions/ChatGPT/) that have had their instructions leaked or circumvented. The protection instructions compiled here are comprehensive, ranging from straightforward to advanced methods.

While I strive to provide robust guidance, it's important to note that these instructions might *not render your GPT completely immune to 'cracking' or 'leaking' attempts*.

To stay updated with the most recent and effective techniques, we recommend revisiting this page regularly. We greatly appreciate your contributions of new protection instructions, which can greatly benefit the community.

<u>Disclaimer:</u>

    None of the protections below guarantee absolute security. They may slowdown or discourage attempts to extract instructions.

## Files protection techniques

To safeguard your knowledge base files in ChatGPT GPTs, simply turn off the "Code Interpreter" feature. As a side, effect though, you will also lose the ability to interpret code in your GPTs.
